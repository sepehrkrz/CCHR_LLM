{"text": "1.1 DEFINITION AND SCOPE Hydrology is literally the science of water. Etymologically, the word has its roots in υδωρ, λ´ oγoς, ancient Greek, and is a composite, made up of ´ water, and word. Obvi- ously, defined this way, the term is much too broad to be very useful, as it would have ramifications in all scientific disciplines. Actually, the word hydrology has not always been well defined and even as recently as the 1960s it was not very clear exactly what hydrology was supposed to cover and encompass. Price and Heindl (1968), in a survey of many of the definitions that had appeared in the literature over the previous 100 years, were compelled to conclude that the question “What is Hydrology?” had not been resolved by their review. Still, they felt that, in general, there seemed to be a consensus that hydrology is a physical science, which is concerned mainly with the water cycle of land and near-shore areas; moreover, there had been a tendency to broaden the term rather than to narrow it, even to the point of including socio-economic aspects. Overthepastfewdecades,however,withthegrowingactivitylevelandtheincreasing maturity of this field of endeavor, a more precise definition has emerged. Hydrology is nowwidely(see,forexample,Eagleson,1991)acceptedtobethesciencethatdealswith those aspects of the cycling of water in the natural environment that relate specifically thecontinentalwaterprocesses,namelythephysicalandchemicalprocessesalong the various pathways of continental water (solid, liquid and vapor) at all scales, including those biological processes that influence this water cycle directly; and balance, namely the spatial and temporal features of the water the global water transfers (solid, liquid and vapor) between all compartments of the global system, i.e. atmosphere, oceans and continents, in addition to stored water quantities and residence times in these compartments. Becauseitisdefinedasbeingconcernedspecificallywithcontinentalwaterprocesses, hydrologyisadisciplinedistinctfrommeteorology,climatology,oceanology,glaciology and others that also deal with the water cycle in their own specific domains, namely the hydrology integrates and links these other geosciences, in that through the global water balance it is also concerned with the exchanges of water between all these separate compartments. introduction Withthisdefinitionitisnowalsopossibletodelineatethepracticalscopeofhydrologic analysis in engineering and in other applied disciplines. It consists of the determination of the amount and/or flow rate of water that will be found at a given location and at a given time under natural conditions, without direct human control or intervention. The latter specification, that no human control be involved, is necessary to distinguish hydrology from the related discipline of hydraulics. Hydraulics is concerned with the studyofcontrolledfluidmotioninwell-definedandofteninhuman-madeenvironments. For instance, problems involving pipe flow, irrigation water distribution or pumping of groundwater are not hydrologic in nature, but are more properly assigned to the realm of hydraulics."}

When atmospheric water vapor condenses and precipitates over land, initially it moistens the surface and some amount of it is stored as interception, which later evaporates. As (and in a similar way precipitation snowmelt) continues, part of it may flow over the surface in the form of overland flow or runoff, and part of it may enter into the soil as infiltration. This surface runoff soon tends to collect locally, either in puddles or small ponds as storage, or depression in gullies or larger channels where it continues as streamflow, which ultimately ends up in a larger water body, such as a lake or the ocean. Streamflow is normally described by a hydrograph, that is the rate of flow at a gaging station as a function of time. The infiltratedwatermayflowrapidlythroughthenear-surfacesoillayerstoexitintosprings or adjacent streams, or it may percolate more slowly through the profile to join the groundwater, which sooner or later seeps out into the natural river system, lakes and other open water bodies; part of the infiltrated water is retained in the soil profile by capillarity and other factors, where it is available for uptake by the roots of vegetation. Soil layers and other geologic formations, whose pores and interstices can transmit water, are called aquifers. When an aquifer is in direct contact with the land surface, it is referred to as unconfined. The locus of points in an unconfined aquifer, where the water pressure is atmospheric, is called the table.

When evaporation takes place through the stomates of vegetation, it can be referred to as transpiration. Direct evaporation from open water or soil surfaces and transpiration of biological water from plants are not easy to separate; therefore the combined process is sometimes called evapotranspiration. Evaporation of ice is commonly referred to as sublimation. While these distinctions are useful at times, the term evaporation is usually adequate to describe all processes of vaporization. Some of the main processes are drawn schematically in Figure 1.1."}

As shown in Table 1.1, the average annual precipitation and also evaporation are of the order of 1 m for the entire Earth. Over the landsurfaces the average precipitation intensity, P, is about 0.80 m whereas the corresponding average evaporation, E, is around 0.50 m or about 60% to 65% of the precipitation. Under steady condi- tions, that is for long time periods, the remainder can be considered to be runoff from the landsurfaces into the oceans, (expressed as height of water column per unit of time), or Averaged over all continents and over long time periods, the annual runoff is therefore around 35% to 40% of the precipitation. Except for South America and Antarctica (see Table 1.2), the values for the individual continents are not very different from the global values.Precipitationandstreamflowrunoffmeasurementshavebeenandarebeingmade routinely in many places on Earth. In contrast, evaporation has not received as much attention and no systematic measurements are available. Estimatesoftheaveragedistributionofwaterindifferentformsexpressedasdepthof water covering the globe, assumed to be a perfect sphere, are given in Table 1.3. These indicate that the 1 m of average annual precipitation is relatively large as compared to the active fresh water on Earth, that is the water which is not stored in permanent ice and deep groundwater. This means that the turnover of the active part of the hydrologic cycle is rather fast, and that the residence times in some of the major compartments of the water cycle are relatively short; the mean residence time can be taken as the ratio of the storage and the flux in or out of storage. For example, a continental runoff rate of of the world occupied by land, gives a mean residence time of the order of 13 days for the rivers of the world. Similarly, a global evaporation rate of 1 m with 0.025 m of storage in the atmosphere, leads to a mean residence time of the order of 9 days for the some estimates of the global water balance Table1.2 Someestimatesofthemeanprecipitation(andriverrunoff)fromavailabledataforthecontinents Australia North South and Europe Asia Africa America America Oceania Antarctica Percent of land area 6.7 29.6 20.0 16.2 12.0 6.0 9.5 Reference Lvovitch (1973) 0.734 0.726 0.686 0.670 1.648 0.736 Baumgartner and 0.657 0.696 0.696 0.645 1.564 0.803 0.169 Korzoun al. 0.790 0.740 0.740 0.756 1.600 0.791 0.165 corresponding evaporation values can be determined with Equation (1.1).

Although the issue is far from resolved, there are some indications of an accelerating hydrologic 1998; Lins and Slack, 1999). The strong linkage between the water cycle and climate is further illustrated by the estimatesofthemeanglobalsurfaceenergybudgetinTable1.4.Overlargeareasandover sufficiently long periods, when effects of unsteadiness, melt and thaw, photosynthesis and burning, and lateral advection can be neglected, this surface energy balance can be written as where is the specific flux of net incoming radiation, is the latent heat of vapor- ization, is the rate of evaporation, and is the specific flux of sensible heat into the atmosphere. The major portion of the incoming radiation is absorbed near the surface of the Earth, and it is transformed into internal energy. The subsequent partition of this internal energy into long-wave back radiation, upward thermal conduction and convec- tion of sensible heat H, and latent heat E, is one of the main processes driving the atmosphere. Table 1.4 indicates that the net energy is mainly disposed of as evaporation.

{"text": "1.4 METHODOLOGIES AND PROCEDURES This book aims primarily to describe the occurrence and the transport of water in its continuous circulation over the landsurfaces of the Earth. Before starting this task, it is worthwhile to review briefly the different strategies that are available and that can be used for this purpose."}
{"text": "1.4.1 Statistical analysis and data transformation As observed in Section 1.2, one of the main practical objectives of hydrologic analysis is the determination of the quantity of water, in storage or in transit, to be found at a given time and place, free of any direct human control. When a reliable record of observed hydrologic data is available, a great deal can be learned simply by a statistical analysis of this record. Although such an approach is proper for stationary systems in the prediction of long-term behavior for general planning purposes, it cannot be used for short-term and emergency forecasting, for example, during floods, or for day-to-day resource management decisions. Furthermore, reliable records are available for only a fewlocationsoveralimitedperiodoftime,andpracticallyneverwhereneeded.Therefore inhydrologytheproblemisoftensuch,thatamethodmustbedevisedtotransformsome available data, which are of no direct interest, to the required hydrologic information. For instance, the problem may consist of determining the rate of flow in a river at a given location either from a known flow rate at some other point upstream or downstream, or from a known rainfall distribution over the upstream river basin. In other cases, the problem may consist of deducing the basin evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation on the basis of available meteorological data."}
{"text": "1.4.2 The “physical” versus the “systems” approach The hydrologic literature is replete with attempts at classifying the methodologies and paradigms that have been used to transform hydrologic input into hydrologic output information. Until a few years ago it had become customary to consider two contrasting approaches,namelythe“physical”approachandthe“systems”approach.Inthephysical approach the input–output relationship is sought by the solution of the known conser- vation equations of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics with appropriate boundary conditions to describe the flow and transport of water throughout the hydrologic cycle. Thisapproachhasobviouslimitations;thephysiographicandgeomorphiccharacteristics ofmosthydrologicsystemsaresocomplicatedandvariable,andthedegreeofuncertainty in the boundary conditions so large, that solutions are feasible only for certain highly simplified situations. In other words, the properties of natural catchments can never be measured accurately enough, and solutions, based on internal descriptions starting from introduction first principles of fluid mechanics, can be obtained only for grossly idealized conditions, which are coarse approximations of any real situation. based on a diametrically opposite philosophy. In this approach the physical structure of the various components of the hydrologic cycle and their inner mechanisms are not considered;instead,eachcomponent,howeveritmaybedefined,isthoughtofasa“black box,” and the analysis focuses on discovering a mathematical relationship between the moisture, evaporation, etc.). The structure of this mathematical relationship is mostly quiteremotefromthephysicalstructureoftheprototypephenomenainnature.Thislack ofcorrespondencebetweentheinnerphysicalmechanismsandthepostulatedfunctional formalismsmakesthisapproachquitegeneraloperationally,becauseitpermitstheuseof well-known algorithms and objective criteria in identification and prediction. However, this also underlies the main limitations of this approach. First, in assigning cause and effect the definition of input and output variables is mostly based on intuition guided by past experience, and the danger exists that some important phenomena are overlooked. Second, the best that can ever be expected with a black box approach is a satisfactory reproduction of a previously obtained input–output record; even when such data are available, it is difficult to accommodate fully the nonstationary effects in the system, and it is impossible to anticipate subsequent hydrologic changes, such as those resulting from urbanization, deforestation, reclamation, or climate change. Because many hydrologic methods do not really fit in this physical-versus-empirical classification, a third possible approach was taken to be an intermediate one. In this view the performance of a hydrologic unit, say a catchment, is represented in terms of some idealized components or “grey boxes,” which correspond to recognizable ele- ments in the prototype, whose input–output response functions are structured after solutions of some tractable or suitably simplified situations of the physical processes perceived to be relevant. This third way was often called the “conceptual model” approach. At first sight, a classification based on three distinct approaches, namely physical, empirical and conceptual, may appear reasonable. However, it is less than obvious how this classification can be applied to specific cases. Indeed, one might ask what the dif- ference is between physical and empirical. After all, the essence of physical science is experimentation and conceptualization. Moreover, the physical approach of one dis- cipline is usually the empiricism or the conceptual model of another. For example, Newton’s “law” of viscous shear constitutes the physical basis of a wide area of fluid mechanics, whereas it represents a mere black box simplification in molecular physics. Darcy’slawisthephysicalbasisofmuchofgroundwaterhydrology,butinfluidmechan- icsitcanbeconsideredanoperationalapproach,toavoidthecomplexityofflowanalysis in an irregular and ill-defined pore network.

{"text": "1.4.3 Spatial scale and parameterization General approach All natural flow phenomena are governed by the principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, which can be expressed by a number of equations to provide a mathematical description of what goes on. However, because there are normally more dependent variables than available conservation equations, in order to close the system, additional relationships must be introduced. These closure relationships, also called parameterizations,relatesomeofthevariableswitheachothertodescribecertainspecific physical mechanisms; the mathematical form of these relationships, and the values of the material constants or are usually based on experimentation. parameters A second point is that any physical phenomenon must be considered at a given scale; this scale is the available (depending on the data) or chosen (depending on the objectives of the study) resolution. It will become clear later on in this book that, while the funda- mental conservation equations remain unaffected by the scale at which the phenomenon is being considered, most closure relationships in them are quite sensitive to scale. Indeed, a parameterization can be considered as a mathematical means of describing the subresolution (or microscale) processes of the phenomenon, in terms of resolvable scale (or macroscale) variables; these macroscale variables are the ones, which can be treated explicitly in the analysis or for which measured records are obtainable. Thus, the details of the microscale mechanisms are not considered explicitly, but their statis- tical effect is formulated mathematically by a parameterization in terms of macroscale variables. Allthissuggeststhatasoundcriteriontodistinguish,inprincipleatleast,oneapproach from another, may be the spatial scale at which the internal mechanisms are parame- terized. For example, Newton’s equation for viscous shear stress (see Equation (1.12) below)isaparameterizationintermsofvariablestypicallyatthemillimetertocentimeter scale; however, it reflects momentum exchanges at molecular scales, which are orders of magnitude smaller. The hydraulic conductivity is a parameter at the so-called Darcy scale (see Chapter 8), namely a scale somewhere intermediate between the Newtonian viscosity(orNavier–Stokes)scaleforwaterandairinsidethesoilpores,ontheonehand, and the field scales for infiltration and drainage, on the other. Several spatial scales are illustrated with the corresponding characteristic temporal scales in Figure 1.2 for some general types of water transport processes as they have been considered in hydrologic studies. On the land surfaces of the Earth, the catchment or river basin sizes appear as scales of central importance.

In meteorology, the concern is more on atmospheric motions and weather systems, and this has led to a somewhat different scale classification; an example of a commonly used classification is shown in Table 1.5.

Rather, it is more useful to determine what scales are appropriate for the available and measurable data, and for the problem at hand. In other words, what is the appropriate level of parameterization? Spatial variability and effective parameters As mentioned above, a parameterization can be defined as a functional relationship between the variables describing the phenomenon in question. This relationship invari- ably contains one or more constant terms, reflecting material and fluid properties and vegetational, geomorphic, geologic and other physiographic features; these are called parameters and they are normally determined by experiment. Most hydrologic parame- terstendtobehighlyvariableinspace.Itstandstoreason,therefore,thattheexperimental determination of any such space-dependent parameter must be carried out at the scale at which it is to be applied to describe the flow. A second important issue is that any given parameterization is usually valid only over a certain finite range of spatial scales, and that the computational scale, that is the integration domain or the discretization of the equations, must lie within that range. Because the necessary data may be available only at a coarser resolution, in practical application a parameterization may have to be applied at scales, for which it was not intended originally and which are larger than permissible. This means in such a case that the spatial variability of the parameters at the finer scales, which is normally present in the natural environment, cannot be accounted for with the available data. This difficulty is often resolved by assuming that the parameterization is still valid at the larger scale, and that it can be implemented with averaged or values of the parameters. effective This approach is not always satisfactory, and it is still the subject of intense research. Some aspects of this issue related to land surface–atmosphere interactions are discussed elsewhere (Brutsaert, 1998). Requirements Tobeuseful,aparameterizationmustsatisfyseveralrequirements.First,aparameteriza- tionmustbevalid,thatis,itmustbeabletogiveafaithfuldescriptionofthephenomenon in question.

Whenever the density of the substance in question can be considered constant, the continuity equation assumes its well-known form Note that the continuity equation is not usually derived this way; the present derivation is used to maintain unity and consistency of treatment with the conservation of momentum in Section 1.5.3; moreover, it is relevant to the study of deforming porous media later on in Chapter 8. A more common way to derive the continuity equation consists of setting up a mass balance for a certain volume fixed in space, also called a volume. The mass balance states that the sum of all the inflow rates into the control volume minus the sum of all the outflow rates is equal to the time rate of change of mass stored in the control vol- ume. For an infinitesimally small control volume this procedure also yields Equation (1.8). conservation laws: the equations of motion Regardless of the derivation, however, it should be remembered that Equations (1.8) and should allow the determination of the distribution of the amount and transport of water in space and in time.

{"text": "2.1.1 Global features Theglobalamountofwatervaporcontainedintheairisroughly(seeTable1.3)equivalent with a layer of liquid water covering the earth, with a thickness of around 25 mm on average. The thickness of this layer, which is the total liquid equivalent of water vapor in the atmospheric column at a given location, is also called the water, . precipitable W However, this quantity of water vapor is not distributed uniformly and it can greatly vary over a wide range of scales in space and in time. For instance, the water vapor content of the atmosphere, just like the temperature, generally tends to decrease with increasing latitude. Available data (Randel al., 1996) show that the precipitable water is more likely to be well below 5 mm near the Poles, and close to 50 mm near the Equator. But this is not always the case; even at similar latitudes there can be huge regional variations, the most extreme example being the warm dry deserts of the world. Most of the atmospheric water vapor is found relatively close to the ground, and at any given location water vapor decreases sharply with height; typically, about half the total water vapor in the atmospheric column can be found below a height of 1 or 2 km. Because the global annual evaporation is around 1 m, the average atmospheric residence time of water vapor is only about 9 days. This time scale governs the hydrologic interactions and water transfers between the atmosphere and the other two compartments of the global system, the oceans and the continents. This time scale is especially fundamental to the transport of atmospheric water vapor from its source regions–mainlyevaporationfromtheoceans–tosinksinprecipitatingweathersystems. Indeed, the excess precipitation on the continents, which does not evaporate, ultimately runsofftotheseasandoceansoftheworld.Abalanceismaintainedintheglobalsystem by the fact that over the oceans the situation is reversed and that evaporation is generally larger than precipitation, allowing the excess oceanic water vapor to be transported back water aloft to the continents. This transport of water from the oceans to the land areas, also called advection, takes place mostly in the form of water vapor and not as clouds; actually, in the atmosphere the total amount of water in the liquid and ice phases is less than 0.5% of the water in the vapor phase. But beside its central role in the hydrologic cycle, water vapor strongly affects other aspects of the Earth’s weather and climate as well. It is one of the main agents in the overall energy budget of the atmosphere in a number of ways. Globally, as seen in Table 1.4, the phase changes from liquid and solid to vapor are the main energy transfer mechanisms from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere; the subsequent condensation of this vapor in the air furnishes a large portion of the energy needed for the circula- tion of the atmosphere. Thus, the large-scale transport of water vapor as latent heat is one of the main redistribution mechanisms for the uneven radiative input from the Sun. In addition, the concentration and spatial distribution of the atmospheric water vapor are major factors controlling the amount and type of cloud, which in turn determine the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Finally, as the most abundant greenhouse gas, water vapor absorbs and thus “traps” terrestrial infrared radiative energy, and then re-emits it at a lower temperature."}

Two cases are of interest, depending on the degree of saturation of the air."}

(cid:5) (cid:5) Whenever the actual lapse rate in the atmosphere is larger than , a particle undergoing a small upward displacement and changing its temperature according to Equation (2.22), will be warmer and therefore lighter than its surroundings; this means that it will have a tendency to continue its upward motion (see Figure 2.2). By the same token, a particle undergoing a small downward displacement under the same lapse rate conditions, will be colder and thus heavier than the surrounding air; again, it will have a tendency to continue its downward movement. In both situations, once displaced however slightly, air parcels tend to continue their motion and amplify their displacements both upward and downward: under such lapse rate conditions the (cid:5) < (cid:5) atmosphere is unstable. Conversely, in an atmosphere with , the upward-moving parcel, whose temperature change is given by Equation (2.22), becomes surrounded by air that is relatively warmer (see Figure 2.3); thus it is heavier and it will tend to return to its original position, where it was in equilibrium with its surroundings. In this case, the parcelresistsbeingmovedawayfromitsoriginalpositionandverticaldisplacementsare suppressed: the atmosphere is said to be stable. Under conditions when the actual lapse rate in the air is dry adiabatic, the atmospheric stability is neutral. In summary, one has for unsaturated air the following criteria: (cid:5) > (cid:5) unstable (cid:5) = (cid:5) (cid:5) < (cid:5) hydrostatics and atmospheric stability Fig.2.3 Stableatmosphereinwhich thetemperaturedecrease withelevation(solidline)is smallerthanthedry adiabaticlapserate(dashed line),sothatΓ Γ PARTICLE Temperature,T Unstable conditions typically occur whenever the atmosphere is being heated by the surface below, for example, as a result of solar radiation on days with clear sky, or as relatively cold air moves over a relatively warmer surface, such as a lake or the ocean in fall and early winter. An unstable atmosphere is subject to more intense mixing and turbulencethananeutralone;thisalsoresultsinlargerturbulenttransport.Undercertain conditions an unstable atmosphere will even give rise to various types of organized motions, with scales ranging from mere local updrafts and dust devils to large tropical storms. The atmosphere is often stable when the air is being cooled from below. This typically occurs at night under clear skies, when the surface is cooled by outgoing long- wave radiation or when relatively warm air flows over a relatively colder lake or ocean surface in spring. In addition, stable conditions, also called inversions, may result from larger-scaleweatherpatterns,whenrelativelywarmerairmassesmoveovercolderlayers. Not surprisingly, stable conditions have the opposite effect of unstable conditions. Thus mixing and turbulence are suppressed, and atmospheric transport is normally smaller. Under extreme conditions, the turbulence may be eliminated altogether and the flow of the air may be laminar. Such conditions are sometimes visible in the evening of a calm sunny day, around sunset, when the air near the ground becomes chilly and the smoke from a chimney can be seen moving slowly through the tree tops of a forest. On a somewhat larger scale, as a result of the reduced turbulence and dispersion, inversion conditions also tend to aggravate pollution problems in populated areas. Potential temperature To repeat briefly, during small displacements, parcels of air undergo adiabatic tempera- ture changes in accordance with Equation (2.22). In a perfectly neutral atmosphere the lapse rate of the atmosphere is also ; therefore under such conditions a displaced parcelwill,onaverageatleast,alwaysbesurroundedbyairatthesametemperatureand, as a result, there is no net exchange of heat. This means that even though there is a verti- cal temperature difference under neutral conditions, the heat flux is zero; consequently, water aloft the temperature used in heat transfer formulations should be corrected to account for that fact. This can be done by using the potential temperature instead of the actual temperatureT. The potential temperature is the temperature that would result if air were brought adiabatically to a standard pressure level 1000 hPa; for such a process yield Poisson’s equation θ = /p)Rd T(p (2.23) which can serve to define the potential temperature and also to calculate it for a given pressure and temperature T; note that in Equation (2.23) is replaced by for convenience. During an adiabatic process the potential temperature is conserved and therefore under perfectly neutral conditions in a dry atmosphere, or when the specific humidity is constant with height, the potential temperature should be a constant. A dry atmosphere is unstable when decreases, and stable when it increases with height. Nev- ertheless, the difference between and is usually rather small, especially in the lower layers of the air near the ground surface, where most measurements are made. Therefore in many situations, when the height difference of the temperature measurements is only a few meters, the use of the actual temperature is allowed; otherwise must be used in heat transfer formulations. Density stratification due to water vapor Intheaboveconsiderationsofatmosphericstability,thedensitystratificationduetovertical humidity gradient was not taken into account. Under some conditions this can be an maybeincorporatedintheanalysisbymeansofthevirtualpotentialtemperature,definedas in the same way the virtual temperature is related to the actual temperature, as indicated in Equation (2.10). Thus, strictly speaking, in the presence of humidity stratification, the atmosphere can be considered statically neutral, not when is constant, but only when is constant; it is unstable when decreases, and stable when it increases with height. Putdifferently,undersuchconditionsthestabilitycriterionforanatmosphereisnotthelapse rate of the temperature, but the lapse rate of the virtual temperature; in practice, however, this difference is often ignored."}

However, under most conditions the heat loss by the removal of this condensed water is fairly negligible, and the saturated adiabatic lapse rate is a satisfactory approximation. Thus, for saturated air, one has the following stability criteria: (cid:5) > (cid:5) unstable (cid:5) = (cid:5) (cid:5) < (cid:5)"}
{"text": "2.2.3 Conditional instability It often happens that the actual lapse rate in the atmosphere is intermediate between the dry and the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, that is ; this case is referred to as conditional instability. When a partly saturated parcel of air is raised in such an atmo- sphere, it will initially change its temperature at the dry adiabatic rate in accordance with Equation (2.8), and thus remain colder than the surroundings (see Figure 2.4). water aloft This situation is still stable. However, if the particle is made to rise further, and con- tinues to cool down, it may reach the level , where condensation takes place; above the condensation level it will change its temperature at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. If the rise continues, eventually above the levelz the temperature of the particle will exceed that of the surroundings; the rising air is now lighter than its surroundings, and an unstable situation has been established. The air, which was originally forced to rise, will now take off by free convection and continue to rise without any outside agent. The height is the free convection level. Thus whether or not a vertical displacement results in instability depends largely on the moisture content of the atmosphere. In a moist atmosphere the condensation level is low, and relatively small vertical displace- ments readily produce unstable conditions. In a dry atmosphere, the level is higher, and the atmosphere is more likely to remain stable, even with relatively large vertical displacements."}

In a turbulent flow molecular diffusion can usually be neglected, and water vapor is moved from one place to another by advective transport, that is, by being linked to the motions of the air that contains it. One exception, when molecular diffusion may be of some consequence, occurs near a wall where the no slip condition reduces the velocity of the moving air to zero and the turbulence is largely suppressed.

However, this usage may lead to some confusion because, especially in the atmospheric sciences, convection is commonly reserved to describe transportinvolvinggravityeffects,resultingfromunstabledensitystratification.Toavoid such confusion in this regard, in this book any transport that is linked to the motion of the fluid is called advection. Turbulent flux of water vapor In turbulent flow the detailed description of the velocity field and also the temperature, the content of water vapor, or other admixtures of the air, at any given point in time and space, is practically impossible and it can only be accomplished in a statistical sense. The simplest and probably most important statistic is the mean. Accordingly, ever since Reynolds introduced the idea, it has been common practice in the analysis of turbulent flow phenomena to decompose the relevant variables into a mean and a turbulent fluctuation, namely etc. F F F u u q q turbulent transport of water vapor After applying the customary time averaging over a suitable time period, one obtains from Equation (2.25) for the mean flux components of water vapor u(cid:5)q(cid:5)) The first terms on the right of these three equations represent the advective transport of water vapor by the mean motion of the air. The second terms are the components of the advectivevaportransportbytheturbulence;theyarealsooftencalledtheReynoldsfluxes, and statistically speaking, they are covariances. The estimation and parameterization of these flux components is one of the core problems of hydrology. Conservation equation of water vapor The standard procedure for a more thorough analysis of the water vapor transport consists of combining the expressions for the fluxes, Equations (2.26), with the principle of mass conservation(1.8)appliedtowatervapor.Thisisaccomplishedbysubstitutingρ forρ canbeassumedtohaveaconstantdensity,whichallowsuseofEquation(1.9)forthemean velocity v. Thus, one obtains the conservation equation for the mean specific humidity, (see Brutsaert, 1982), as follows (cid:7) (cid:8) u(cid:5)q(cid:5) in which, it should be noted again, the molecular diffusion term is neglected. In princi- ple, it should be possible to solve Equation (2.27) with appropriate boundary conditions to describe water vapor transport in the atmosphere. However, this equation presents several difficulties, which make its solution extremely difficult. First, since the fluxes in (2.26) are intrinsically dependent on the velocity of the air and the turbulence, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the flow and to include the conservation equations for momen- tum and temperature in the solution process as well. A second and more fundamental difficulty is that this conservation equation for the mean specific humidity contains not q(cid:5) only as a dependent variable, which is the first moment, but also the covariances of with the velocity fluctuations and which are second moments. This means that Equation(2.27)hasmorethanoneunknown;thisfactisaninstanceofthenotoriousclosure problem of turbulence and it indicates that, without additional relationships, this equation cannot be solved mathematically. Fortunately, it is possible to simplify the general problem, as formulated with the above fluxes, considerably and still obtain meaningful results. This is accomplished, first, by assuming that the atmosphere nearest the surface can be considered as a steady boundary layer above a quasi-homogeneous surface (Section 2.4), and, second, by the application of similarity assumptions to alleviate the turbulence closure problem by appropriate parameterization (Section 2.5). water aloft"}

Accordingly, the horizontal scales of most atmospheric flow phenomena of interest in hydrology are much larger than the vertical, so that the horizontal gradients are usually small compared to the vertical gradients, and the vertical velocities are small relative to the horizontal velocities. Thus, many problems can be solved by simply assuming that (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 and 0 (2.28) In addition, since is the direction of the mean wind velocity near the ground, the mean y-directioncanalsobediscarded,orv = velocityinthelateral 0.Strictlyspeaking(2.28) is valid only when the surface is perfectly homogeneous or uniform. Such conditions are rare, and the properties of most natural landsurfaces are spatially quite variable; fortunately,inmanysituationsofinteresttheycanbeconsideredtobeatleaststatistically be used to describe the flow. More generally (2.28) is tantamount to assuming that, as the air moves parallel to a homogeneous surface, on average (in the turbulence sense) the concentration of any property or admixture advected by the air changes only in the vertical and remains constant in the horizontal direction. The fact that the mean concentrations change only vertically is evidence that there is a source or a sink of the admixture at the surface, and thus the only turbulent fluxes of consequence are the vertical components. In the case of humidity with mean concentration (per unit mass of bulk air) q, Equations (2.26) are thus effectively reduced to = ρ w(cid:5)q(cid:5) in which henceforth the overbar on is omitted for convenience of notation. While mathematically Equations (2.26) and (2.29) are unambiguous, a more intu- itive sense of their physical significance can be obtained by considering the mechanism sketched in Figure 2.5. A particle of air, which undergoes a vertical velocity fluctuation w(cid:5), w(cid:5)δt travels a distance during a time interval After that air parcel has risen a w(cid:5)δt small distance from a level, where the mean specific humidity is q, it has a specific humidity which is larger than the mean of its new environment; thus the rate (distance per unit time) at which this particular parcel transports absolute humidity upward is (cid:5)w(cid:5)) times its volume. There are many such parcels – or eddies – in turbulent flow the atmospheric boundary layer Fig.2.5 Sketchillustratingasmallfluid parcel,whichrisesasmalldistance w(cid:3)δt,toalevel,wherethemean humidityq islowerbyanamount q(cid:3) thanatitsoriginalposition. Mean specific humidity, q moving in all directions and the transport rate by all of them, i.e. the vertical transport of water vapor mass per unit horizontal area and per unit time is on average as indicated in Equation (2.29). Similar expressions can be written for the fluxes of other properties or admixtures of theflow.Theverticalfluxcomponentofhorizontalmomentum,withmeanconcentration = ρw(cid:5)u(cid:5) and that of sensible heat, with mean concentration can be written as = ρc w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) Under steady conditions in the lowest few meters of the air above a uniform surface, on account of continuity the inflow rate equals the outflow rate, which means that these vertical fluxes must be constant with elevation.

In the atmosphere, under conditions not very different from neutral, the outer region is affected both by the pressure gradients, reflecting larger scale weather patterns, and by the Coriolis forces, reflecting the effect of the rotation of the Earth. Under unstable conditions, the effects of the pressure and Coriolis forces are relatively small, and the outer region is more characterized by thermal convective turbulence; the outer region may then be referred to as the or the layer. The upper limit mixed layer convection of the unstable boundary layer is typically indicated by a sharp inversion, that is, a layer of stable air. Over land, the thickness of the boundary layer tends to vary in the course of the day. Consider for instance a typical evolution at mid-latitudes, in the absence of rapidly changing weather with passing fronts or precipitation activity. As stable conditions develop during the night, the boundary layer may range from a few tens of meters in the evening to about 500 m by early morning; then after sunrise, a new unstable boundary layer develops which may eventually reach a thickness of 1–2 km at full maturity by the middle of the day. This evolution is sketched in Figure 2.7. Figure 2.8 shows an example of the evolution of the temperature profile in the course of a sunny day. As a rule of thumb, the thickness of a typical boundary layer can be assumed to be of the order of 1 km; it is usually larger under unstable than under neutral conditions. The thickness of the atmospheric surface layer (or ASL) is usually taken as the lower one tenth of the boundary layer.

(see below), it coincides approximately with the region where the direction of the wind remains constant with height; this absence of “turning” confirms that it is indeed the region where the effect of the rotation of the Earth is of little consequence. The surface sublayer is also sometimes assumed to be the layer where the vertical turbulent fluxes do not change appreciably from their value at the surface, say less than 10%. Although the ASL occupies the lower part of the turbulent boundary layer, it does not extend all the way down to the surface. As illustrated in Figure 2.6, the height of the lower limit of the ASL can be assumed to be of the order of in the case of smooth flow, and of the order of 3 to 5h in the case of rough flow; is the characteristic height of the roughness obstacles. In general, under non-neutral conditions the air flow and the momentum transport are greatly affected by the transport of sensible heat and, to a lesser extent, water vapor, and vice versa. However, in the lower part of the atmospheric surface layer it is found that sensible heat and water vapor may be considered as merely passive admixtures, and that the effects of the density stratification resulting from temperature and humidity gradients are negligible. This lower region of the atmospheric surface layer is referred turbulence similarity to as the sublayer. Under neutral conditions, the whole surface layer behaves as a dynamic layer.

{"text": "2.5 TURBULENCE SIMILARITY Over the past century or so, various turbulence closure schemes have been proposed, essentially by invoking similarity on the basis of dimensional analysis. In this type of approach, after the relevant physical quantities are identified, either from the governing equations or simply by inspection, they are organized into a reduced number of dimen- sionless quantities. Dimensional analysis only establishes the possible existence of a functional relationship between these dimensionless quantities, and it is incapable of providing the specific form of the functional relationship; the form of that function must usuallybedeterminedbyexperimentoronthebasisofsomeconceptualtransportmodel or other theoretical considerations.

Note that water aloft the four heights in Equation (2.33) need not all be different; thus levels 4 and 3 could be the same as 2 and 1, respectively. In the case of the vertical momentum flux, one obtains in the same way where Cd is the transfer coefficient for momentum, also called the drag coefficient; in the case of the vertical sensible heat flux, one has similarly ) (2.35) where Ch is the heat transfer coefficient, also called the Stanton number. In many applications the lowest reference level of the wind speed is taken at the surface where 0.

{"text": "2.5.2 Some specific implementations: flux-profile functions The dimensionless transfer coefficients Ce, Cd and Ch, and their dependence on other dimensionless variables, have been the subject of much research. Major progress was made in the thirties by means of mixing length theory, as a result of contributions by Prandtl, von Karman, and Taylor in the framework of the turbulent diffusion approach; this led initially to the formulation of the logarithmic profile equations for the mean wind speed, the potential temperature, the specific humidity and other admixtures of further developments by Monin and Obukhov and others. In this section a few similarity approaches are reviewed that have been useful in the practical estimation of surface turbulence similarity Neutral atmospheric surface layer Itisnowgenerallyagreed,andalmostacceptedbydefinition,thatinthedynamicsublayer, and under neutral conditions in the whole atmospheric surface layer, the concentration of any admixture of the flow is a logarithmic function of height above the ground.

Thus, the mean velocity gradient in a fluid of density, is determined by the shear stress at the displacement height is introduced to account for the uncertainty of the position of the wall in the case of irregular and uneven surfaces.

However, in the absence of measure- ments, it may be necessary to estimate them from simple geometric characteristics of the surface; numerous such relationships have appeared in the literature (e.g. Brutsaert, 1982). Wieringa (1993) has presented a review of available experimental determinations of over homogeneous terrain. A few typical values of taken from the literature for various surfaces are given in Table 2.6. As a useful first approximation for surfaces water aloft with densely placed obstacles such as natural vegetation with average height , the momentum roughness can be assumed to be of the order of of the order of /2 /3, /100 to 2h and and of the order of or smaller.

Therefore, it is practicallyalwaysnecessarytoincludetheeffectofthestability,i.e.thedensitystratification, of the atmosphere in the formulation of the profile equations and of the corresponding transfer coefficients. One of the more common ways of doing this is based on the Monin– Obukhov (1954) approach, which assumes that the effect of the density stratification of the flow can be represented by the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy, resulting from the work of the buoyancy forces; it can be shown (see Monin and Yaglom, 1971; Brutsaert, 1982) that near the ground this rate is given by in common. Accordingly one can hypothesize that in a stratified turbulent flow any dimensionless characteristic of the turbulence depend only on the following: the height and the turbulent energy production rate by the buoyancy. These four quantities, which can be expressed in terms of three basic dimensions, viz. time, length and air mass, can be combined into one dimensionless variable. This variable, which was proposed by Monin and Obukhov (1954) (originally for 0), is where is known as the Obukhov stability length, defined by in which is a mean reference temperature (in K) of the air near the ground and the subscript 0 refers to near-surface values of the fluxes, so that by definition these fluxes represent and respectively. In the original formulation of the turbulent water vapor flux term did not appear; although in many cases the effect of the water vapor on the density stratification can be neglected, it is still is advisable to include it whenever possible. With this hypothesis the dimensionless gradients of the mean wind, of the temperature and of the humidity, can be written as − = φ (ζ) w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) − = φ (ζ) w(cid:5)q(cid:5) turbulence similarity in which the subscripts m, h and v refer to momentum, sensible heat and water vapor, respectively.

Numerous attempts have also been made to formulate similarity turbulence similarity Fig.2.14 Integralformof theflux-profile functionsfor momentumΨ m(ζ) andforsensible h(ζ)under unstable conditions,asgiven byEquations (2.63)and(2.64). 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 − ζ = − − hypothesesfortheentireboundarylayer.Inthisapproach,thesurfacefluxesarecommonly relatedto“bulk”variables,namelyvaluesofthevariablesatthetopandbottomoftheABL, or their averages over all or part of the ABL. The basic form of the equations is essentially aloft above the surface layer. Ideas on the application of similarity to the entire ABL, including the outer region were put forth early on by Rossby and Montgomery (1935) and Lettau (1959), and subsequent developments can be traced through the work of Kazanski (2000), among others. The various versions of this approach can be written in a general form as follows, w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) θ −θ = −d )/z s b b 0 0h where and arefunctionsofanumberofdimensionlessvariablesthataffecttransport intheouterregionandwherethesubscriptbindicatesbulkorcharacteristicscalevariablesof theABL.Thush denotesacharacteristicthicknessorheightscaleoftheABL;thevariables and arecharacteristichorizontalwindvelocitycomponentsinthex-andy-directions, respectively (x is the direction of the near-surface wind; because it may involve the Earth’s rotation,usually pointstotheleftof intheNorthernHemisphere,andtotherightinthe Southern Hemisphere), such that , in which is a characteristic wind speed aloft. These bulk variables have been given different definitions in the past, depending on the specific implementation of the approach.

The more recent implementations (see, for example, Brutsaert, 1999) have been mostly for unstable conditions with mean values of the variables in the mixed layer, and with the wind speed as a scalar. The rationale for this choice of bulk variables is that, indeed, as illustrated in Figure 2.15, owing to convection with vertical mixing the y-component of the velocity is nearly negligible, so that the x-component is practically equal to the wind speed; moreover, wind speed measurements aloft can be noisy, so that a height-averaged value is likely to be more robust. Figure 2.16 shows the corresponding temperature profile. Thus, with this choice of variables, the formulation for momentum and sensible heat can be written as V ] (2.67) m i 0 0 w w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) [ln((h (2.68) s m i 0 0h inwhich and arethemeanwindspeedandpotentialtemperature,respectively,inthe mixed layer of the unstable ABL; is the height of the top of the mixed layer, that is the bottom of the inversion above the ground, and has been given a subscript w to indicate that the wind speed is used, instead of the wind velocity components and turbulence similarity Fig.2.16 Exampleoftheprofileofpotentialtemperaturemeasuredwiththesameradiosondeasthatof thewindshowninFigure2.15.Thesolidcircleshowsthemedianvalueofthesurface temperature.Thearrowindicatestheheightoftheinversion.(FromBrutsaertandSugita, Untilnow,nogeneraldefinitiveformhasbeenderivedforthesefunctions and C.An exampleofaformulationforunstableconditions,thathasproducedgoodresults(Brutsaert, 1999), is summarized in what follows. It is based on the assumption of an ABL consisting and above it a mixed layer as a slab with uniform profiles; it is further also based on the assumption explained behind (2.64) regarding the position of the top of the surface layer, where it meets the mixed layer. For moderately rough terrain, i.e. when )h , the resulting functions are w t m t i 0 m 0 t h t i 0 h 0h For very rough terrain, when )h , the functions are ln((h (z w i 0 t 0 m t 0 m 0 ln((h (z i 0 t 0 h t 0 h 0h Thesimilarityfunctions and givenbyEquations(2.69)and(2.70)areillustratedin Figures 2.17 and 2.18. In the derivation of Equations (2.69) and (2.70) it was assumed that the outer region is a perfectly mixed slab layer; this assumption has its limitations. In fact, water aloft 0 100 200 300 400 –(h – d )/L Fig.2.17 Dependenceofthebulksimilarityfunction thelattervaluesareshownasnumbersatthecorrespondingcurves.Thecurvesfor [(hi [(hi areobtainedwithEquation (2.69),andthosefor (2.70);itisassumedthatα = 0.12and β = areobtainedwithEquation 120. under unstable conditions the potential temperature often tends to increase slightly with elevation,roughlyfromaboutthemiddleofthemixedlayer(e.g.Figures2.8and2.16);this is mostly the result of entrainment of warmer air into the ABL from above. Similarly the wind speed is often affected by this entrainment. Therefore, in the practical application oftheseequations,itmaybeadvisabletoobtainthemeanwindandtemperaturedifference from measurements over the lower half of the mixed layer, that is below (h in order to minimize any possible entrainment effects. The temperature difference term in Equation (2.68) has the lower value at the surface. As in (2.51), the lower value can also be taken at some level in the surface layer; the proper formulation for this case can be obtained by simply subtracting (2.55) from (2.66) or (2.68), so that is eliminated. As a further alternative, an example of the application of the bulk ABL similarity approach with the lower value not at the surface, but at shelter level, has been presented by Qualls (1993). The bulk ABL similarity approach (also called BAS), as formulated here for unstable conditions, has several features which make it attractive to obtain surface fluxes and from soundings in the upper reaches of the boundary layer. First, the mixed layer variables and , which are averages over the mixed layer, are more robust than the profiles u(z) and such profiles often tend to be erratic and noisy. Second, since these mixed layer variables are averages over a layer extending roughly between heights of the order of 100 m and 1 km above the ground, they reflect mean surface conditions over upwind distances of the order of 1–10 km; this provides the main justification and appeal of this approach to describe surface fluxes at the mesogamma scale (see Table 1.5), which is often the relevant spatial scale for hydrologic catchments.

{"text": "2.6 SURFACE BOUNDARY CONDITION: THE ENERGY BUDGET CONSTRAINT TheturbulentfluxesofwatervaporandsensibleheatneartheEarth–atmosphereinterface are linked not only by similarity relationships in the turbulent air, but also by the energy budget. Indeed, both evaporation E, as a latent heat flux, and the related sensible heat flux require the supply of some other form of energy. Therefore their magnitudes are constrained by this available energy. The question can be treated quantitatively by considering the energy budget for a layer of surface material. Depending on the nature of the surface, this layer may consist of water, or of some other substrate like soil, plant canopy or snow; although this layer can be taken to be infinitesimally thin, it may water aloft 12 18 00 06 12 18 00 06 12 18 24 Time (PST) Fig.2.19 coveredsurfaceatDavis,California,onJune,2–4,1965.Thebalanceequationwasassumedtobe = + +G.Theevaporationwasmeasuredwithaweighinglysimeter(PruittandAngus, Rn LeE H 1960)andthesurfaceshearstresswithafloatingdragplatelysimeter(Goddard, 1970).Thedataare drawnfromBrooksandPruitt(1966);theroughnessofthegrassysurfacewasestimatedtobe 0.97±0.14cm(Morganetal.1971). sometimes even comprise a lake or a vegetational canopy over its entire depth. For many practical purposes, the energy budget equation can be written as R L E H L F G A n e p p h surface boundary condition In words, Equation (2.72) states that the difference between incoming and outgoing energy fluxes is equal to the rate of increase of the energy stored in the layer under consideration; the sign convention is such that the energy fluxes toward the layer are taken as positive and those away from it as negative. In (2.72) the quantity is the net radiativefluxdensityattheuppersurfaceofthelayer, isthelatentheatofvaporization, is the thermal conversion factor for fixation of carbon dioxide, is the specific flux of CO , is the specific energy flux leaving the layer at the lower boundary, is the energyadvectionintothelayerexpressedasspecificflux,and∂W/∂t istherateofenergy storage per unit horizontal area in the layer; in the case of an ice or snow layer this last term may include the energy consumed by fusion, and may have to be replaced by , the heat of sublimation. At present in the SI system all these surface energy fluxes are commonly expressed in units of W Example 2.1. Some features of the surface energy budget The order of magnitude and the diurnal variation of the main terms in the energy budget for different surfaces are illustrated in Figures 2.19–2.22. Figure 2.19 shows the terms in an irrigated environment under clear sky in the summer. Figure 2.20a illustrates the response of the turbulent heat fluxes in response to varying cloudiness in the course of a spring day, whereas Figure 2.20b shows a typical clear sky situation, which is generally similar to Figure 2.19. In contrast to what happens over land, Figure 2.21 shows how over deep water the turbulent heat fluxes and do not follow the diurnal cycle of the solar radiative energy supply; as a result of the large heat capacity of the water body, the surface temperature tends to remain more constant, and less affected by the radiative energy input. Figure 2.22 illustrates the gradual evolution of the three main terms of the energy budget in natural prairie during a period of prolonged drying in the fall season duringtheFirstISLSCPFieldExperiment.Asthesoilmoisturecontentisdecreasingthe evaporation rate exhibits a steady decrease. On the other hand, the sensible heat flux is not increasing in the same steady way, as one might expect if the available energy were constant; it is more erratic and is more responsive to the vagaries of the weather while the radiation is steadily declining as winter approaches."}

In the event that suitable data are not available, it may be necessary to make an estimate by means of one of several theoretical models or simpler empirical formulae that relate short-wave radiation with other physical factors, such as extraterrestrial radiation, optical air mass, turbidity, water vapor content of the air, amount and type of cloud cover. However, these should be used with caution. A simple equation which can be used for daily averages, was proposed by Prescott (1940) in terms of daily total extraterrestrial radiation as follows [a (2.74) where and are constants which depend on the location, the season and the state of the atmosphere; their values have been determined for many locations and on average they appear to be around 0.25 and 0.50. In Equation (2.74) is the actual number of hours of bright sunshine and the number of daylight hours; as a first approximation for steady weather conditions can be related to the mean fractional cloud cover by a(n/N)+bm = 1 (2.75) in which and are different constants, for which values averaging around 1.1 and 0.85, respectively, have been observed in the Netherlands and in Japan (e.g. De Vries, 1955; Kondo, 1967). Manyotherregressionequationslike(2.74),alsoforinstantaneousvalues ,havebeen proposed in the literature, but such simple equations can be only poor substitutes for direct measurements. Nevertheless, it is possible to obtain fairly accurate radiation estimates by betterempiricalandpartlytheoreticalmethods,whichare,however,moredifficulttoapply. Examples of such methods, which can give useful results, are those presented by among Becausesuchapproachesoftenrelyontheextraterrestrialradiation,itisappropriatetotake a quick look at it. Extraterrestrial radiation The extraterrestrial radiation can readily be calculated for a given latitude, time of day and day of the year from the solar constant. For a horizontal surface, instantaneous values can be calculated from = /d )2cosβ (d (2.76) se so so s in which is the zenith angle, that is the angular distance between the sun and the vertical, and in which and are the instantaneous distance and the annual mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, respectively; however, and differ by at most 3.5%, so that this effect is often neglected in hydrologic applications. It can be readily shown that the zenith angle can be calculated as follows cosβ = cosφcoshcosδ +sinφsinδ where is the latitude and is the hour angle, such that its origin 0 is local noon or 1200, and 24 h The angle is the solar declination, that is the angular distance of the Sun north (or south when negative) of the Equator.

The declination is usually determined as a function of day of the year (see Paltridge and Platt, 1976; Liou, 2002). Figure 2.23 gives an idea of the variability of thedailytotalsofsolarradiation ;theEarthisclosesttotheSuninthemonthofJanuary, so that the curves are somewhat asymmetric between North and South, with the maximal radiation occurring in the South. Surface albedo This is the ratio of the global short-wave reflected radiative flux and the flux of the corresponding incident radiation; in contrast to the term reflectivity, the albedo also includes the diffuse portion of the radiation. In energy budget studies the albedo usually refers to an integral value over all wave lengths; however, sometimes, to distinguish it from the spectral albedo, it is called the integral albedo. In the case of an ideal rough surface, the albedo should be independent of the direction of the primary beam. For most natural surfaces the fraction of directly and diffusely reflected radiation depends on the direction of the incoming beam. Therefore, on days with sunshine, the albedo of most surfaces depends on the altitude of the Sun, but this dependence decreases with increasing cloudiness. For example, for water surfaces it appears that the albedo can be represented well by a power function of the solar altitude (see Anderson, 1954; Payne, 1972). The albedos of other surfaces obey similar relationships. However, for daily totals it is common practice to use a mean value of the albedo. Table 2.7 presents a brief summary of mean albedo values for various surfaces obtained from summaries Budyko, 1974) Long-wave or terrestrial radiation Also sometimes called nocturnal radiation, this is the radiant flux resulting from the emission of the atmospheric gases and the land and water surfaces of the Earth. All materials on Earth and around it have a much lower temperature than the Sun, so that the radiation they emit has much longer wavelengths than the global radiation. There is practically no overlap, since most of the radiation emitted by the Earth is contained in the range from 4 to 100 Long-wave radiation can be measured, but the needed measurements for a particular area of interest are rarely available, so that it must often be calculated from other measurements. It is convenient to consider two components of the terrestrial radiation at the Earth’s surface separately, namely a component of upward radiation from the surface , and that of downward radiation from the atmosphere . The upward component is usually obtained by assuming that the ground, the canopy orthewatersurfaceunderconsiderationisequivalentwithaninfinitelydeepgreybodyof uniform temperature and emissivity which is close to unity.

Moreover, since is rarely known, for daily or longer averages over land, Equation (2.79) is often applied by using the air temperature instead of the surface temperature . The downward long-wave radiation can be calculated accurately on the basis of vertical profile data of humidity and temperature. Such data are not always available wherethelong-waveradiationisneeded;asaresultsimplermethodshavebeendeveloped that rely on readily available measurements, such as air temperature and humidity near the ground. For clear sky conditions, they are mostly based on an equation of the type surface boundary condition Fig.2.24 Comparisonbetween measuredlongwave radiation under clearskyandradiation estimatedbymeans ofEquations(2.80)and (2.81)withtheoriginal = 1.24and constantsa = 1/7.(FromSugita andBrutsaert,1993.) where is the air temperature near the ground, usually taken at shelter level, and is the atmospheric emissivity under clear skies. Several expressions have been proposed for this emissivity. Most of these are strictly empirical, but it is also possible to derive from physical considerations. In one such derivation (Brutsaert, 1975; 1982), the equation for radiative transfer in a plane stratified atmosphere is solved by assuming first, a simple power function slab emissivity, and second, a near-Standard Atmosphere to obtain the temperature and humidity profiles. With typical average values of the parameters, the resulting atmospheric emissivity can be written as a(e (2.81) = = 1/7, where and are constants; these were derived to be 1.24 and when the vapor pressure of the air is in hPa mb) and is in K.

{"text": "2.6.2 The energy flux at the lower boundary of the layer The nature of and the optimal method of its determination depend on the type of substrate layer to which the energy budget equation is applied. For a thin layer of soil, for a vegetational canopy or for a whole lake or stream, the term in Equation (2.72) represents the heat flux into the ground. For a water surface, is the heat flux into the underlying water body. Over land covered with vegetation the daily mean value of G, that is the ground heat flux, is often one or more orders of magnitude smaller than the major terms in the energy budget, and E. The main reason for this is that positive daytime values of (warming) often tend to be compensated by negative nighttime values (cooling). Therefore, in design calculations, the daily values of are often neglected. Measurement of the soil heat flux Several methods are available to determine for a landsurface (see Brutsaert, 1982), but a detailed review is beyond the scope of this book. One of the more reliable methods to measure considers changes in heat storage in the upper layer of the soil, as described by the equation (z) (2.83) Q Q C dz where and are the heat flux densities at levels and , respectively, is the Q Q z z C H1 H2 1 2 s volumetric heat capacity of the soil and is the temperature in the soil.

In the so-called combination method, suggested by C. B. Tanner of Wisconsin, is measured by means of a heat flux plate placed at a depth of 5–10 cm below the surface. The integral in Equation (2.83) is then determined from suc- cessive temperature profile measurements above the level of the heat flux plate (see also Hanks and Tanner, 1972). Empirically based methods to estimate the soil heat flux Whennecessarymeasurementsarenotavailable,thesurfacesoilheatfluxmaybeestimated on the basis of empirical relationships.

From available experimental observations, it appears that on average for bare soil can be given a value around 0.3 (see, for exam- Figure 2.26); however, for any given soil it can be expected to vary with moisture content. For surfaces covered with vegetation will normally be smaller and it will depend not only on the soil moisture state of the soil but also on the type of vegetation; for example, a value of 0.2 has been measured for maize (Perrier, 1975), and most measurements for grass have yielded values around 0.1.

Therefore, expressions like (2.85) and (2.86) can be useful to obtain averages over larger areas, especially, when used with remotely sensed observations. In the past, attempts have also been made to determine on the basis of analytical solutions of the linearized heat flow equation with effective parameters for the thermal conductivity and the specific heat of the soil profile (see Brutsaert, 1982, p. 151). However, also this approach can produce only rough estimates."}
{"text": "2.6.3 Minor terms in the energy budget Although they may be quite important under certain conditions, the energy absorption by photosynthesis, the energy advection, and the rate of change of energy storage are usually relatively small in most applications in hydrology. The flux of CO is usually neglected, although under favorable conditions, say on a sunny summer day, it can be of the order of 5% of the global radiation, and up to 8% to surface boundary condition 10% of the latent heat flux. An example of the fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor, estimatedbymeansoftheenergybudgetmethodwiththeBowenratio(cf.Equation(4.11)) on a day of intense photosynthetic activity, is shown in Figure 2.27.

In the case of tall vegetation, however, it may have to be considered; for example, it has been observed (Stewart and Thom, 1973) that this term can be especially significant after sunrise and near sunset, when it may be of the same order of magnitude as the net radiation . Still, on a daily basis it can be safely neglected. When the layer under consideration is a snow pack, this term is generally important (McKay and Thurtell, 1978) since, as formulated in Equation (2.72), it includes the energy used in fusion.

Also shown are the radiative flux values at the top of the atmosphere and their attenuation on their way down. It can be seen that globally the net radiation at the Earth’s surface is 104 W m which is also roughly equal to the sum of the sensible and latent turbulent heat fluxes E. The evaporative flux is shown to be 85 W m because 1 W m produces an evaporation rate of roughly 1.07 mm of water per month, this is equivalent with an annual evaporation of 1.09 m, which agrees with the values listed in Table 1.1. If it is assumed that there is no global warming (or cooling), the sum of the incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere must also be zero. The ratio of the outgoing and incoming short- wave radiation shows that the average albedo of the Earth–atmosphere system for extra- terrestrial radiation is of the order of 0.3. Globally, the atmosphere is being warmed by the short-wave radiation at a rate of 342 169 25 96 W however, the rate of − − = −200 net long-wave radiation input into the atmosphere is 385 345 240 W which results in a cooling. Thus the net cooling rate of the global atmosphere due to radiation is 200 104 W m and this is balanced by the energy input into the atmosphere by the surface turbulent heat fluxes E. The energy fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, as shown in Figure2.28,werederivedwiththeconstraintthattheywouldexhibitaperfectlybalanced steady state. In fact, the separately measured fluxes do not exhibit a perfect balance, but the discrepancy is only of the order of a few W m the issue continues to be the subject of intense investigations.

{"text": "3.1.1 Mechanisms Several processes take place jointly in the formation of precipitation. In brief, these are the production of supersaturation of the air, condensation of water vapor into ice crystals and droplets, the subsequent growth of these condensation products, and the supply of moist air to where the first three processes occur. These processes involve a number of different mechanisms, which are briefly reviewed in what follows. Cooling of the air As indicated in the previous chapter, the water-holding capacity of air decreases, as its temperaturedecreases.Thus,aircanbecomesupersaturatedbybeingcooleddown.Such cooling can occur by advection, for instance, as warmer air moves over a colder surface, byradiativecoolingoralsoasaresultofthemixingoftwodifferentairmasses;butthese aregenerallynotveryeffectivemechanismsandonlycapableatmostoffogformationor light drizzle. A more effective mechanism of cooling of the air consists of its being lifted to higher elevations; in the generation of precipitation this is by far the main mechanism. Air can be forced to rise by being heated from below, by moving over mountainous terrain, or by frontal activity, that is by having to move over relatively heavier, that is colder air. When the vertical air motions are relatively weak and gentle, for example in the case of stable air in a warm front, the lifting may result in what is referred to as precipitation. On the other hand, when the air is already unstable, and the stratiform vertical motions are relatively strong, the resulting precipitation tends to be of the so- called type. Under certain conditions the movement of air over mountainous convective terrain can involve a combination of both stratiform and convective precipitation. precipitation Condensation and growth of condensation products Whentheairreachesorexceedssaturation,watervapormaystarttocondenseintheform ofliquiddropsoricecrystalsonthesmallnuclei,suchasdust,smokeandvarioustypesof salt particles, that are invariably present in the atmosphere.

Therefore, any further growth of these droplets and ice crystals depends on the rate of diffusion of water vapor to their surface from the surrounding air and on the rate of conduction of latent heat away from their surface into the air; in the case of liquid droplets, there are also hygroscopic effects due to some nuclei, surface tension and for the larger sizes, accretion. It can be shown (see, for example, Fleagle and Businger, 1963) that the growth of droplets is primarily controlled by condensation up to radius sizes of the order of 15 Full-grown raindrop development to radii larger than 20 requires accretion by collisions and coalescence with neighboring drops of different sizes and fall velocities; this process, in turn, is affected by the turbulence of the air, the temperature distribution in the clouds and electrical effects. In contrast, the growth of ice particles depends only on vapor diffusion and on heat removal, and not on accretion; however, on account of the lower vapor pressure characteristics of ice, the watervapordiffusionprocessismuchmoreeffectivethaninthecaseofliquidwater.Ifthe particle sizes continue to increase, eventually they become too heavy and precipitation takesplace.Theonsetofprecipitationonthegrounddependsonanumberofconditions; most obvious among them is that the condensation products must be large enough to fall down against the entrainment of updrafts, and to overcome evaporation while falling down to the ground. A rough rule of thumb for the demarcation between precipitation and cloud particle diameters is around 0.1 mm. Substantial rates of precipitation usually can take place only when the cloud thickness is 1200 m or more. Blanchard (1972) has written an enlightening history of the discovery of the main mechanisms of raindrop and ice crystal formation. Moisture supply Calculation of the precipitable water, as defined in Equation (2.11), shows that even under the most favorable conditions an atmospheric column at rest can hold only a very limited quantity of water vapor. For instance (List, 1971), for a near-surface temperature of 20 and a surface pressure of about 1000 hPa, a saturated atmosphere with a pseudoadiabatic lapse rate can at most hold an amount, which is equivalent with about 5 cm of liquid water; for 10 this precipitable water is only about half as much.

These flakes tend to be larger at temperatures close to freezing. The specific gravity of snow can vary over a wide range (Judson and Doesken, 2000), but as a rule of thumb for fresh snow it is often taken around 0.1.

{"text": "3.2.1 Extratropical cyclones and fronts Thesetypesofsystemsnormallyresultfromtheinteractionoftwocontrastingairmasses. An air mass can be defined as a body of air with approximately uniform physical char- acteristics such as (potential) temperature and humidity. The interface between two different air masses is called a when relatively colder air displaces and moves cold front beneath relatively warmer air, and a in the opposite case. Cold fronts tend warm front to be relatively steep, with average slopes on the order of 0.015; in the Northern Hemi- sphere they are often oriented from the southwest to the northeast and move toward the east and southeast. An approaching cold front is usually announced by increasing wind speedsandtheappearanceofaltocumulusclouds(Figure3.1).Allthewhilethepressure decreases, and lower clouds, mainly of the cumulonimbus type, move in with the onset of precipitation. As the front comes closer the precipitation intensity increases. After the passage of the front the pressure rapidly rises and the temperature falls sharply; the wind direction changes, typically from a southerly or southwesterly direction to a more west- erly or northerly direction. Cold fronts are often followed by drier and cooler weather. The stability of the warm air mass determines the type of precipitation generated by a cold front. If the warm air is stable the clouds are of the stratiform type. The clouds are major precipitation weather systems Fig.3.1 Crosssectionofatypical coldfront.(Verticalscale isexaggerated.) Warm air Cold air Fig.3.2 Crosssectionofa typicalwarmfront. Warm air Cold air of the cumuliform type and the precipitation convective (see Section 3.2.2), if the warm air is conditionally unstable (see Figure 3.1). In this case, scattered thunderstorms and showers may develop, and in extreme cases the front may evolve into a continuous line of thunderstorms, called a line. Warm fronts are usually not as steep, with slopes that are on average of the order of 0.01; they also move more slowly than cold fronts, and are not as well defined. As the warm air moves over the cold air a broad band of clouds develops (Figure 3.2), extending up to several hundreds of kilometers ahead of the front’s position on the ground.Alsointhecaseofawarmfront,itisthestabilityofthewarmairthatdetermines the type of precipitation produced by the front. When the warm air in the approaching frontal air mass is moist and stable, the sequence of cloud types is cirrus, cirrostratus, altostratus, and nimbostratus, and the precipitation increases gradually. When the air is moist and conditionally unstable, the same sequence may occur, but altocumulus and cumulonimbus, often with thunderstorms, will also be observed. The interface between contrasting air masses tends to be unstable and it often evolves further, through the rotation of the Earth, into a spiraling stream called a cyclone. A cyclone is a large low-pressure zone, and it is usually accompanied by cloud systems and precipitation. An anti-cyclone is the opposite case, namely a high-pressure zone, which usually brings fair weather; it is also normally characterized by subsidence, a slow downward air motion resulting from the horizontal divergence of the air away from the pressure high. Althoughthereisaninfinitevariabilityintheoccurrenceofcyclones,theyhavecertain features in common; a typical life cycle of a cyclone is sketched in Figures 3.3, 3.4 precipitation Fig.3.3 Evolutionofatypicalextratropicalcyclone(intheNorthernHemisphere),asderivedfromsurface weathermaps,withthegeostrophicwindvelocityvectorsshownparalleltotheisobars;(a)illustrates anassumedinitialstateasastationaryfrontwithwindshear;thisinterfaceisunstableandit fronthasbeenovertakenbythecoldfrontandthecyclonehasbecomeoccluded.Fromthenonthe cyclonelosesitsstrengthandthefrontsgraduallydissolve. major precipitation weather systems warm air cold air cold air warm air cold air cold air Fig.3.4 indicatedinFigure3.3c.(Verticalscaleis exaggerated.) warm air cool air cold air VerticalcrosssectionalongthelineC–C(cid:2) Fig.3.5 indicatedinFigure3.3d,showingacold-frontocclusion. and 3.5. In the initial stage the winds on both sides of a stationary front are blowing in parallel but opposite directions. As a result of the shear and small disturbances, surface roughness or heating irregularities, the front may gradually assume a wave-like shape, which may persist and increase in amplitude, and eventually evolve into a counterclock- wise (in the Northern Hemisphere) flow pattern, called a wave. By now there is a well-defined cold front and a warm front, and the cyclonic circulation continues to intensify. The cold front section usually moves faster and eventually overtakes the warm front. At this point, which is the time of maximal intensity of the cyclone, the combined front is referred to as an or an front. In the later stages of occlusion occluded the occlusion, the intensity of the cyclone and the frontal movement gradually decrease; finally the occlusion vanishes while a new stationary front may be formed. Observe that, in contrast to the cold and warm fronts sketched in Figures 3.1 and 3.2, those shown in Figure 3.4 are assumed to involve a stable warm air mass, so that the clouds shown are of the stratiform type. Many different factors control the evolution of occluded fronts. It has been shown (Stoelinga al., 2002) that, more than the temperature contrasts, it is the stability contrasts across the fronts which govern the dynamics of occlusions. precipitation Frontal cyclones dominate the weather in the mid- and high latitudes, mainly in the colder season, when the contrasts between the equatorial and the polar regions are the most pronounced. In the warmer seasons, such cyclonic systems are generally weaker. They typically involve length scales of the order of km, also referred to as the mesoalpha(seeTable1.5),macro,orsynopticscaleandtheirhighestincidenceisaround latitude."}
{"text": "3.2.2 Extratropical convective weather Unstable atmospheric conditions have the potential of generating organized systems of convective quasi-vortical movement of air, over a wide range of scales. Recall that an ideal vortex is a flow in which the streamlines are concentric circles. In the atmosphere, however, convective systems are considerably more complex than an inverted bathtub vortex.Undertherightmoistureconditionsoftheatmosphere,thesesystemscandevelop into thunderstorms, and may consist of a single storm cell, or of several cells as part of a mesoscale convective system. The spatial extent of these systems tends to cover mainly the mesobeta into the mesoalpha scales, typically ranging from about 50 to 500 km, but individualcellscanbeassmallasonlyafewkilometers.Individualcellsarecharacterized by strong local updrafts and downdrafts. Simply put, the updrafts are a manifestation of theunstableconditionsoftheair(seeFigures2.2and2.4)andleadtocondensationinthe cooling air resulting in precipitation. The downdrafts, on the other hand, result not only fromtheentrainmentbyfallingprecipitationandsomeevaporativecooling,butalsofrom return flows required by continuity to compensate for the upward motions (Vonnegut, 1997); some of these are produced after updrafts reach their highest level and then fall back as downward currents. Most systems of this type are accompanied by a specific surface pressure pattern, first described by Fujita (1955) from time-to-space conversion of barograph data. In brief, this pattern consists of a high-pressure zone or mesohigh, trailed by a low-pressure zone, also called a or low. Some of the mesodepression wake mechanisms involved have subsequently been further elucidated (see Johnson, 2001) and are sketched in Figures 3.6 and 3.7. It is generally believed that the high pressure is a result of evaporative cooling in precipitation downdrafts below cloud base; additional effects may be caused by the impinging of the downdrafts on the ground, causing a pressure nose, and by hydrometeor loading. Williams (1963) showed that the observed pressuredeficitcouldbetheresultofadescending,orsubsiding,drycurrenttotherearof the convective air, but the causes for this remain unclear. The nose, also known as a cold air outflow leading edge or gust front, often assumes the form of a surge; some 20 cases have been studied with a 461 m tower by Goff (1976) (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9), which indicatethattheyhavesomefeaturesincommonwiththeopenchannelsurgesdiscussed in Chapter 7 (see also Simpson, 1997). At present, the details of storm development, and thepossiblerolesofgravitycurrentsandgravitywavesintheobservedpressurepatterns, are still not completely understood. Mesoscale convective systems of thunderstorms can be organized as squall lines or as mesoscale convective complexes. Squall lines or instability lines are relatively narrow bands of convective elements, like that illustrated in Figure 3.7; they are often major precipitation weather systems Fig.3.6 Typicalsurfacepressurepatternandverticalstructureofaconvectivesystem.Thetopshowsthecase ofweakandthebottomthecaseofsharppressuregradients,inassociationwithrear-inflowjetsthat proceedforwardtowardtheleadingconvectivelineorareblocked,respectively.(FromJohnson,2001.) accompaniedbybriefandsuddenwindstormsor“squalls,”andtendtooccuralongsharp cold fronts.

They typically produce deep cloud clusters and, intermittent with fair weather, heavy precipitation of the convective type.

Amounts of 15–25 cm in a 24 h period are not uncommon over level land."}
{"text": "3.2.5 Orographic effects The precipitation resulting from each of the general weather types discussed here can be markedly affected by topographic features, such as elevation, slope and aspect of the land surface. The result tends to be increased precipitation on windward slopes, and smaller precipitation on leeward slopes, also called rain shadows. In some regions with identifiable prevailing wind directions, such as the coastal ranges of western North America or the foothills of Meghalaya in eastern India, the windward slopes can be readily identified. On the other hand, as noted by Gilman (1964), in the Appalachian mountains, the windward and leeward sides can be quite variable, depending on the wind direction. Smith (1979) specified that there are three independent mechanisms of orographic precipitation, as follows. (i) Large-scale upslope precipitation, which is generated by forced vertical motion of the stratiform type or by triggered convection as theairmovesoverrisingterrain.(ii)Small-scaleredistributionofprecipitationfrompre- existing clouds by small hills; over the hill tops the precipitation is increased, because their higher surface can intercept the falling drops before they evaporate, and apparently also because the drops undergo increased accretion by washout of low-level clouds. (iii) Generation of upslope winds in a conditionally unstable air mass as a result of slope heating by the Sun; these develop into rising thermals, which in turn can grow into cumulonimbus clouds above the lifting condensation level. In general, because there are several other factors beside elevation, the effect of orog- raphy by itself in causing increased precipitation is not always obvious; physically, its maineffectisasatriggermechanismforconvectiveactivity.Accordingly,asobservedby Suzukietal.(2002),therelationshipbetweenprecipitationandelevationisusuallymore pronounced for convective than for stratiform rainfall. The relationship is also stronger andmoreapparentforlargeraccumulatedrainfallamounts,forlongeraccumulationtime scales, and for larger rainfall intensities. For instance, in the analysis of hourly rainfall data, the random effects of other factors may dominate the measured precipitation, so that the effect of topography may go undetected. With daily rainfall data topographic effects gradually emerge, albeit with large variations from one day to the next. With monthly data the effects of the other factors tend to become averaged out and the effect of elevation is more apparent. Numerous studies reviewed by Daly al. (1994) have reportedlinearrelationshipsbetweenprecipitationandelevation,butotherrelationships, such as loglinear functions have also been documented. In the mid-latitudes the climato- logical precipitation maxima tend to occur at or near the crest of mountainous barriers. However, in warmer regions (e.g. Hawaii), or in large-scale precipitation events (e.g. the Sierras in California) the maximal precipitation may occur somewhat lower, ahead major precipitation weather systems Fig.3.10 Moistairpassingoverrisingterrainmayresultinadownslopewindwhichiswarmeranddrier.The T (solidline)andspecifichumidityq graphontherightshowsthechangesintemperature (dashed z;thelapserateofthesolidlinesegmentsABandCDisverycloseto line)ofaparcelofairwithheight dryadiabatic,andthatofthesegmentBCisclosetosaturatedadiabatic.Theheight isthe condensationlevel,whereprecipitationstartsandtherateoftemperaturedecreasechangesfromdry adiabatictosaturatedadiabatic. of the topographic barrier; this may be due to upwind “rainout.” On the other hand, in some situations of steep and narrow mountain ridges, the precipitation maxima may be delayed, and may occur downwind from the crest of the barrier. Example 3.1. Passage over mountain barriers In the previous chapter the concepts of adiabatic lapse rate and the resulting atmospheric stability were in introduced. Figure 2.4 illustrates how air, which is initially stable, can be made unstable by being forced to rise. This is called conditional instability. As another illustration, consider this time an air mass that is forced to rise by moving over rising terrain, as sketched in Figure 3.10. Again, initially the temperature of an air parcel will decrease at a rate roughly equal to the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Above the condensation level this rate will become smaller, and roughly equal to the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. As the saturated air continues to rise, it cools further down and its moisturegraduallyprecipitatesout.Afteritpassesthepeak,andgoesbackdown,through its descent the air warms up at the dry adiabatic lapse rate and gradually becomes less and less saturated. Finally, after its passage downwind from the mountain the air is both warmer and drier than it was originally upwind. This type of phenomenon is variously referred to as F¨ in the Alpine regions of Europe, in southern California ohn Santa Ana and east of the Rocky Mountains of North America. Again, as was the case with frontal systems, when the entire incoming air mass is initially stable and moves precipitation Fig.3.11 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofthe Thiessenpolygonmethod toestimatethesubareas assignedtothe precipitationgagesonthe mapofacatchment.The subareasareboundedby theboundariesofthe catchmentandbythe linesdrawnmidway betweenthestations.The locationsofthestations areindicatedbythe numberedcircles. uniformly over the rising terrain, the resulting precipitation can be expected to be of the stratiform type. However, in situations when the incoming air is already unstable, much higher convective type precipitation intensities develop; this may be especially the case with irregular topography and uneven surface heating, when some parts of the air mass have higher temperatures than others at the same height, so that locally the convection mechanisms, as illustrated in Figure 2.4, come into play."}
{"text": "3.3.1 Spatial distribution Areal average from precipitation gages In hydrologic analyses at the basin- or catchment-scale, the input is of necessity taken as the average precipitation over the entire area. Different weighting methods have been used in the past to estimate this average from the available precipitation gage network. When no other information is available, the only possible method is to take the regular average value, i.e. the mean, with equal weights assigned to all gage stations. arithmetic When the locations of the stations are known on a map, the method Thiessen polygon (Thiessen, 1911) has been commonly used. Here each gage represents a subarea, , which is determined as the area bounded by the perpendicular bisectrices between the station and those surrounding it (see Figure 3.11); the spatial average is calculated by weighting the individual stations with their representative area, namely (cid:3)P(cid:4) precipitation distribution on the ground 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 23 24 21 22 25 Fig.3.12 Sketchillustratingtheapplicationoftheinversedistancemethod.Forexample,theprecipitationover (cid:3) (cid:3) subarea17isdeterminedas .Theaverageprecipitationovertheentire i,17 i,17 catchmentisthenobtainedastheweightedaverageofallsubareavalues,asshowninEquation(3.2). Thelocationsofthestationsareindicatedbythenumberedcircles. where is the number of rain gage stations in the area, and is the surface area of the catchment, that is the sum of the subareas, or . The method is equally simple in principle, but it is easier to imple- inverse distance ment. It is based on the assumption that the precipitation at any given point is influenced by all stations in the area, each weighted by the inverse of a power of its distance from the point. Note, as an aside, that the principle can also be used to calculate missing data. To obtain the areal average, the method is applied by subdividing the area into rectangular subareas, each with an assumed uniform precipitation as calculated for the point at its center; the resulting mean precipitation is then (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3)P(cid:4) j=1 i=1 i=1 in which is the surface area of the jth subarea, is the total surface area of the catchment,and nthetotalnumberofprecipitationstations; isthedistanceofthecenter of the jth subarea from the ith rain gage in the catchment and is a constant, which in most applications has been taken as 2. It can be seen that, for 0, Equation (3.2) produces the arithmetic mean. Dean and Snyder (1977) found that 2 yielded the best results in the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, whereas Simanton and Osborn (1980) concluded from measurements in Arizona that can range between 1 and 3 without significantly affecting the results. Figure 3.12 illustrates the application of this method. precipitation Fig.3.13 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofthe isohyetalmethodto estimatetheaverage precipitationovera catchment.The subareasAi arebounded bytheisohyetsandby theboundariesofthe catchment.Thelocations ofthestationsare indicatedbythe numberedcircles.

Many more methods have been proposed in the literature. Although they can be quite different in principle, a comparison of 13 of them has shown (Singh and Chowdhury, 1986) that over longer, say monthly or annual, periods they all produce comparable results; the shorter the time period, the more they can be expected to produce different results. Objective analysis The simple averaging methods just described are fairly arbitrary in their design and not based on well-defined criteria. However advances, in what is variously called objective analysis geostatistics namely the estimator, also known as kriging. This is a weighting best linear unbiased procedure, in which the weights are determined on the basis of the spatial structure of the rainfall fluctuations, and on the basis of the dual criteria that the estimation error, i.e. differencebetweentheestimatedvalueandthetruebutunknownvalue,atanypointbezero on average, and that the corresponding mean square error be minimal. For details on the application of this method the reader is referred to the specialized literature. Complex and mountainous terrain poses some additional challenges in the estimation of the precipitation distribution and its mapping. Attempts have been made to incorporate precipitation distribution on the ground orographic effects in objective analysis in the derivation of areal averages (Chua and Bras, elevationdata,includingheightandaspect,toderivelocalregressionequationswithwhich to distribute point measurements of monthly and annual precipitation to regularly spaced grid cells. Some distribution functions The areal distribution of precipitation over different time scales has been the subject of intensive research and numerous relationships have been proposed in the literature to reduce the estimated point precipitation, when it is to represent a larger area. In some of these, correlation studies were carried out relating the decay with increasing distance from a gage at a central location (Huff and Shipp, 1969; Hutchinson, 1969). For design purposes for use with point rainfall frequency data (and not with individual storms), in the United States the reduction factors shown graphically in Figure 3.14, developed by widely used. Various aspects of areal rainfall reduction procedures have subsequently of these investigations have shown that the reduction factor dependency on area is also a function of the severity, i.e. the return period of the event. However, it was also generally found that for several reasons the curves shown in Figure 3.14 are on the safe side, and therefore are likely to result in a more conservative design. Thus actual precipitation tends to decrease more rapidly with area covered, as the return period increases, than indicated in the figure; also, convective type storms exhibit a more rapid decrease with areathanthoseofthestratiformtype.Finally,althoughthereductionfactorsshowninthe figure appear to level off at around 1000 it has been found that in fact the reduction factor continues to decrease in an exponential manner as the area increases beyond that, even up to 20000"}
{"text": "3.3.2 Temporal distribution Precipitation is normally recorded on an hourly or daily basis, and in the data records it can be reported over different averaging periods. The description of the evolution of precipitation over time depends largely on the adopted temporal resolution.

In practice, the interception storage capacity is usually defined more specifically as the amount of water left on the canopy at the end of a storm, under conditions of zero evaporation and after all drip has ceased; thus during a storm the stored depth of water can exceed the storage capacity. The precipitation that reaches the ground is often called precipitation. In the case of vegetation, most of the net precipitation filters through the canopy as throughfall; a small part flows down along major branches and stems as stemflow, and tends to concentrate over the roots.

Similarly, sparse forests also tend to have lower values of interception, namely around 10% to 20% of the precipitation (see Gash al., 1995; Valente al., 1997). Interception losses in heather and shrub covered terrain are smaller than one third of the values in dense forest (Calder, 1990) under the same climatic conditions."}
{"text": "3.4.2 Interception loss mechanisms in vegetation For a single precipitation event the total interception loss is the sum of the evaporation from the wet vegetation during the event and the evaporation of the water remaining on the vegetation after the precipitation has ceased. Horton (1919) was probably the first to formulate this, for a storm duration D, which is long enough to saturate the vegetation, as where is the rate of evaporation of intercepted water and the interception storage capacity of the vegetation [L]. When the precipitation ceases before the vegetation interception Fig.3.18 Sketchillustratingthe waterbalanceofa vegetationcanopy. is fully saturated, the precipitation amount lost by interception is L E dt S in which is the amount of water stored on the partly saturated vegetation. Before this equation can be used to estimate the loss, the variables and must be known. Acommonwaytodetermine istotreatthevegetationasoneormorestorageelements, representing the canopy and the trunks, to which the lumped storage equation (1.10) can be applied. In the simplest approach, when a single element is assumed to represent the evolvingcanopystorage S,onecantaketheprecipitationastheinflow,andtheevaporation and liquid drainage as the two outflow rates (Figure 3.18); thus, = − − ≤ ≤ for 0 (3.8) cP E O S S where is the horizontal density or fractional cover of the intercepting vegetation, the precipitationintensity,and theliquiddrainageoutflowratefromthevegetation.Notethat Equation(3.8)shouldbeappliedonlytostandsofvegetationthataresufficientlyuniformat the scales under consideration; thus it would not be applicable, for example, in the case of chessboard-likesurfacesconsistingofforeststandsandclearingswithdifferentvegetation, or to sparse stands of trees in a grassy or bare soil environment. In such situations the analysis may have to be applied separately to each type of land cover and the results can then be weighted according to the fraction of the area each one occupies. Integration of Equation (3.8) yields for the storage S c for (3.9) Pdt E dt Odt S S precipitation Hence for short precipitation events that are not long enough to saturate the vegetation, Equation (3.7) produces a loss (cid:8) (cid:8) L for (3.10) c Pdt Odt S S Equation (3.10) is valid as long as the cumulative precipitation is smaller than the amount needed to saturate the vegetation, and (3.6) is valid after that, when . ToallowthepracticalimplementationofEquations(3.6)and(3.10),variousassumptions have been proposed by different authors, regarding c, , and O. The main difficulties in assessing these assumptions are the complexity of the vegetation cover precluding more thoroughanalysisandtheabsenceofexperimentalsupportformostoftheprocessesinvolved in interception. Some of these assumptions are briefly discussed in the following. Some common assumptions Thefractionalvegetationcover cisoftenassumedtobesimplyrelatedwiththefreethrough- fall coefficient p, as p); this coefficient is the portion of the precipitation that reaches the ground without hitting the canopy (Gash and Morton, 1978). Both and can be measured (see Section 3.4.3). The drainage rate has been estimated in various ways. The simplest way to describe it is with the assumption that as long as the canopy is partly saturated there is no drip, and that once it is saturated at the end of the storm the amount of water on the canopy rapidly falls to its storage capacity S (Gash, 1979; Noilhan and Planton, 1989). These can be written as 0 for (3.11) and, from Equation (3.8) 0 for (3.12) cP E O S S The rate of evaporation from the intercepting vegetation is the most critical but also the mostdifficultvariabletodetermine.Foroperationalpurposes,itisnowcommonly(Noilhan be estimated by means of a suitably chosen potential evaporation (see Chapter 4) from the fraction of the surface occupied by intercepting vegetation and that the evaporation from the remaining fraction can be ignored. For partly saturated surfaces during the wetting up phase of the interception process, it has mostly (see Rutter al., 1971) been assumed that the evaporation is proportional to the relative saturation ). (This assumption is an application of Equation (4.33) with (4.34).) Both assumptions can be combined as )E (3.13) Themainproblemwiththeseunderlyingassumptionsisthatitisstillnotveryclearexactly how this potential evaporation should be defined or estimated; this issue will require fur- ther study. In any event, these assumptions lead now to the following expressions for the interception loss. If t denotes the time to saturation, the loss for short precipitation events interception follows directly from (3.10) with (3.11), namely for and (3.14) L c Pdt S S D t For long events Equation (3.6) can be rewritten as (cid:8) (cid:8) = + + = > for and (3.15) L E dt S E dt S S D t i i ic i ic 0 by (3.13), (cid:8) (cid:8) for and (3.16) L c Pdt E dt S S D t i po ic 0 Equations (3.14) and (3.16) can be readily solved numerically by also keeping track of by means of (3.9). Lumped kinematic solution The assumption that the vegetation, as a hydrologic flow system, can be represented by a tionship given by Equation (3.13), is a perfect example of the lumped kinematic approach. Gash(1979;Gashetal.,1995)madeuseofthissimplestructuretoderiveaclosedformsolu- tionfortheevolutionof Swithtime;byassumingconstant(oraveraged)valuesof and during the precipitation event of duration D, he obtained (cid:13) (cid:14) ln (3.17) The time to saturation is therefore 0 ic po po whichcanbeusedimmediatelywith(3.14)and(3.16)toestimatetheinterceptionloss.For can be written simply as for and (3.19) L cPD S S D t [Pt ) ] for and (3.20) L c E S S D t i 0 0 po ic 0 where (PD) is the cumulative precipitation at the end of the precipitation event, and (Pt ) is the cumulative precipitation needed to saturate the vegetation. precipitation Stemflow and interception loss from the trunks In several past analyses of interception the water balance of the trunks and stems has been treated separately from that of the leaves (Rutter al., 1975; Gash al., 1995). Since the evaporation from the trunks is usually very small compared with the evaporation from the canopy, the resulting losses consist mainly of the evaporation of the water remaining on the trunks after the end of stemflow. Thus, for precipitation events long enough to saturatethetrunkstorage,thetotallossisequaltothemaximaltrunkstorage .Whenthe lossmaybetakenas (p PD),where istheproportionoftheprecipitationthatisdiverted to stemflow. In most situations, however, these losses are considerably smaller than those from the leavesofthecanopy.Forexample,forpineforestsinGreatBritain(Gash,1979;Gashetal., 1980), the trunk losses were found to be about 2% to 9% of the total interception loss; for the Amazonian rain forest a value of about 9% was observed (Lloyd al., 1988)."}
{"text": "3.4.3 Experimental determination of the vegetation structure parameters The main surface parameters controlling the interception loss are S and c; the surface roughness probably plays only a minor role through its effect on the evaporation rate. The storage capacity is usually estimated with a procedure proposed by Leyton al. (1967; see also Gash and Morton, 1978). The method is based on the observation that, as indicatedinEquation(3.6),thelossisequaltothecanopystoragewhenevaporationisequal to zero.

The free throughfall coefficient can be determined from throughfall measurementsforsmallstormsinsufficienttosaturatethecanopy(GashandMorton,1978) and the canopy cover can then be obtained by assuming p). Typical values of the specific canopy storage capacity (S (i.e. the storage capacity per unit area of cover) and of are respectively, 0.8–1.2 mm and 0.68–1.00 for dense pine 1988), and 0.64 mm and 0.64 for sparse pine forest and 0.35 mm and 0.60 for eucalyptus forest(Valenteetal.,1997).Forgrassesranginginheightbetween0.1mand0.5m, (S values ranging between 0.43 and 2.8 mm have been reported (Merriam, 1961).

{"text": "3.5 RELIABILITY OF OPERATIONAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENTS Precipitation was probably the first hydrologic variable to be measured regularly on a routine basis, and in many places in the world such measurements started more than a century ago. Thus for a variety of purposes in hydrology, the availability of this historic data base presents a useful opportunity. In principle the measurement of precipitation shouldbeasimplematter.Itisimportanttobeaware,however,thatmostoftheavailable records of precipitation from the past suffer from substantial systematic error and that caution is required in their use. This has, of course, been known for a long time (see, for al., 1992; Duchon and Essenberg, 2001), but it is only in relatively recent years that steps have been taken to remedy the situation. Although much remains to be done to solve the archival precipitation data correction problem (Groisman and Legates, 1994), a better understanding is gradually emerging. Standardprecipitationgagesareusuallyplacedwiththeirorificeatsomeheightabove the ground (from 0.5 m on up, depending on the type), primarily for convenience and to avoid raindrop splash and snow drift.

Figure 3.20 illustrates the distortion of the wind field above a rain gage, as derived from wind-tunnel measurements by Nespor this case the velocity of the air above the gage is about 20% to 30% higher than in the approaching undisturbed wind field.

Different measurement techniques have been tried to solve this problem (see Rodda, 1967; Robinson and Rodda, 1969; Sevruk, 1974). The best is probably to use pit gages reliability of operational precipitation measurements Fig.3.23 Cut-awaysketchofthetworeferencestandardprecipitationgagesrecommendedbytheWorld MeteorologicalOrganization(WMO)forcalibrationpurposes.Thepitgage,whichissurroundedby ananti-splashgrid,isforrain;theshieldedgage(3),whichissurroundedbytwofencesof4and12m (Duchon and Essenberg, 2001) with their orifice at ground level. Wind shields are also being used, but most of the designs can only alleviate the problem and never eliminate it; while they are useful in reducing the catch deficiency for snow, they appear to have much less of an effect for rain. For the purpose of calibration of pre- cipitation gages of different types of design, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has recommended the use of two reference standard gages, which have been found to have negligible wind error (Sevruk, 1993b) and which are shown schemat- ically in Figure 3.23. The reference gage for rain consists of a Mk2 gage (British Meteorological Office), installed in a pit with the orifice flush at ground level and surrounded by a grid to avoid splash. The reference gage for snow is a Tretyakov gage (Russian Meteorological Services) with a shield and surrounded by two octag- onal lath-fences, respectively 3 m high and 4 m diameter, and 3.5 m high and 12 m diameter. Additional losses may be caused by initial wetting of the gage (i.e. interception), evaporation, and by the mechanisms of recording gages. Methods have been devel- oped to correct for these systematic errors of undercatch (see, for example, Legates and Nespor and Sevruk, 1999). These studies have led to the consensus that beside mean wind speed, also the rainfall rate and the drop size distribution should be considered in applying corrections to the measured data. Some of these effects are illustrated in Figures 3.22 and 3.24. A study by Habib al. (1999) showed that the averaging time should be considered in the error estimation; an hourly time scale or smaller was recommended. precipitation Integral wind-induced error – Mk2 gage = = -1.0 1.0 v = 5 m s 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall Integral wind-induced error – Hellmann gage = = -1.0 1.0 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall (mm inmmh−1.The ASta(AutomaticStation)precipitationgages,asafunctionoftherateofrainfall errorwascalculatedforthreewindspeeds,asindicated,andfortwotypesofraindropsize −1),andthunderstorm(κ distributions,namelyorographic(κ = = 1).(FromNesporandSevruk, references Integral wind-induced error – ASTA gage = = -1.0 1.0 v = 5 m s 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall (mm Fig.3.24 REFERENCES Alila, Y.

{"text": "4.1 EVAPORATION MECHANISMS As a physical phenomenon, evaporation is the transition of water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase. This transition requires first, an energy supply to provide water molecules the necessary kinetic energy to escape from the liquid surface; and second, some mechanism to remove the escaped molecules from the immediate vicinity of the liquid surface thus preventing that they would return to condense (see Figure 4.1). These two requirements have traditionally given rise to two classes of methods to describe evaporation, namely (i) masstransferoraerodynamicformulations,whichconsistprimarilyofthedescrip- tion of the water vapor transport mechanisms in the near-surface air of the atmo- sphere, and (ii) energy budget formulations, in which the main focus is on the energy supply aspects of the phenomenon. Actually, this classification scheme is somewhat unsatisfactory, because it is almost never possible to consider mass transfer and energy aspects of evaporation in isolation from each other; as will become clear below, energy budget methods usually cannot avoid mass transfer considerationsin their application, and vice versa. Nevertheless, this classification will be used in what follows, mainly for historic reasons. In addition, a third class of methods is considered, namely (iii) water budget formulations, in which evaporation is treated as the unknown rest term in the continuity equation (1.7) or (1.8) for various types of control volumes that include the landsurface–atmosphere interface as a boundary. Among these three, the formulations in class (i) are based on the most direct descrip- tion of the water vapor transport mechanisms, so that whenever possible they should evaporation Vapor removal by turbulent air Condensation Vaporization by kinetic energy Liquid water Fig.4.1 Liquidwatermoleculeswithsufficientkineticenergyescapefromtheliquidsurfacebyvaporization.

The formulations in class (ii) are indirect since they make use of quantities that are physically quite different from water vapor transport, as such; however, since noneofthesequantitiesispartofthehydrologiccycle,energybudgetmethodsstillallow independent estimates of the water vapor flux. This is not the case for the formulations in class (iii). Although conceptually the most obvious and appealing among the three, water budget formulations require a knowledge of all the other components in the water budget;thustheyareunsuitablewhenevertheobjectiveisclosureofthehydrologiccycle and independent estimates of all its components are required."}

While the theoretical basis of this method is straightforward, the requirements on the instrumentation are quite stringent. For instance, for measurements at a few meters above the ground, the upper frequency response limit should be at least of the order of 5–10 Hz. Therefore, it is only in recent years that sufficient progress has been made in the development of suitable instrumen- tation, that is commercially available. However, because the instrumentation is costly and requires special skill to operate, at present this method is a realistic option only in special experimental settings. mass transfer formulations Variance methods WhenthedataneededforEquation(4.1),andtemperaturefluctuationsθ(cid:2) areavailable,they can also be used to calculate the variances of the fluctuations (q(cid:2))2 ; ; (4.2) These may then be related to the covariance given in (4.1), i.e. the rate of evaporation, by means of simple similarity assumptions.

{"text": "4.2.2 Methods in terms of mean variables Over a uniform surface with adequate fetch, formulations in terms of mean variables are based directly on the similarity principles for the atmospheric boundary layer discussed in Chapter 2. The word “mean” as used here, refers to the fact that the and data are obtained by averaging over a certain time period, in the same way as was explained for the second moments in the previous section. These methods can be classified into two general types, namely bulk transfer methods and mean profile methods. Bulk-transfer approach In this approach the flux is determined by means of equations, whose general form is temperature, respectively. One of the more common forms of (2.33) used in practical applications is as follows E Ce u (q q ) (4.3) where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to measurement levels z and z above the ground, the subscript s refers to the ground surface at z 0 and Ce can be determined theoreti- cally or empirically. The specific humidity at the surface q must be known in Equation saturation value at the temperature of the water surface. The main practical advantage of this mass-transfer approach, usually with a constant-known coefficient Ce, lies in the fact that it can be applied on a routine basis with regular and easily obtainable data of mean wind speed, water surface temperature and humidity of the air. As discussed already in Section 2.5.2, Equation (4.3) can be justified readily by the these functions also show that any empirical mass transfer coefficient Ce for data taken in the atmospheric boundary layer, can only be constant if the roughness parameters are evaporation constant, and either if the atmosphere is neutral, or if the effect of stability as reflected in is negligible or constant. Example 4.1. Mass-transfer coefficient in neutral atmosphere Under neutral conditions by virtue of (2.41) and (2.44), the water vapor transfer coeffi- cient, as it appears in Equation (4.3), is simply Ce (4.4) 2 0 0v 1 0 0 inwhich z and z aretheheightsofthemeasurementofthewindspeedandofthespecific humidity, respectively, and in which can be taken to be zero over a water surface. Within a certain range of normal wind speeds, neutral conditions are apparently often satisfied over ocean and sea surfaces. Indeed, numerous experimental determinations have shown that on average the ocean transfer coefficients are of the order of Ce ( −3,inwhichthesubscriptindicatesthatthemeasurementsare 1.2 (±0.30) × takenat z z 10mabovethesurface.Generally,thecorrespondingdragcoefficient 1.4 (±0.3) × is a little larger, and of the order of Cd 10 on average; it also tends to be more sensitive to the sea state. The scatter among many of the experimental estimates of the transfer coeffi- cients Ce and Cd over water is considerable. This means that when accurate 10 10 10 results are required the use of some average coefficient may not be adequate and it may be necessary to include the effects of atmospheric stability and of the roughness lengths, and therefore in the case of water surfaces, also of sea state. Numerous expres- sions have been proposed relating Cd to wind speed or surface shear stress for large water surfaces (see Brutsaert, 1982). Over water surfaces of limited size, such as small lakes, Ce can be expected to depend on fetch, that is the distance from the upwind shore. However, in the case of medium size lakes, with fetches of the order of 1–10 km, Ce is quite insensitive to fetch, provided the specific humidity of the air and the wind speed are determined over the center of the lake surface. Thus Equation (4.3) with Ce 1.2 10 can also be used for such conditions as a first approximation. For more accurate results, however, it may be advisable to calibrate Ce in (4.3) for each individual lake. The form of (4.3) is, in a sense, also suggestive of many other types of mass transfer equations,mostlyempirical,whichhavebeenproposedinthepast.Onesuchevaporation equation, originally proposed by Stelling in 1822 (see Brutsaert, 1982) and still in use today, can be written as where e ¯ is the mean vapor pressure and the subscripts refer to the heights of the mea- surements. From the definition of the specific humidity q with the equation of state for water vapor (2.5) and for bulk air (2.6), it follows that to a good approximation q 0.622 (4.6) mass transfer formulations This shows that the vapor pressure e is closely proportional to the specific humidity q. Theintroductionoftheadditionalconstantain(4.5)maybeviewedasameansofimprov- ing the curve-fit between the mean wind speed and the rate of evaporation. Although their theoretical justification is marginal, equations like Stelling’s (4.5) have been found useful to describe evaporation from water or wet surfaces. Some examples for various problemsandsurfacescanbefoundinpapersbyPenman(1948,1956),BrutsaertandYu equations, in terms of the vapor pressure difference, are sometimes written in a more general form as follows where,asbefore,thesubscriptsrefertothelevelsabovethesurface z and z atwhichthe measurements are made, and (u) is called the wind function, which can be obtained Mean profile methods The available flux-profile functions for the boundary layer given in Section 2.5.2 allow the calculation of the surface fluxes from measurements of mean concentration at two or more levels. The specific form of the profile functions depends on the level above the surface, i.e. the specific sublayer, where the measurements are made (see Figure 2.6). Profile methods are most useful in the atmospheric surface layer, where they can be based on the Monin–Obukhov similarity. Recall that the surface sublayer is the fully turbulent layer, located between a height , which is well above the surface roughness elements – say at least four to five times their height h – and a height z , which is roughly of the order of one tenth of the thickness of the boundary layer; a more precise estimateoftheextentofthesurfacelayerispresentedinSection2.5.2.Theprofilesinthis these equations refer to a lower and upper level at which the respective measurements of and aremade;clearly,theseelevationsneednotbethesameinallthreeequations. Inthisapproach,thefluxofanyadmixture,beitE,u∗ orH,cannotbecalculatedsimply from measurements of its corresponding concentration, u or only; indeed, except fluxes. In practice there are two alternative methods of closing a flux determination problem. The first method consists of the simultaneous solution of Equations (2.50)–(2.52) surements at least at two levels of mean specific humidity, mean wind speed and mean temperature. This numerical problem may be solved in different ways. One simple way is by iteration, as follows; it is assumed initially that the profiles are logarithmic, i.e. that L=∞sothatthe (cid:6)-functionsarezero.Thispermitsthecalculationofafirstestimateof evaporation of the Obukhov length L in (2.46). This first estimate of L allows next the calculation in turn allow the calculation of a second estimate of L, and so on. The iteration can be stopped when successive estimates cease to change appreciably. When measurements of and are available at more than two elevations, at each iteration u∗, E and regression through the origin. Example 4.2. Evaporation by profile method in a neutral atmosphere Inaneutrallystratifiedatmosphere,theturbulentheatfluxisrelativelysmall;thereforethe ζ (cid:6)-functions file equations (2.40) and (2.43). Combination of these two equations allows the direct calculation of the evaporation rate by means of the following expression k2ρ(u − − u )(q q ) in terms of measurements of the wind speed at levels z and z , and measurements of specific humidity at levels and above the ground. An equation similar to this result wasfirstpresentedbyThornthwaiteandHolzman(1939).Whilethisderivationprovides agooddidacticillustrationoftheprofilemethod,itshouldbenotedthatEquation(4.8)is oflimitedpracticalapplicability,becauseoverlandtheatmosphereisonlyrarelyneutral. Thus, in most cases the profile method requires solution of the full set of equations The second method consists of using the known mean profile and the surface flux of another but similar scalar, in addition to the mean profile of the scalar under consider- ation. The requirement of similarity refers in this context to the equality of the transfer (cid:6) (cid:6) scalars; in this sense, it also refers to the equality of the functions and in the of this principle is the Bowen ratio (Bowen, 1926) Bo E (4.9) in which L is the latent heat of vaporization of water. Hence, if similarity is valid, this ratio, which is used mostly in the energy budget method (see Section 4.3) can also be written in terms of profile measurements as follows Bo (4.10) L (q q ) Over water the surface values and q are commonly used instead of values in the air and q , respectively. The Bowen ratio concept thus leads to a simple expression energy budget and related formulations forevaporationintermsofthesensibleheatfluxandofmeanspecifichumidityandmean temperature measurements in the surface layer, as follows As an aside, in a similar way the surface flux of any other passive admixture of the air (e.g. CO ) can be estimated by means of (4.11), by replacing the measurements of q in this expression by measurements of the mean concentration c of the admixture under consideration. Alternatively, the surface flux F of any admixture can also be expressed in terms of, say, measurements of mean specific humidity and concentration c, and a known rate of evaporation, as follows F (4.12) So far in this section, the mean profile method has been explained for application with profile data in the surface layer. In principle, the method can also be applied with upper air data measured in the outer region of the boundary layer by means of bulk ABL similarity the same reason, the simultaneous solution of these bulk similarity equations may require an iteration method, like the one described above for the surface layer (Mawdsley and Brutsaert,1977).Amorerecentformulationofthefunctionssuitableforthispurposeunder unstable conditions is given in Equations (2.69) and (2.70). One unresolved difficulty with this approach, however, is that in the outer region temperature and humidity do not exhibit similarity, so that, as shown by Brutsaert and Chan (1978), C is not equal to D."}
{"text": "4.3.1 Standard application When the main objective is the determination of evaporation E (or the sensible heat flux into the air H), it is convenient to rewrite the energy budget equation (2.72) as where is defined as the available energy flux density Q R G L F A n n p p h whose terms are discussed in Section 2.6. As mentioned, in many applications the last three terms in (4.14) are of little consequence, so that it is often sufficiently accurate to In hydrology it is common practice to express the specific energy fluxes as equivalent rates of evaporation; Equation (4.13) can then be written as E H Q (4.15) = H/L = /L where H and Q Q . Observe, however, that with a typical value of e e ne n e = 2.466 × L J kg (at 15 Cin Table2.4),1Wm isroughlyequivalentwithan evaporation of 1.07 kg m per month. Thus as a rule of thumb, to have a rough idea of evaporation the magnitudes of the fluxes involved, energy flux units of W m can be interchanged with hydrologic units of millimeters per month (mm mo of liquid water evaporation. When Q and either H or E can be determined independently, Equation (4.13) provides directly the remaining unknown flux. Usually, however, both and are unknown, and an indirect method must be used. From the methodological point of view, these indirect energy budget methods are analogous to the mean profile meth- ods of Section 4.2.2. In both, essentially three equations are used which contain three unknowns E, u∗ and H implicitly. In the profile methods these are the equa- tions for u and In the energy budget methods, (4.13) is used either with equations for q and or with equations for u and or q, as will be shown next. With Bowen ratio (EBBR) When is known, the combination of the energy budget equation (4.13) with the Bowen ratio defined in Equation (4.9) produces E (4.16) Similarly, for the sensible heat flux one has Bo can be determined as shown in (4.10), from profile data of temperature and specific humidity in the atmospheric surface layer. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, these data should be taken as averages over 15–30 min, approximately. Equation (4.16) shows that the energy budget with Bowen ratio (EBBR) method is most accurate when Bo is small. Both (4.16) and (4.17) produce a singularity when Bo but, as pointed out by Tanner (1960), over an active vegetation this is not a problem, as this situation usually occurs when is low, around sunrise, sunset and occasionally at night. The situation does occur more often over cold water, and it may be necessary to use an alternative −1 < < −0.5 method when Bo to avoid the problem of a very small denominator in for these special conditions. Another way consists of using mean values of Bo corrected by means of wind measurements, as outlined by Webb (1964); this method is especially useful when some terms in the available energy Q are only known for daily periods or The EBBR method has the advantage that no similarity functions for the atmospheric turbulence appear explicitly in the formulation. With Equation (4.10) no measurements of turbulence or of the mean wind speed are required, and the formulation, as written small, the EBBR method may be less susceptible, albeit not immune, to imperfect fetch conditions, than mean profile methods, in which such effects are more directly apparent. The validity of the EBBR method depends critically on the similarity of the temperature and humidity profile; for the surface layer this requires the equality of the terms in the energy budget and related formulations (cid:6) = (cid:6) supports the view that , even under stable conditions (see Dias and Brutsaert, With profiles of wind and of a scalar (EBWSP) If the profile data, either of the mean temperature or of the mean specific humidity, are lackingtoapplytheEBBR,theenergybudgetmethodcanbeappliedinsteadwiththemean windspeedprofile.Infact,thisprocedureispotentiallymorepowerfulthantheBowenratio method, because it yields not only E and H but also u∗. As an illustration of this method, suppose that the specific humidity measurements are not available. It is then possible to use Equation (4.13) together with profile equations with three implicit unknowns E, u∗ and H. This system can be solved with measurements , θ −θ θ −θ) −u of (or and (or and ).

By virtue of Equation (4.6), the Bowen ratio (4.10) can also be written in terms of the vapor pressure; with lower measurements at the surface, where e e (T ), the Bowen ratio is Bo (4.18) where and are the vapor pressure and temperature in the air, respectively, at some reference level, and where evaporation Table4.1 andΔcanbeobtainedfromTable2.4) (γ/(cid:9)) Air temperature T 10 0.7934 15 0.5967 20 0.4549 25 0.3505 30 0.2731 35 0.2149 40 0.1707 is commonly referred to as the psychrometric constant; at 20 C and p 1013.25 hPa it is 0.67 hPa K Note that the difference is replaced by that of T, since they are often practically the same in the surface layer. The crucial step in Penman’s analysis is the assumption = (cid:9) ∗/dT)istheslopeofthesaturationwatervaporpressurecurve ∗ ∗ (cid:9)=(de = where (T) at the air temperature T (see Figure 2.1); e e (T ) is the corresponding saturation vapor pressure and (T ) is the vapor pressure at the temperature of the surface, as indicated by the subscript. Since e for a wet surface is the value at saturation, the Bowen ratio (4.18) is thus, approximately (cid:4) (cid:5) Bo 1 (4.21) (cid:9) − (cid:9) γ In this expression depends only on temperature and depends on both temperature and pressure. Values of for different temperatures at p 1000 hPa are presented in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2; they were obtained by means of (4.19) and values of and L listed in Table 2.4. Substitution of (4.21) into (4.16) produces (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:7) 1 (4.22) (cid:9) (cid:9) − In the second term on the right of Equation (4.22), a bulk-transfer equation can be used, yields the desired result, the Penman (1948) equation in its usual form (cid:9) γ Q E (4.23) energy budget and related formulations 0 10 20 30 40 Temperature ( C) Fig.4.2 isdefinedbyEquation(4.18) andΔ =de isshowninFigure2.1,andcanbeobtainedfromEquation(2.12)orfromTable2.4. where E , a drying power of the air, is defined by The ratio is illustrated in Figure 4.2 for a pressure of 1000 hPa. Note that in Penman’s (1948) original derivation it was assumed that Q R and that all the other terms in Equation (4.14) are negligible. As mentioned, from the practical point of view, the main feature of this result is that it requires measurements of mean specific humidity, wind speed and temperature at one level only. This is a direct consequence of the approximation introduced in (4.20). For this reason, Penman’s equation is useful when measurements at more than one level, needed for profile methods or standard energy budget methods, are unavailable or impractical. Equation (4.23) has been widely used, but there is still no generally accepted way to formulate (u ), the wind function in . Its definition in (4.24) suggests that any suitablemasstransfercoefficientcanbeusedforthispurpose(seeSection4.2.2).Penman (1948) originally proposed an equation of the Stelling-type (4.5) as follows where u is the mean wind speed at 2 m above the surface in m s and the constants require that E in Equation (4.24) is in mm d and the vapor pressure is in hPa. There are indications that Equation (4.25) yields reasonable results for natural terrain with small to moderate roughness (see Thom and Oliver, 1977); on the basis of experimental observations, it has also been suggested (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1975) that for irrigated crops, the constant 0.54 should be replaced by 0.86. In calculations of long-term mean evaporation values of E with equations like (4.25), to a first approximation the wind speed at 2 m can be estimated by assuming a power dependency on height, or u u (4.26) where z is the height (in m) at which the available wind data are measured. A more fundamental approach to determine the wind function is based on turbulence similarity. Thus in terms of the bulk water vapor transfer coefficient as defined, for example, in (4.3), in which is the height of the measurement of and that of , one obtains by virtue of (4.6), the wind function f (u ) 0.622 u (4.27) Ce can be determined by means of the similarity profile functions of Chapter 2. Under approximation) f (u ) (4.28) d a 2 0 0v 1 0 0 where, again, is the level of the wind speed measurement and that of the water vapor pressure. WhenPenman’sequationisappliedtocalculatemeanvaluesof E overperiodsofaday when hourly values are required, the effect of atmospheric stability, which varies through the day, may be important. It is possible to include the effect of the atmospheric stability in the wind function, by writing the drying power of the air (4.24) in a form similar to (2.56) (see also Brutsaert, 1982) as follows a 0 a 0 0v E ku∗ ) ln (4.29) where q and arethespecifichumidityoftheairandthesaturationspecifichumidityatair temperature, respectively. The problem can be solved by the following iteration procedure. An initial value of E is calculated in the usual way by means of Equation (4.23) using a (cid:6) = (cid:6) = calculated by means of (2.54) with 0. The initial value of is used to obtain by meansof(4.13).Theseinitialvaluesof E, u∗ and H provideafirstestimateoftheObukhov length bymeansof(2.46).Thisvalueof allowsnowthecalculationofasecondestimate asecondestimateof bymeansof(4.23),andsoon.Anexampleoftheapplicationofthis method has been presented by Katul and Parlange (1992). Evaporation from wet surfaces in the absence of advection The two-term structure of Equation (4.23) suggests an interpretation which may serve as an aid in understanding the effect of regional or large-scale advection. When the air has been in contact with a wet surface over a very long fetch, it could be argued that it may tend to become vapor saturated, so that E , shown in (4.24), should tend to zero. energy budget and related formulations Accordingly, Slatyer and McIlroy (1961) reasoned that the first term on the right of Equation (4.23) may be considered a lower limit for evaporation from moist surfaces. E Q (4.30) (cid:9) + γ was referred to as equilibrium evaporation, and the second term of (4.23) may be inter- preted a departure from that equilibrium. In the absence of cloud condensation or radia- tivedivergence,thisdeparturewouldstemfromlarge-scaleorregionaladvectioneffects, involving horizontal variation of surface or atmospheric conditions. Subsequent investigations have shown, however, that over wet surfaces, true equilib- rium conditions are encountered only rarely, if ever. The main reason for this is that the atmospheric boundary layer is never a perfectly homogeneous boundary layer, as would be the case in channel flow; rather, it is continually responding to unsteady large-scale weather patterns, involving condensation aloft and dry air entrainment, which tend to maintainahumiditydeficitevenovertheocean.Nevertheless,theideaunderlyingEqua- tion(4.30)hasledPriestleyandTaylor(1972)touseequilibriumevaporationasthebasis foranempiricalrelationshiptodescribeevaporationfromawetsurfaceunderconditions of minimal advection, E .

Still, it is remarkable that so many landsurfaces covered withfairlyshortvegetation,suchasgrass,whichisnotactuallywetbutwithamplewater available to the roots, yield about the same average values, ranging between 1.20 and 1.30, as open water surfaces. This may be the result of a fortuitous compensation of the specific humidity of non-wet leaf surfaces, which is lower than saturation, by a larger effective roughness, and thus transfer coefficient, of the vegetative surface. Still, in some studies drastically different values of have been reported. This has been especially the case for very rough surfaces; for instance McNaughton and Black (1973) obtained 1.05 for a young, 8 m high fir forest. evaporation Fig.4.3 VariationofBowen ratio formoist surfacesasgivenby Equation(4.32); thesolidcurve representsanα valueof1.26andthe twodashedcurves representvaluesof 1.20and1.30.The datapoints(fordaily values)were collectedbyDavies andAllen(1973) fromdifferent 10 15 20 25 30 sources.

Such equations, which provide a good alternative to (4.31) when only short-wave radiation and temperature are available, have beenusedtodetermineirrigationrequirementsandasclimatologicalindicesofpotential evaporation. However, the physical significance of such indices is not always clear, as is shown next. Potential evaporation Becauseseveralofthesimpleenergybudget-typemethodsforwetsurfacesareoftenused asmeasuresofpotentialevapotranspiration,afewcommentsareinorderonthisconcept. The term potential evapotranspiration appears to have been introduced by Thornthwaite (1948) in the context of the classification of climate. It is now generally understood to refer to the maximal rate of evaporation from a large area covered completely and uniformly by an actively growing vegetation with adequate moisture at all times. The area is specified as large to avoid the possible effects of advection. Although the concept is widely used, it has also caused confusion, because it does not encompass all possible conditions and it involves several ambiguities. The concept requires closer specification if it is to serve as an unequivocal parameter. Transpiration, even at the potential rate, involves such biological effects as stomatal impedance to the diffusion of water vapor, and the stage in the growth cycle of the vegetation. For this reason, the term potential evaporation is probably preferable. It can be defined to refer to the evaporation from any large uniform surface that is sufficiently moist or wet, so that the air in contact with it is fully saturated. Note that a wet or moist surface is not the same as one that has an adequate moisture supply for the roots of an actively growing vegetation; over short non-wet vegetation with adequate moisture the energy budget and related formulations evapotranspiration is often fairly similar to the evaporation from open water under the same conditions. As mentioned above, a possible explanation for this is that the stomatal impedancetowatervapordiffusionmaybecompensatedbythelargerroughnessvalues, resulting in larger transfer coefficients, of the vegetational surface. Another point of ambiguity is that potential evaporation is often estimated by means of meteorological data observed under nonpotential conditions. Because the air interacts with the underlying surface, this is not the same rate as that which would be calculated or observed, if the surface had been moist or adequately supplied with water. There- fore, potential evaporation estimated on the basis of measurements carried out under nonpotential conditions should be called “apparent” to reflect this fact. Examples of apparentpotentialevaporationaretheestimatesmadebymeansofanevaporationpanor by means of the Penman equation (4.23), on the basis of measurements in the actual, i.e. non-potential or arid, environment. Another example of apparent potential evaporation would be that obtained by means of Equation (4.3), in which at the dry surface is assumed to be given by q (T ), i.e. the saturation specific humidity at the temperature of that surface. In what follows the “true” potential evaporation will be denoted by , and the apparent potential evaporation by E ."}
{"text": "4.3.3 Operational methods for landsurfaces Many operational procedures used in applied hydrology to predict evaporation involve some type of potential evaporation, used in conjunction with a procedure to derive the actual evaporation from it for the prevailing non-potential conditions. Proportional fluxes with surface moisture “bucket” Probably the oldest method, which follows work by Budyko (1955; 1974) and Thornth- waite and Mather (1955), is based on the following proportionality E E (4.33) where E is a potential evaporation rate, and a reduction factor reflecting the mois- ture availability. As mentioned above, potential evaporation is a somewhat ambiguous concept; not surprisingly, therefore, in practice Equation (4.33) has been applied with two different classes of E , such as E , the apparent potential evaporation as defined in the previous section, and , the Priestley–Taylor equation given in (4.31). The reduction factor is often assumed to be a function of soil water content. In the application of (4.33) with such expressions for apparent potential evaporation as (4.3) and (4.23), a common assumption has been β = w > w e c 0 c 0 where is a critical soil water content above which E equals E , and is a lower cut-off value below which E is zero. This is illustrated in Figure 4.4. The value of can be determined on the basis of a soil water budget (see Thornthwaite and Mather, evaporation Fig.4.4 Illustrationofthecommonlyassumed relationshipbetweenthemoisture availabilityfactorβ andthewater contentstatusw ofthelandsurface complex.Inpracticalapplicationsthis canbeusedwithbothapparentand actualpotentialevaporation. must be determined by calibration; for a surface soil layer with an assumed thickness of about 1 m, is generally taken to be of the order of 10–20 cm of water. The reduction factor can also be related to some other surface moisture indices beside such as the accumulated actual evaporation minus precipitation (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), the local near-surface soil moisture content (see Davies and Allen, 1973; Crago and and the antecedent precipitation index (Choudhury and Blanchard, 1983; Mawdsley and Ali, 1985; Owe al., 1989), again through calibration of the model with available data. In some implementations of the same idea, the actual evaporation E is expressed in E )E (4.35) in which E can be determined by means of (4.30). For instance, Figure 4.5 shows the results of Davies and Allen (1973) expressed as the product ) versus volumetric water content of the upper 5 cm of the soil. Although a nonlinear function is fitted to the data, it is similar to Equation (4.34). With data measured over prairie terrain it was found by Chen and Brutsaert (1995) that, with as the volumetric moisture content in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile, the relationship between E and E can be described by the following linear function ) (4.36) 0.05 ≤ θ ≤ 0.27, (β α = 1.26 in the range and ) for higher moisture contents; how- ever, it was also observed that the relationship could be improved markedly by making ) not only dependent on soil moisture content but also on the density of the grassy vegetation cover, as expressed by the leaf area index La and the green vegetation fraction. energy budget and related formulations 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Scaled Soil Moisture, Variationof(β α e)withthewatercontentintheupper5cmofthesoilθ Fig.4.5 5,expressedrelativetoits valueatfieldcapacityθ forasandyloamcoveredwithperennialryegrassinOntario.Thecurve 1.26[1−exp(−10.563θ representsthefunctionβ α = /θ f)].(AfterDaviesandAllen,1973.) One difficulty in applying the formulation (4.33) with an apparent potential evaporation E is that, as the surface dries out, the two quantities on the right-hand side of (4.33) move in opposite directions. Indeed, whenever approaches zero, E tends to become large; this may lead to an unstable product of a large with a small quan- tity, each with considerable noise. On the other hand, E depends mainly on radiation and temperature, and not on the dryness of the air; hence application of (4.33) with E is likely to be more robust and therefore preferable. Surface resistance concept A second procedure of reducing to is based on the realization that the release of water vapor from a vegetation is controlled by the stomata of the leaves. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 4.6. The underlying idea is that the air is assumed to be saturated withwatervaporinsidethestomatalcavitiesbutnotattheoutsidesurfaceoftheleaves,and thestomataprovideanobstructionoraresistancetothediffusionofthewatervaporfromthe insidetotheoutsideoftheleaves.Thisisoftenreferredtoastomatalresistance r .Because evaporationalsotakesplacefromthesoilsurface,besidetheleaves,thebasicideaisusually extended to include this transport as well; thus the soil air at some depth below the surface can be assumed to be saturated and the soil pores can then be visualized as providing a resistance to the diffusion of water vapor to the soil surface. Hence more generally, the resistance approach is based on the concept of one or more resistance parameters in parallel and/or in series, which may account for the moisture stress in the vegetation and/or soil, and which relate saturation specific humidity , at the temperature T of the evaporating surface, to the actual (non-saturated) specific humidity q at the evaporating surface. Several such resistance parameters have been used for this purpose (see, for example, Monteith, 1973). The one given by Thom (1972) is instructive as an illustration and can be evaporation Fig.4.6 Sketchofatypicalcross sectionthroughthe undersideofaleaf.

For practical use there have generally been two types of evaporation equation based on the resistance concept. In the derivation of the first type, q , which is unknown, is eliminated betweenEquation(4.37)andthestandardmasstransferequation(4.3)toyieldtheexpression E ) (4.38) expression in a way analogous to (4.23), namely (cid:9)Q +γCe ρ −q E (4.39) energy budget and related formulations 1973; 1981; Thom, 1975) Numerousexperimentshavebeenconductedtodetermineresistancevaluesfordifferent types of vegetation. This has been mostly done in the context of expressions related to (Tan and Black, 1976). In addition, many attempts have been made to relate resistance parameters with such factors as Bowen ratio, soil moisture suction in the root zone, soil moisture deficit, humidity deficit in the air, solar radiation, temperature, leaf area index Lindroth, 1985; Stewart, 1988; Gash al. 1989). The relationships developed so far are mainly statistical, so that they are vegetation and site dependent. Therefore, the resistance formulation is probably not yet sufficiently general to be practical for predictive purposes, but it has been useful as a diagnostic index in certain simulation studies (for example, to calculate missing data). As a note of caution, in previous studies the resistance formulation has not always been For instance, the drag coefficient Cd (or the related so-called aerodynamic conductance) is often used instead of Ce, as required in the rigorous derivation of Equation (4.23) with above vegetation z , nor that (or ), Cd is rarely equal to Ce. As a result 0 0v m v h of this inappropriate use of Cd (instead of Ce), it is not clear how the turbulence aspects of the transport, normally embodied in Ce, can be partitioned or separated from the strictly vegetational and/or soil moisture aspects of the transport supposedly embodied in r . This has undoubtedly contributed to the difficulty in deriving general relationships for both Ce and r on the basis of (4.39). Although the resistance formulation with r may appear conceptually quite different from Equation (4.33) with the reduction factor , both approaches are, in fact, practically a wet surface) and a reduction factor β = (1+r Ce u (4.40) β = [1+r Ce (4.41) and as (4.33) with (4.31) and a reduction factor u ] Ce u (4.42) e 1 ne s 1 InpracticalapplicationsofEquations(4.38)and(4.39)aknowledgeoftheparametersCe and r is essential. The physical nature of Ce is well understood and based on sound turbu- lencetheory.Buttheconceptualsignificanceoftheresistanceconceptremainsproblematic, in spite of the many studies devoted to it. evaporation Complementary fluxes with advection–aridity ThisconceptwasfirstproposedbyBouchet(1963),whopostulated,almostindiametrical opposition to Equation (4.33), a certain complementary relation between the actual evaporation E, and what we now recognize as the apparent potential evaporation E . The underlying argument may be developed as follows. If for one or other reason, independent of the available energy, the actual evaporation E decreases below its true potential value E , a certain amount of energy not used up in evaporation becomes (cid:9)H, available. This manifests itself as an increase in the sensible heat flux or − = (cid:9)H E E (4.43) Attheregionalscalethisdecreaseof E,relativeto ,affectsprimarilythetemperature, humidity and turbulence of the air near the ground, but it probably has a smaller effect (cid:9)H, on the net radiation. This increased sensible heat flux causes an increase in the apparent potential evaporation E inferred for these drier and warmer conditions. In (cid:9)H, general, to a first approximation this increase can be assumed to be proportional to so that one has = + ε (cid:9)H in which is an effectiveness parameter, which may depend on the adopted defi- nition of . Combination of Equations (4.43) and (4.44) yields then (cid:9)H; increased by exactly in this case, combination of (4.43) and (4.44) yields immedi- ately the simple complementary relationship 2 (4.45) This result can be rearranged to yield the actual evaporation in dimensionless form and similarly the apparent potential evaporation In Equations (4.46) and (4.47) the ratio ) may be considered as a moisture or humidity index, which depends on such factors as soil moisture and vegetation density; both relationships are illustrated in Figure 4.8. It can be seen that the dependence of ), as given by Equation (4.46) and shown in Figure 4.8, has a similar trend as those shown in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Applications of Equation (4.45) have been made over different time scales, namely and Katul, 1992). In the application of Equation (4.45) by Brutsaert and Stricker pa po pe mated by (4.31). Thus it was assumed that the effect of the aridity on the performance of (4.23) under non-potential conditions would mainly show up in the second term, and energy budget and related formulations 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Moisture index, Fig.4.8 Sketchillustratingthecomplementaryrelationshipbetweentheactualevaporation andthe Epa,forvaryingconditionsofmoistureavailability,asexpressedby apparentpotentialevaporation E/Epa.BothEand Epa Epo. theirratio arenormalizedwiththetruepotentialevaporation not at all in the first term on the right-hand side. Substitution of (4.23) and (4.31) into (4.45) yields the practical result (cid:9) γ = (2α − − E 1) Q E (4.48) As before, there are several ways of estimating , the drying power of the air. It can simply be estimated in terms of the vapor pressure deficit by means of Equation (4.24) with Penman’s wind function (4.25). It can also be estimated in terms of the specific humiditydeficitoftheairbymeansofthemasstransfercoefficient CedefinedinEquation (4.3). In this case the actual evaporation is given by (cid:9) γ 1) Ce ) (4.49) The main advantage of (4.48), (4.49) and other equations like them based on the com- plementaryapproach,isthattheydonotrequireanyinformationrelatedtosoilmoisture, canopy resistance, or other measures of aridity, because they rely on meteorological parameters only. The main limitation is that, while the idea underlying (4.45) is simple and plausible, it was not arrived at in a rigorous theoretical or experimental way. Equa- tions like (4.48) and (4.49) have been applied in a number of studies in widely different climates. The approach appears to perform best under conditions with relatively mild advection. However, under strongly advective conditions with large saturation humid- ity deficits, it seems that the validity of the assumptions on which it is based become questionable. Sugita et al. (2001) concluded that (4.45) is only approximately valid in most cases; Hobbins et al. (2001) showed how the basic approach can be improved by calibration of the parameters and E (or Ce) in Equation (4.49). Although the evaporation complementary approach shows specific promise as a practical tool, it still awaits a definitive physical analysis to make it fully effective. A unified parametric formulation As reviewed here, several of the procedures in current practice, can be cast in a single form as follows (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:9) γ = β +b −q E a Q Ce u ) (4.50) inwhich a and b areweightingconstantsforthefirstandsecondterms,respectively,which γ(cid:2) together with the remaining parameters and depend on the chosen model.

{"text": "4.3.4 Diurnal cycle over land: the self-preservation approximation Itiswellknownthatundercertainfavorableconditions,whenhorizontaladvectionisnottoo strong, the daytime variations of the major energy fluxes at land surfaces are quite similar. This similarity in the diurnal cycle of the different energy flux components over land is illustrated in Figures 2.19 and 2.20, and in Figure 4.9. This means that during any given day the ratios of these fluxes remain approximately constant, which may be considered a manifestationofsomekindof“self-preservation.”Becauseevaporationisusuallyrelatively smallduringthenight,thisself-preservationcansometimesbeusefultorelatedailyaverages with instantaneous or hourly values. This idea was made use of by Jackson et al. (1983) by means of (L R ), in order to estimate the total daily latent heat flux on the basis of a one-time-of-day value. The idea was also used for the same purpose by Shuttleworth et al. evaporativefraction EF L G)orEF L E H).Crago(1996)applied the idea with still another dimensionless evaporation rate, namely , where E is the equilibrium evaporation defined in Equation (4.30). In more general terms (Brutsaert and Sugita, 1992), the assumption of self-preservation requires that the evaporative flux ratio, ER (4.51) be taken as a constant during the daytime hours. In (4.51) is some other flux term (beside L E) in the surface energy budget, which exhibits a similar diurnal cycle as L E, so that it can serve as a reference. The assumption of similarity can be assessed for differ- ent flux terms in Figures 4.10 (mainly the curves with the open symbols) and 4.11, with datameasuredduringFIFE,theFirstISLSCPFieldExperimentconductedinhillytallgrass terrain in eastern Kansas; it appears to work well when F is taken as the available energy energy budget and related formulations Time (CDT) Time (CDT) Time (CDT) Fig.4.9 DiurnalvariationofmeancomponentsofthesurfaceenergybudgetonJuly6,1987,measured atsixstationsovera15km× 15kmexperimentalareainahillyprairieregioninnortheastern LeE,Rn ,Rn G,H andα Kansas.(a) and and DaylightSavingsTime.(FromBrutsaertandSugita,1992.) evaporation Time (CDT) Fig.4.10 Diurnalvariationofhalf-hourlyvaluesofdifferentevaporativefluxratios,obtainedfromthe −G)(open LeE/α LeE/(Rn fluxdatashowninFigure4.9; (invertedopentriangles); −1,solid LeE/Rn LeE/Rs LeE/G LeE/(Rld LeE/ squares); (solidcircles); especiallythoseoftheopentriangles,theopensquaresandtheopencirclesarenearly coincidentduringthedaytimehours,sothattheymaynotbeeasytodistinguish.(From BrutsaertandSugita,1992.) butlessso,thereflectedshort-waveradiation .Thefactthatequilibriumevaporation that Equation (4.51) also works well when is taken as that quantity.

It was shown in Crago and Brutsaert (1996) that this is caused by the different error propagation properties of EF and Bo. Figure 4.11 also shows that self-similarity is not applicable at night. As a further illustration, Figure 4.12 shows the evolution of the daytime evaporative fraction EF during a long drying period over the same tallgrass prairie terrain at station 26; on any day EF remained fairly invariant during the daytime hours, but it decreased from day to day as the soil moisture was gradually declining (see also Figure 2.22).

Several methods have been proposed to apply Equation (4.55) to periods shorter than a year by using indirect methods to estimate the change in storage. water budget methods Closure by relating storage to evaporation Inthisclassofmethodstheadditionalequationisobtainedbyrelating E to S.Forinstance, was assumed to represent the water storage S in the basin and the value of was taken as a layer of 10–20 cm water, to be obtained by calibration with seasonal and regional E, P, R,S = + variations. The method can be applied with average monthly values of (S and (S ), in which the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the beginning and the end of the month. The calculations can be carried out by successive approximations as follows. An initial value of S is chosen at random for the first month. Substitution of (4.33) into (4.55) yields an equation for S and without E; with an initial value of S chosen at random for the first month this produces a first estimate of S , which when substituted in (4.33) produces E for the first month. The same procedure is carried out for the second month, with S of the first serving as S of the second, and so on. The sum of all these monthly values can be compared with the total annual value of (P R). The ratio of the two should allow a proportional adjustment of the assumed value of S of the first month, and the process can be started over again and continued until the calculated annual E equals the recorded (P R). The main weakness of any method based on a relationship such as (4.33) is, beside the question of the validity of this proportionality, first the unknown value of the maximal water content parameter , and second the rather ambiguousmeaningofthepotentialevaporationconcept.Budyko’smethodhasbeenapplied extensively over various regions of the former USSR. A very similar method has also been proposed by Thornthwaite and Mather (1955; see also Steenhuis and VanderMolen, Closure by relating storage to stream flow In a second class of methods the additional equation is obtained by relating S with the runoff R from the basin, usually during recessions of the river flow, i.e. during drought flows in the absence of precipitation, so that P does not have to be considered in Equation been done by means of kinematic functions, which can be written in the form S K (4.56) is another example of the lumped kinematic approach; after elimination of S, in principle it should thus be possible to determine E from streamflow data. The parameters K and m can be determined by calibration under conditions of negligible E. The main drawback of the application of Equation (4.56) in this context, is that the storage S in (4.56) refers mainly to groundwater storage and not to near-surface soil moisture which feeds most of theevaporativeprocessesinthebasin.Thismeansthatrecessionflowsaresensitiveonlyto evaporationfromareas,wheretherootsofthevegetationareindirectcontactwiththewater table.Hencetheevaporationdeterminedthiswayoriginatesmostlyfromtheriparianzone, and not from areas further away from the stream channels, where the vegetation and the groundwaterareessentiallyuncoupled.The S variableinEquation(4.56),whichdrivesthe streamflow R, can be assumed to represent total basin storage, only after the soil moisture has been totally depleted, that is after a long recession. This difficulty can be avoided, as shown by Dias and Kan (1999), by integrating Equa- (cid:9)t, tion (4.55) over sufficiently long budget periods at the end of which most of the water evaporation Fig.4.13 Meanmonthlyclimatology Jangada River basin (1975--1990) ofprecipitation, precipitation streamflow streamflowandseasonal SWB evapotranspiration waterbudgetevaporation (SWB)estimatesforthe Jangadariverbasin(1055 50◦20(cid:5)W),whichismainly coveredbyforest vegetation.Winterand summerarewelldefined, butprecipitationisfairly uniformthroughoutthe year.(FromDiasandKan, Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec storage consists of groundwater only, so that (4.56) can be used to determine S. The begin- ning of the budget period can be taken as the end of the previous recession, when again (4.56) can be used to determine S. The integral of (4.55) is simply the equation rewritten E, (cid:9)t dS/dt with values of P and R averaged over the budget period and with replaced − )/(cid:9)t.Thus by (S and ,whicharetheinitialandfinalvaluesofthestorage,canbe determined from streamflow data by means of (4.56), and E remains as the only unknown (cid:9)t in (4.55). In this approach the budget periods are of variable duration, and are taken to be at least one month long. The method was implemented by assuming that the system is linear, that is 1 in (4.56), and was determined from the lower envelope of a plot of daily flows versus the flow on the next day, i.e. Q versus Q during long recessions, while P 0(cf.Figure10.30);thelowerenvelopewasassumedtorepresentconditionsof small or negligible evaporation from the basin. Some results obtained with this approach are illustrated in Figure 4.13; in this particular case, it can be seen that even though the rainfall does not display a seasonal dependency, the seasonal signal is well reflected in the calculated evaporation. A similar approach to derive evaporation was used by Wittenberg and Sivapalan (1999). Finally, in a third class of methods the additional equation needed to close (4.55) is derived from the atmospheric water budget. In this approach the atmospheric water con- vergence allows the estimation of (P E), which then yields for basins where R is known. This is discussed next."}
{"text": "4.4.2 Atmospheric water budget Inthismethodevaporationisdeterminedasthe,preferablyonly,unknownterminthewater budget equation for a suitably chosen finite-size control volume in the atmosphere. Just like the terrestrial water budget, it is based on an integral form of Equation (1.10), which states that the total inflow minus outflow of water mass equals the time rate of change of stored water in the control volume. Thus for a control volume consisting of an atmospheric water budget methods column of base area A with periphery C, this can readily (Brutsaert, 1982) be shown (cid:8) (cid:8) (q ) (4.57) E P V dC dp where E and P are evaporation and precipitation intensity averaged over A, W is the total water vapor content per unit surface area of the control volume, is the specific humid- ity along the vertical boundary, V is the horizontal wind component normal to the same boundarypointingoutward, isthepressure,withsubscriptssandtreferringtothesurface and the top of the column, and the water content in the solid and liquid phases is neglected. Equation (4.57) states that the difference between the average rate of evaporation and pre- cipitation over a given area of the Earth’s surface equals the rate of increase of water vapor over the area plus the total flux directed away from the region. In the past this method has been used primarily over water surfaces (for a review of the early work, see Brutsaert, 1982). Among the first applications over land was the anal- ysis of Benton and Estoque (1954) for the North American continent, followed by those of Rasmusson (1971) and Magyar et al. (1978) for the USA. In the early studies, the data neededwereusuallyobtainedfromtheoperationalradiosoundingnetwork,withtwice-daily observations, so that was taken as the difference over 12 h. This world-wide grid was originally not designed for the purpose of budget calculations, but rather to observe synoptic-scale features with time scales of a few days and length scales of the order of km. Figure 4.14 shows a comparison between results obtainable with this method over water using radiosonde observations every 6 h at four stations with an enclosed = 17×104 km2,andvaluesobtainedusingamean-profilemethodbyKondo(1976). Rasmusson (1977) has made a detailed analysis of the errors in flux divergence computa- tions resulting from the usual limits of spatial and temporal resolution and of instrumental accuracy in typical radiosonde observations in networks of different scales. He concluded that with the operational network and current observational schedules, the applicability of the method to basins with an area smaller than is limited, and that the results arelikelytobeunreliable;withsuchdatathemethodcanyieldgoodresultsforareasofthe orderof25×104to106km2,butitisbestsuitedforareaslargerthan106km2.Inrecentyears, however, the situation has been changing. With the advent of improved data assimilation schemes, in which observational data can be combined with model calculation output, it is expected that the accuracy of the method may be improved considerably. As a result the method has been receiving renewed interest in the past decade (see, for example, Brubaker 1996). The appeal of the method stems mainly from the simplicity of the budget concept. It is the only approach that can estimate evaporation over larger areas, and it can be useful to compare or extend the results of more local methods."}

Other parameterizations Water budget considerations can also be used to express soil surface evaporation as a capillary rise phenomenon in terms of soil properties and other variables beside soil water content. However, such derivations require some understanding of the physics of flow in partly saturated soils and also the solution of the Richards equation for various boundary conditions. This topic is therefore delayed until Chapter 9, after the principles of flow in porous media have been presented in Chapter 8."}
{"text": "4.5 EVAPORATION CLIMATOLOGY InChapter1itwaspointedoutthatonaglobalbasistheannualevaporationisoftheorder of 1 m, which balances the annual precipitation. Table 1.1 indicates that the evaporation from the land surfaces of the Earth is around 0.5 m, which is roughly two-thirds of the mean annual precipitation. Interestingly, practical experience and folk wisdom suggest values similar to those given in Tables 1.1 and 1.2. For example, irrigation engineers, when lacking better information, sometimes use the rule of thumb that the duty of water for a well-irrigated crop is around 1 l s ha Similarly, farmers in the northeastern United States are said to require a weekly rainfall of about one inch, that is 2.5 cm, to maintain field crops in good condition during their active growing period. With typical irrigation efficiencies of 25% to 40%, and a growing season of 4–5 months, both practical estimates of the evaporative requirements in agriculture are consistent with global climatological values of around 0.50 m y However, because precipitation and the radiative energy supply are highly variable over the surface of the Earth, the actual evaporation is usually quite different from these long-term climatological mean values. Over periods shorter than a year, deviations of evaporationfromthemeancanbecharacterizedbyacyclicorperiodicbehavior,namely with a daily and with a seasonal time scale. In the extreme case of an arid, warm climate, with a pronounced dry and wet season, the seasonal evaporation cycle is similar to the evaporation climatology J F M A M J J A S O N D J Fig.4.16 Measuredmonthlyevapotranspirationratesinmm/dformeadowcoversonlysimetersatfour locationsintheeasternUnitedStates.ThedataatSeabrook,NJ(diamonds),Waynesville,NC Coshocton,OH(circles)areactualvalues,possiblyaffectedbyirregularrainfallandmoisturedeficits inthesoilprofile.Theannualmeanvaluesare2.44mmd−1 atSeabrook,2.16mmd−1 atWaynesville, and2.29mmd−1 atCoshocton.(AfterVanBavel,1961.) rainfall cycle. In a humid climate, or over water, the seasonal march of the evaporation rate follows closely the cycle of energy available for evaporation. In most climates over land the seasonal evaporation cycle is affected both by the available water and by the available energy. As an example, in Figure 4.16 the monthly mean evaporation rates are shown for several locations in the eastern United States. Thus, the cyclic behavior here is similar to the solar radiation input and to that of the air temperature. The same holds true for shallow water bodies. But over deep water bodies the evaporation cycle does not coincide with the solar winter–summer cycle. In contrast to a landsurface, a water body can store and release large amounts of heat and thus its temperature responds only slowly to energy inputs, not unlike the way a fly wheel responds to torque; as a result the cycle of available energy for evaporation may lag several months behind the solar input cycle. For example, the rate of evaporation from Lake Ontario is maximal in fall and early winter, and minimal in late spring and early summer (Phillips, 1978), as is also shown in Figure 4.17; the corresponding net radiation and heat storage are shown in Figure 4.18. The daily evaporation cycle is usually more pronounced over land than over water. Overland,wheremuchlessheatisconductedbelowthesurface,thedailycyclegenerally follows the daily march of the solar radiation. Illustrations of the daily cycles of evapo- transpiration from different surfaces are shown in Figures 2.19–2.22 and in Figure 4.9, together with other components of the surface energy budget. In Figure 4.19 an example is shown of the daily cycle of evaporation from bare soil. This figure also illustrates the general behavior of evaporation after a rainfall or after irrigation, when the available water stored in the soil profile is gradually being depleted. Because the experiment took place during a drying period, the daily cycle is superimposed on a trend of decreasing Fig.4.17 Monthlyevaporation (inmmmonth−1)from LakeOntarioduring 1972–1973,asweighted averagevaluesof estimatesbymeansof masstransfer,energy balanceandwater budgetmethods.The weightingfactorswere basedontheinverseof eachmethod’serror variances.(AfterQuinn andDenHartog,1981.)

Thus the flow system consists of an intricate combination of many different types of flow regimes, in channels of different geometries and sizes. For purposes of analysis, to describe the basic hydraulic elements of landsurface runoff, it is convenient and useful to distinguish between two major types of free surface flow; these are first, sheet flow or overland flow, which is most likely to occur under conditions of heavy precipitation in source areas where runoff is being generated which feeds into streams; and second, the flow that occurs in larger permanent open channels. Both types of flow are usually unsteady and spatially varied.

{"text": "5.1 FREE SURFACE FLOW The flow of water on a solid surface is governed by the usual conservation equations of fluid mechanics, namely the continuity equation for mass and the Navier–Stokes equations for momentum. One important condition on the boundaries can be formulated by observing that once a fluid particle is on an impermeable surface, it stays on it (see Lamb, 1945, p. 7). In other words, it moves with the surface, and its velocity relative to thesurfaceiseitherpurelytangentialorzero(inthecaseofnoslip),forotherwiseafinite flow of fluid would take place across the surface.

To simplify the argument, consider a two-dimensional motion of water with a free surface,whichislocatedatadistance,takennormallytothebottomsurface, from an arbitrary reference; the water is flowing over a bottom, which is located at a normal distance from that same reference (see Figure 5.1).

For the situation shown in the figure the function defining the position of the the water surface − w + = = 0 atz (5.3) Similarly, the bottom surface can be described by [z z] 0, in which the time dependency allows, in principle at least, for bottom sediment accretion or erosion; thus Equation (5.1) leads to an analogous condition for the bottom interface of the fluid, which looks the same as Equation (5.3), but with the subscript s replaced by a subscript b. Usually, however, the bottom can be treated as a solid wall without slip, so that this bottom condition reduces to 0. With the latter bottom condition, the condition for the free surface (5.3) can also be written in terms of the water depth as − w + = = 0 at (5.4) inwhichthewaterdepthisdefinedash andthereferencelevel 0isplaced at the bottom. hydraulic theory"}
{"text": "5.2 HYDRAULIC THEORY: SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS In most situations of free surface flow encountered in hydrology, it is possible to make certain simplifications. The main assumption is that the path- or streamlines are only slightly curved so that the accelerations normal to the direction of mean flow are neg- ligible. This means that the pressure distribution may be taken as hydrostatic along the z-direction, i.e. normally to the bottom, or + γ cosθ = θ γ(≡ ρg) where is the slope angle of the bottom and is the specific weight of the water. With 0 at the bottom surface, the integral of (5.5) is = γ cosθ(h − z) (5.6) where as before (z ) is the water depth measured normally to the bottom. If the bed slope angle is constant in the main direction of flow, Equation (5.6) yields immediately upon differentiation As this pressure gradient is not a function of z, the corresponding acceleration of the water particles is independent of as well. Therefore the velocity parallel to the bottom preserves its dependence on z, independently of and t. Accordingly, it is permissible to replace by its average over z, namely defined by These two simplifications, namely the hydrostatic pressure distribution and the assumption of an average velocity V, constitute the basis of the so-called hydraulic theory of free surface flow; as will become clear below, it reduces the two-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem. The theory is usually referred to as shallow water theory or the theory of long waves. It consists of reducing the continuity and the momentum or Reynolds equations to the shallow water equations. This will be shown in what follows."}

When the flow is turbulent, this is conveniently transformed intotheReynoldsequationforthemeanquantities.TheReynoldsequationcanbereadily obtained from Equation (1.12), by replacing each of the dependent variables by the sum of its mean and fluctuation, both in the turbulence sense, and by subsequently applying the time-averaging operation over a suitable time period.

With a no-slip condition at 0, this is never the case; nevertheless, in turbulent open channel flow, which is well mixed in the vertical, it is usually an acceptable approximation. However, for laminar and transitional flows, a correction coefficient (often associated with the name of Boussinesq; see Bakhmeteff, 1941), namely, β = (u/V)2dz/h may have to be applied to the first term on the right-hand side of (5.18), i.e. the advective acceleration term. The integration of the other terms in Equation (5.15) is straightforward. The third term on the left yields upon integration simply the product of and at h. If it can be assumed that is small, the first term on the right can be approximated by −sinθ −tanθ = replacing by , which is the slope of the bottom surface, so that its integral becomes (gS h). Similarly, the pressure gradient in the second term on the right canbereplacedbythewaterdepthgradientonaccountof (5.7),providedtheslopeangle is small enough. In the hydraulic approach to free surface flow, the integral of the last two terms of Equation (5.15) is usually expressed in terms of the friction slope , as a closure parameterization to account for the effects of the viscosity and the turbulence.

To recapitulate briefly, the shallow water equations are based on the following assumptions. (i) The pressure distribution in the water is hydrostatic sinθ tanθ = −S of viscous and turbulent stresses can be parameterized and combined in a friction slope Equation (5.19) can be taken as unity. Example 5.1. Steady flow The meaning of the different terms in Equation (5.22) can be illustrated by considering steady flow conditions in the absence of lateral inflow. Thus, after putting both and equal to zero, (5.22) can be readily integrated over a flow distance to yield + + δx = + + δx gh gS gh gS in which the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the entrance and exit of the flow section Figure 5.2 shows the balance of the left- and right-hand sides of this equation. Recall that the bed slope is sufficiently small, so that x, the coordinate along the bed, can be represented as horizontal in the figure. Because the integration of a force (or rate of momentum change) over distance yields work, the terms of Equation (5.23) may be considered as different forms of energy. In open channel hydraulics the energy per unit weight with respect to the channel bottom is called the energy; in the present specific + V2/(2g)]. notation this is [h As shown in Figure 5.2, its elevation defines the (EGL); the friction slope is the slope of the energy grade line. The quantity grade line S + p/(ρg)] [z in any cross section defines the (HGL); because this hydraulic grade line is equal to the water depth h, the HGL coincides with the water surface. Equations (5.13) and (5.22) were derived for two-dimensional flow, i.e. an infinitely wide channel.

{"text": "5.3 FRICTION SLOPE In the determination of the friction slope in the shallow water equations, it is commonly assumed that the resistance to flow, resulting from the last two terms of Equation (5.15), acts in the same way in unsteady nonuniform flow as it does in steady uniform flow. Thus, from inspection of (5.21) or (5.22) for such conditions one has The definition of for two-dimensional flow, as given in Equation (5.20), can be written for uniform flow, when 0, as water on the land surface in which here (cid:3) (cid:4) is the shear stress and in which the subscript denotes the direction normal to the plane on which the stress acts and the subscript denotes the direction of this stress itself.

If is the shear stress at the bottom wall where 0, this integration yields or, in terms of the friction velocity Unfortunately, an expression for in terms of the shear stress at the wall is not of much help at this point.

{"text": "5.3.2 Turbulent flow For Reynolds numbers larger than 1000, free surface flow in nature may generally be considered fully turbulent and rough, with little or no effect from the impact of lateral inflow. Unlike laminar flow, however, even when it is steady and uniform, there is no exact solution available for turbulent flow. As was the case for the analogous turbulence closure problem in the atmosphere discussed in Chapter 2, the main difficulty here is the presence of the second moments of the velocity fluctuations, that is the Reynolds determine) this unknown shear stress is either to invoke similarity theory or to rely entirely on empirical results. Similarity for two-dimensional turbulent flow Uniform two-dimensional turbulent flow can be considered as a fully developed boundary layer. For rough flow conditions, which are usually the case for flow over a natural land- surface, the velocity profile in the inner region of the neutral boundary layer is given by Equations (2.40) or (2.41). Strictly speaking, one can apply this logarithmic profile only in water on the land surface thelower10%to20%oftheboundarylayerthickness;intheouterreachesoftheboundary layer, some type of velocity defect law is more appropriate. However, in two-dimensional free surface flow this defect law (see, for example, Keulegan, 1938) is often assumed to be (cid:3) (cid:4) ln (5.34) which implies that Equation (2.40) can be used over the whole depth of the flow. This is apparently only an approximation, but in laboratory type turbulent boundary layers the difference between Equations (2.40) or (5.34) and observed velocity profiles in the outer velocity can be expressed roughly (for ) as ln (5.35) or (when also ), As an aside, it should be mentioned that one possible problem with the application of V/(gh)1/2 (2.40) to open channel flow is that may be a function of Froude number Fr of water flowing down a slope may also be affected by gravity, g, beside the variables that were considered in the derivation of Equation (2.40). A second potential difficulty is the effect of the raindrop impact. For instance, Kisisel (1973) showed that for shallow flows with values around 15 mm and a high rainfall intensity of 125 mm the measured velocity profiles (u were logarithmic, but the resulting values would be only about half the magnitude predicted by (5.36). For less shallow flows, however, the effect of rainfall impact is likely to be small.

Empirical equations Most empirical equations derived from uniform steady flow measurements are of the where is a resistance factor, which ideally depends only on the nature of the channel, and and are constants; is the hydraulic radius defined as in which is the cross-sectional area of the channel, and the wetted perimeter of that area. In two-dimensional flow situations and wide channels, the hydraulic radius equals the depth of the flow, or h. Example 5.2 This can be seen in the case of a channel with a trapezoidal cross section with a water depth h, a bottom width and a water surface width (see Figure 5.4); according to (5.40), this has a hydraulic radius which approaches as both and become large (compared to h) and practically equal to each other. Probably the oldest form of open channel equation (5.39) is the one developed in France by Ch´ ezy around 1770 in which (Mouret, 1921). Numerous expres- sions have been proposed for (see Chow, 1959, p. 94, for a review). Some insight can begainedinthenatureofC ,bycomparingCh´ ezy’sequationwiththemoretheoretically based expressions for turbulent flow. It can be seen from the similarity expression for wide channels (5.36), that in the Ch´ ezy equation the resistance factor is given by = ) 1]; this indicates that depends not only on the roughness but also on the hydraulic radius. It can also be seen from the power function expression water on the land surface Sometypicalvaluesoftheroughnesscoefficientnfornaturalchannels Table5.1 Channel type Earth, straight, with short vegetation 0.02–0.03 Gravel bed, straight 0.03–0.04 Earth and gravel, winding with some weeds on banks 0.03–0.05 Sand and gravel bed with boulders or with brush and overhanging 0.035–0.06 trees on banks Boulders and banks of exposed rock 0.05–0.08 Earth overgrown with weeds 0.07–0.09 the velocity is uniform along the vertical. This suggests that for a given channel can only be truly constant for highly turbulent flow, or for very high Reynolds numbers Another very popular formula is the Gauckler–Manning (GM) equation, named after the two engineers who contributed most to its development (see Powell, 1962; 1968; Williams, 1970; 1971). It is usually written as S1/2 R2/3 The constant is referred to as the channel roughness coefficient, when the variables are expressed in SI units. Numerous experiments have been carried out to determine it for all kinds of channels and surfaces. Some values are shown in Table 5.1, but more detailed results for a wider range of conditions can be found in Chow (1959) and in be derived theoretically by assuming a power law such as (5.37) with This indicatesthattheGMformulacanbeexpectedtobevalidoverarangeoflowerReynolds numbers than Ch´ ezy’s, which requires the extreme value 0 for a perfectly uniform velocity profile. Equation (5.38) also shows that is directly proportional to ; it should be recalled from Section 2.5.2 that, as a first approximation, may be assumed to be of the order of one tenth of the size of the roughness elements of the wall. In any event, the power law assumption, on which the GM equation is implicitly based, should be adequate for most practical applications. This is illustrated in Figure 5.5, which gives a comparison between the dependence of the average velocity on the water depth ), as calculated with the logarithmic profile (5.36) and that calculated with the power profile (5.38). The two curves display satisfactory agreement for the value of the constant Comparison of the GM equation (5.41) with (5.38) produces then the following relationship between the channel roughness coefficient and the boundary layer roughness height, 0.0690z1/6 in which is expressed in metres. friction slope Fig.5.5 Comparisonbetweenthe averagestreamvelocity describedbythelogarithmic equation(5.36)(heavyline)and bythepowerequation(5.38) (thinline).Theconstantsinthe powerequationarem 0 10 15 20 V/(gS h) TheequationsofCh´ ezyandGauckler–Manningsuggestthata in(5.39)normallylies in a range between 0.5 and 0.7 under fully turbulent flow conditions.

In some studies of high Reynolds number sheet flow over surfaces covered with short vegetation, such as grass, it has been concluded that a, as the power of h, may have an intermediate value close to unity. Horton (1938) adopted 1 to derive the rising hydrograph; he conjectured that this might represent a flow that is 75% turbulent and 25% laminar. Horner and Jens (1942) derivedthisvalueofa 1fromexperimentaldatabydifferentinvestigators.Ananalysis by Henderson and Wooding (1964) of data published by Hicks (1944) confirmed that may indeed be close to unity over a very rough or grass-covered surface. Wooding (1965) interpreted this phenomenon by noting that, owing to fluctuations in depth and roughness over an irregular surface, the flow regime can vary spatially and temporally between laminar and turbulent; in addition, even when the flow near the water surface is turbulent, the flow within the lower layers between the grass stems and leaves may be more like laminar seepage through a porous medium."}

The form of Equation (5.51) describes actually two waves, each with a speed of prop- agation (relative to a reference moving with the fluid velocity of the undisturbed flow), but traveling in opposite directions. To distinguish the speed of propagation of a disturbance or of a wave, from the velocity of the fluid itself, it is common to refer to it as celerity. As an illustration, consider now the case where represents the water surface elevation , which is the easiest to visualize. In this case, initially at 0, the function (x )definesawatersurfaceconfiguration (x );atalatertimet it F t h F t 1 m 0 m p 1 m m m1 describes the configuration (x ).

Consider a wide uniform channel extending to from the (moving) origin at 0.Assumeasinitialconditionsthatthevariable f(x )andalsoitstimederivative (∂y/∂t = ) g(x ) are known for any value of .

Thus the solution (5.51) can be written for this case as m 0 m m 0 m which is commonly attributed to d’Alembert. This result (5.54) is equally applicable to the water surface depth , the velocity and the rate of flow . However, in each case the functions f(x ) and g(x ) should represent the initial conditions of the intended variable. Example 5.4. Infinitely long channel with zero initial time derivative If the value of the time derivative of the variable in question is initially equal to zero, or = −c )+ +c f(x f(x ) (5.55) m 0 m m 0 m As an illustration, consider the following function to describe the initial disturbance, = α 1+10x2 f(x ) (5.56) In this expression is a constant, which should be large to ensure that the perturbation is small, compared to the undisturbed part of the variable, i.e. or , describing the steadyuniformflow.Withthisinitialcondition,thesolutionis,inaccordancewithEquation y(x ) (5.57) m m m 0 m m 0 m = 0, 0.4, This solution is shown in Figure 5.7 for the values 0.2, 0.8 and 1.2, and illustrates the propagation of the disturbance with time, relative to the reference point 0, which is moving with the velocity .

Semi-infinite channel with known upstream inflow A situation which has been the subject of many studies is that of a channel reach, with a given inflow at its upstream end. If the upstream end is taken as the origin, where 0, the boundary and initial conditions can be written as 0;x 0;t 0 These conditions can now be used with Equation (5.49) to solve the problem. However, rather than to attempt a frontal attack, it is convenient here to make use of the d’Alembert solution (5.58) for the unit impulse derived in the previous example, and by inspection of Figure 5.7. This shows immediately that the component of that solution moving to the left away from 0 can be considered an image, and that the component moving into the domain 0 is the desired result. Thus one has the unit response function, that is the solution for an input at 0, )t) (5.60) If the input at 0 is actually (t) instead of a delta function, the solution can be readily obtained by convolution. For instance, in the case where y(t) represents the flow general considerations rate disturbance , the solution resulting from an inflow (t) at 0 is )(t (5.61) or, upon integration, (t )) (5.62) To repeat briefly the results of this section, general solutions of the dynamic part of the shallow water equations result in two waves; their speed of propagation (gh relative to the mean motion, is also known as Lagrange’s celerity equation (cf. Equation (5.50)). One of these “dynamic” waves is moving in the direction of the current and the other against the current. Thus two observers, one moving downstream with a velocity ≡ +c ≡ −c (V ) and the other with a velocity against the current (V ), would 01 0 0 02 0 0 seethesmalldisturbanceasastationary,i.e.non-moving,displacementofthesurfacefrom equilibrium.Recallinthiscontext,thattheratioV definestheFroudenumberforsteady uniform flow, that is Fr (5.63) Therefore, when 0, or Fr 1, the flow is subcritical and this disturbance (or the observer) actually moves upstream; when 0, the flow is supercritical, and while this disturbance still moves against the current, it is smaller than and is thus swept down- stream. The paths of these two observers traced on the plane are called characteristics. From the above analysis it follows that these characteristics can be defined by the ordinary differential equations = +(gh = and (5.64) = −(gh = The concept of characteristics, which is being introduced here in an offhand way, arises formally in the theory of partial differential equations. However, this is beyond the scope of the present discussion. For an introduction to the mathematics, the reader is referred to such books as Sommerfeld (1949), and on the application of characteristics to free surface flow to Stoker (1957) or Abbott (1975). Solutions of complete system: two types of wave If the last term in the second of Equations (5.44) is not neglected, it must also be expressed in terms of the initial steady uniform flow variables and their perturbations; making use of f p 0 p 0 water on the land surface or, neglecting higher-order terms, f 0 0 p 0 p 0 forwhichvaluesofa andbcanbetakenfromTable5.2.Inmanyapplicationsinhydrology, the discharge rate is of greater interest than the water depth or the velocity V.

The solution (5.72) consists of two wave like motions that modify the steady uniform .Thefirstpart,givenbyEquation(5.73),isidenticaltothesolutionoftheanalogous dynamic case given in (5.60), except that it also contains an exponential decay term in x. This part retains the form of a delta function and the argument of this delta function shows that it has the celerity of a dynamic wave, namely the same as given by Equation (5.60) or thefirstof(5.64).Theamplitudeofu decreasesexponentially,providedd 0.However, a−1,thewavegrowsexponentially;thisisthewell-known whend 0,thatiswhenFr > > 3/2(inthecase criterionforboreformation,namelyFr 2(inthecaseofCh´ ezy)orFr exp[−S x/(Fr = of GM).

Interestingly, a very similar result was obtained by an analysis of the 1957, p. 505), who showed that the dynamic front of any surface disturbance decays as exp(−gS t/V ), for small Froude numbers. The second part, given by Equation (5.74), constitutes the main body of the wave. Mathematically, the Heaviside step function eliminates singularities from this part of the solution. Physically, the unit step function guarantees that this part will never forge ahead fasterorfurtherthanthepositionofthedynamicfront t),givenbyEquation(5.73), and it ensures that the first part given by (5.73) represents indeed the leading edge of the disturbance caused by the unit impulse at 0. The celerity of the main body of the wave can be determined from the mean travel time of the wave. This mean time of occurrence m(cid:2) of a wave is the first moment about the origin, denoted as or this is also called its centroid or center of area. Therefore, the travel time is the difference between the mean time of occurrence of the wave at the point of observation and that at the origin 0, that is the time for its center of gravity to reach x. The upstream inflow at 0 is given by a delta function, whose first moment about the origin is zero. Therefore, mathematically the (x,t)aboutt =0foragiven meantraveltimeisthefirstmomentoftheoutflowrateq x,or m(cid:2) = tq(x,t)dt The Laplace transform of (5.72) can be used as a moment generating function (Dooge, 1973). Accordingly, the first moment is the first derivative of the Laplace transform at the origin in the transform domain, and it can be readily shown that it is given by m(cid:2) x/m(cid:2) This yields a celerity for the main body of the disturbance For reasons which will become clear in Section 5.4.3, a wave with a celerity [(1 is referredtoasakinematicwave;Equation(5.77)representsitslinearizedform,asindicated by the 0 subscript. general considerations 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 t /(e x ) Fig.5.8 Dimensionlessrepresentationofthesecondpartoftheunitresponsefunction = /(S0V0)fortheupstreaminflowproblem,asobtainedbysolutionofthelinearized u+2 h0u2 completeshallowwaterequations.Eachcurveisshownasafunctionoftimet+ atdifferent distances downstreamfromthereleasepointoftheunitimpulse.Thevaluesoftheordinate andtheabscissaaremultipliedanddivided,respectively,by(e2x+)toallowconvenient = /(Fr0 +1)andtheFroude comparisonbetweenthethreecurves.Theconstantise2 numberistakenasFr0 Severalfeaturesofthesolutioncanbebroughtoutinamoregeneralwaybyconsidering it in a similarity framework.

For example, it was noted by Iwasaki (1967), that in the upper Kitakami, a river some 195 km long draining an area of 7860 in northern Honshu, these inertia terms were observed to be at most 1.5%, and usually smaller than 1% of the stage gradient ]. Similarly, the following values were presented in the (Natural Environment Flood Studies Report Research Council, 1975) as being typical for British rivers. ∼ 0.9 ∼ × ∼ ∼ 1.7 × Recall that the governing equations of free surface flow describe the conservation of massandtheconservationofmomentum.Inthissectiontheconsequencesareconsidered of neglecting these inertia terms in the momentum equations (5.22) or (5.25).

This is readily obtained from (5.87) by proceeding as before in Section 5.4.1; thus, decompose the variables into a uniform steady part and a perturbation, or and , and retain only the first-order terms, to obtain ∂q ∂q ∂2q ∂t ∂x ∂x2 This is a linear diffusion equation, in which the constant diffusivity is (cid:3) (cid:4) with for turbulent flow, and the constant advectivity is Inalineardiffusionchannel,thisadvectivityisclearlythesameasthecelerity(a 1)V of the main body of the wave of the complete linear solution, given by Equation (5.77). This will become clear in Section 5.4.3, but it can already be verified by determining the advectivity of the diffusion equation is also the kinematic wave celerity , or The linear diffusion formulation in (5.88) was derived for a very wide channel; for a channelcrosssection withaflowrate ,thebasicequation A A A Q Q Q c c0 cp 0 p can be written as ∂Q ∂Q ∂2Q ∂t ∂x ∂x2 which is the linearized form of (5.87). The diffusivity is now (cid:3) (cid:4) and the advectivity is, in light of (5.91), This can again be approximated by (a 1)V , if the channel is wide enough. The diffusion approximation of free surface flow has been the subject of numerous upstream boundary of the channel at 0 and a nonzero lateral inflow has comparisonwiththesolutionofthecompleteshallowwaterequations,consideragainthe same example as before with zero lateral inflow and with a known value of the upstream inflow (t). general considerations Example 5.7. Semi-infinite channel with known upstream inflow Inthediffusionapproachthegoverningequationisnow(5.88),buttheboundaryconditions the complete formulation in Section 5.4.1, the solution of the linear diffusion analogy is most conveniently given by its unit response. This is the outflow rate at a distance downstream from the point 0 where the flow rate perturbation is a delta function or (t) The unit response can then be used with (5.71) to calculate the result for any arbitrary function (t). The diffusion equation has been thoroughly studied (see, for example, Carslaw and Jaeger, 1986) for various boundary conditions. It can be readily shown that this unit response function can be written as (cid:3) (cid:4) exp (5.95) This solution has a form which is closely related to the Gaussian or normal distribution in which the position of the mean is (c t) and the spatial variance (2D t). Thus this unit response confirms that the main body of this wave, that is its centroid, moves downstream with a celerity, given by the advectivity of Equation (5.91). It also shows how the diffusivity causes dispersion or spreading of the wave as it moves along. To generalize this result it is useful to express it in terms of the dimensionless variables respectively, yields (cid:25) (cid:26) (cid:5) (cid:6) exp (5.96) 2πt3 2t+ ThissolutionofthediffusionapproachiscomparedinFigure5.9withthemainunitresponse in the analogous solution of the complete shallow water equations, as given in (5.80).

Finally, Figure 5.9 illustrates how for small values of the volume under the curve is smaller than unity; for instance, the curve at is lower than the corresponding diffusion result. This merely illustrates the fact that for small values of the dynamic wave part is still not negligible; for instance, as mentioned above, at in Equation (5.79) the term x+) is still 0.411; but it rapidly decays with increasing x+. Themainpointofthisanalysisofthediffusionanalogyoffreesurfaceflowisthatithas further illustrated how the inertia terms, i.e. the first two terms in Equation (5.22) which represent acceleration, are the ones that generate the dynamic waves, shown in (5.64) and themainbodyofthewaveisessentiallycontrolledbythelastthreetermsofEquation(5.22); both the solution of the complete system and that of the diffusion analogy indicate that the main body moves with the celerity of a kinematic wave; this will be further discussed in Section 5.4.3. water on the land surface 0 5 10 15 = /(S0V0)fortheupstreaminflow Comparisonbetweentheunitresponsefunctionu+2 h0u2 = h0u/(S0V0) problem,obtainedwiththecompleteshallowwaterequations(solidline)andu+ obtainedwiththediffusionapproximation(thinline).Eachunitresponsecurveisshownasa functionoftimet+ x+ atdifferentdistances downstreamfromthereleasepointoftheunit = 2/3andtheFroudenumberistakenasFr0 = 0.5.Theshallow impulse.Theconstantisa waterresultsfor 5and20arethesameasthoseshownin Figure5.8.

This way it can be seen that it is mainly the third term in (5.22), namely which is responsible for the diffusion character of the resulting equation. Indeed, when this third term is also omitted, the resulting formulation loses its diffusion character, as will be shown in Section 5.4.3. However, it should be noted that this is not the only way to obtain a linear diffusion equation for free surface flow. It is also possible to start from the complete linear system (5.67) and to modify (rather than eliminate) the second derivatives involving time by means of the quasi-steady- uniform flow or kinematic wave assumption (see Section 5.4.3; also Brutsaert, 1973). As will become clear below (see Equation (5.118)) this assumption allows the substitution (a in the second derivatives involving time in (5.67). This leads then to a diffusion equation with a diffusivity, different from (5.89), namely (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) = 1−a2Fr2 or, for a channel of width , (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) = 1−a2Fr2 InthecaseoftheupstreaminflowtreatedinExample5.7,theunitresponse(5.96)becomes with this improved diffusivity (cid:27) (cid:28) (cid:5) (cid:6) exp (5.99) 2π 1−a2Fr2 general considerations 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 = h0u/(S0V0)fortheupstreaminflow Comparisonbetweentheunitresponsefunctionu+ Fig.5.10 problem,obtainedwiththecompleteshallowwaterequations(1)andobtainedwiththe diffusionapproximation(2and3).Thecurvesindicatedby2areobtainedwiththediffusivity = /S0 = /S0 D0 bq0 D0 bq0 andthoseindicatedby3with .Eachunitresponse curveisshownasafunctionoftimet+ x+ atdifferentdistances downstreamfromtherelease = 2/3andtheFroudenumberistakenas pointoftheunitimpulse.Theconstantisa = 0.5.Someofthecurvesindicatedby1and3arealsoshownin Fr0 Figures5.8and5.9.

{"text": "5.4.3 The quasi-steady-uniform flow approach: a second approximation It was indicated earlier (see (5.81), for example) that typically the first three terms magnitude smaller than those representing the effects of gravity and of friction, namely and . In the previous section the dynamic terms were omitted, but the term was kept in the formulation, and this was shown to lead to the diffusion analogy. Often, however, under conditions that turn out to be quite common in nature, it is possible to neglect that term as well, and to keep only and . In other words, it is assumed that water flows downhill but it is prevented from accelerating or decelerating very much, because the frictional resistance of the bed is overwhelming all other factors. Thus following This is the basis of the so-called quasi-steady-uniform flow or kinematic wave approxi- water on the land surface The kinematic wave approach for free surface flow In view of the form of the various expressions for the friction slope discussed in Section 5.3, Equation (5.100) is tantamount to assuming that, at a given location along the flow channel, the average velocity is a function of the hydraulic radius only, V(R ) (5.101) For a given cross section, the hydraulic radius is uniquely related to the mean depth of flow and to the cross-sectional area; thus can also be expressed as a function of one of those variables, and one can use as well. As before, the most important features of the flow can be deduced by considering a widechannel.Equation(5.102),whichnowrepresentsthemomentumequation,indicates that the flow rate per unit width (Vh) is a function of only; thus, the continuity equation (5.13) can be written as this in Equation (5.13) one obtains in a similar manner Equations (5.103) and (5.104) both have a structure, which is similar to that of the total time derivative of and of q, namely Hence it follows that defines a wave speed; for the sake of conciseness this can be denoted by , so The speed of this wave represents the rate of displacement of any point along x, where the depth (or the cross-sectional area) and the rate of flow increase respectively as and (5.109) general considerations respectively,showsthattoanimaginaryobserver,movingalongx withavelocitydefined by (5.108) and (5.107), it would appear that the cross-sectional area and the flow rate change as indicated by (5.109). In the absence of lateral inflow, when 0, the velocity where 0, that is the speed of propagation of points of a given value of and q. These observations are somewhat similar to the comments made in connection with defines the characteristics of the problem. Because (5.103) and (5.104) are of the first order, there is only one set of characteristics, namely in the forward direction.

However, when the cross section does not have a wide (a 1) (5.114) where is the width of the channel at the water surface; is the rate of increase in the wetted perimeter with depth, which is zero for a wide channel. Apparently, the quasi-steady-uniform flow approximation has been used as early as 1857byKleitz(1877,p.172)andhisfellowengineersontheRhoneRiver,andbyBreton in 1867 (Forchheimer, 1930). Equation (5.108) was also applied successfully with gage heights on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers by Seddon (1900); it is now sometimes referred to as the Kleitz–Seddon law. The full implications of the approximation were investigated by Lighthill and Whitham (1955). They called the wave motion kinematic, becauseitarisesfromtheeliminationofthedynamicaspectsofthemomentumequation, namely the first three terms of Equation (5.22), leading to the assumption of (5.101) and (5.102). water on the land surface Significance of the approximation their amplitude. Thus in general, small forerunners of a disturbance move with veloci- ties given approximately by (5.64). However, as a result of gravity and friction, the main part of the disturbance usually moves with a much smaller velocity, namely as given by is large, the dynamic waves are damped sufficiently that the kinematic waves, which usu- ally move at a slower speed, assume the dominant role. It is under such conditions that Equations (5.105) and (5.106) describe the flow. As will be shown in Chapters 6 and 7, the kinematic wave approach is useful in the solution of several problems of practical interest. Solution of the linearized equation Asbefore,whenthedisturbancesaroundasteadyuniformreferenceflowarenotexcessive, one can decompose the variables into an undisturbed part and a perturbation, and the continuity equation is the first of (5.66), rewritten here for convenience Accordingto(5.43)with(5.100),therateofflowcanbewrittenintermsofthedecomposed variables as (cid:3) (cid:4) +q = + = 1+ 0 p r 0 p 0 Hence, because , and presumably , one can write q V h h h 0 0 0 p 0 (a (5.116) or, alternatively as a total time derivative of , as (a (5.120) As anticipated, this result is the same as the celerities given by (5.77) and (5.91). general considerations Thisresultwasobtainedforawidechannelofrectangularcrosssection;forothercross- sectional geometries, one can formulate the rate of flow in terms of decomposed variables in a way similar to Equation (5.116), namely )a+1(P )−a Q Q C A P 0 p r c0 cp w0 wp Again, because and , one obtains the analog of (5.116) cp c0 wp w0 = +1) −aQ (a (5.121) p 0 cp 0 With the equation of continuity one can, as before, define a celerity, (dQ ) which now assumes the form (a (5.122) /dA = /dA Note that this result shows that also here (dQ ) (dQ ). p cp 0 c0 Example 5.8.

But it should be remembered that this represents a disturbance over and above the steady uniform flow ."}

{"text": "6.2.2 Steady lateral inflow When the lateral inflow remains constant with time, there are two phases of hydrologic interest. The first is the buildup of the flow on a plane that is initially dry in accordance with Equation (6.3); the second is the subsidence of the flow after the lateral inflow has ceased and 0.

Because can assume any value over the length of the plane 0 L, there is an infinity of characteristics on which (6.17) is valid, each depending on . The boundary characteristic starting at 0, is however of special interest. On that particular characteristic (6.17) assumes the form (K (6.19) = = thex−t Thus on this particular characteristic starting at 0 and 0 in plane, i.e. at 0 and 0 on the physical plane, both (6.16) and (6.19) hold. This trajectory on the plane is shown in Figure 6.4 as going from 0 to A , A , etc., for different values of t. For all the other characteristics, at values larger than given by the water depth as a function of time, independently of . Therefore, downstream Actually, Equations (6.18) and (6.19) also represent the continuity condition that must be satisfied under equilibrium conditions, that is when the flow rate at any point equals the total lateral inflow upstream from that point. This means that equilibrium conditions are established upstream from any point where the boundary characteristic has passed and that the entire plane is at equilibrium as soon as that characteristic has overland flow namely 0 L. The time required to reach this steady state equilibrium is obtained by combining (6.16) with (6.19) at L, or ia)1/(a+1) When the duration of lateral inflow exceeds the time to equilibrium, the outflow hydro- graph at can be readily obtained. Prior to the time to equilibrium, it is obtained from(6.8)combinedwith(6.16);onceequilibriumisestablisheditcanbeobtainedfrom (6.18). Thus the rising hydrograph at is given by (cid:11) ia+1ta+1 Equation (6.21) is the main result of this section. The performance of (6.20) has been compared with experimental data on turbulent sheet flow from the literature by McCuen and Spiess (1995); they concluded that its use should be restricted by the criterion To generalize the result shown in Equation (6.21), it is useful to express it in terms of dimensionless variables. The simplest way to proceed here is to take the equilibrium discharge rate (iL) from the plane and the time to equilibrium as scaling variables. This reduces Equation (6.21) to (cid:11) wherenowq (q ) and in which (iL)istheequilibriumout- flow rate at L; this rising hydrograph is illustrated in Figure 6.5. Figures 6.6 and 6.7 show a comparison between the kinematic wave rising hydrograph and experimental data of Izzard (1944, 1946) scaled in the same manner. It can be seen that some of the hydrographs in Figure 6.6 initially start out as laminar flow, and change to turbulent = 0.4; = 0.9 flow later on around also, around some dynamic effects, which are neglected in the kinematic formulation, appear to enter into play. Decay phase: recession hydrograph after rain stops = (dh/dt) = As soon as 0, according to Equation (6.10) one has 0. Hence, to the observer moving at a celerity given by (6.11) it now appears that remains constant. In other words, (6.11) is the velocity of a point of the water surface with the given value of h. Thus on the plane the characteristics describe straight lines parallel to the surface of the plane where 0. One such characteristic is shown in Figure 6.8, as going from A to A , A , etc., for successive values of time after the lateral inflow has ceased. Because remains constant, Equation (6.11) can be integrated immediately to yield (a 1) (6.23) where is the starting value of x, i.e. its initial value at the time 0, when the rain stops and the recession starts.

Thus Equation (6.24) assumes the form (a (6.25) where is defined behind (6.22); the dimensionless water depth is ) in which the equilibrium depth at the outlet is in accordance with (6.19).

Under conditions of turbulent flow this assumption may be a good approximation but, as seen in Table 5.2, under conditions of laminar flow the additional resistance may be considerable. This effect can be incorporated in the recession analysis as follows. Let denote the parameter in Equation (6.8) under conditions of rainfall impact, and the same parameter in the absence of rain. Both respectively.

With the expressions given in Table 5.2, this increased flow rate is roughly (1 times the equilibrium flow rate iL; for instance, with a slope = 0.001 = 0.3 and a rainfall intensity cm , this indicates a sudden increase of 38%. But in actual flow situations this sudden increase is unlikely to be that large, and the value predicted by Equation (6.37) can only be considered as an upper limit. Indeed, a sudden change in shear stress resulting from the cessation of the rainfall, must also involve accelerations, which are neglected in the kinematic approach leading to (6.37), and which will tend to offset this effect. Moreover, even if it were to occur, the spike is rapidly dissipated. Finally, natural rainfall events never cease suddenly, but they tend to decrease rather gradually. Brief increases in runoff, upon the cessation of rainfall have beenobservedexperimentallyandreportedbyIzzard(1946),buttheyweremuchsmaller than those predicted here by Equation (6.37)."}

Figure 6.11 illustrates that the lumped kinematic approach does not really produce a verygoodmathematicaldescriptionofoverlandflow,ascomparedwiththekinematicwave solution, which is known to provide a close approximation to the exact solution. Thus the question can be raised how the experimental results could be described so well by the lumped approach in Izzard’s (1946) study. The explanation of this discrepancy proba- bly lies in the method used to scale the experimental rising hydrographs.

The word refers in general to the mathematical procedure of tracking or following water movement from one place to another; as such, the word also includes the description of the conversion of precipitation into various subsurface and surface runoff phenomena. However, refers specifically to the streamflow routing description of the behavior of a flood wave as it moves along in a well-defined open channel. In practical terms, the problem consists of the determination of the discharge hydrograph Q(t) at a given point along a stream, from a known hydrograph fur- ther up- or downstream and from a knowledge of the physical characteristics of the channel. The wave may be the result of inflows into the channel following various events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, failure or overtopping of natural or artificial dams due to landslides or earthquakes, tidal interactions and releases from artificial reservoirs. Over the years different methods have evolved. The more fundamental approaches are based on hydraulic theory of open channel flow and consist of ad-hoc solutions of some form of the complete shallow water equations by numerical techniques on digital computer.

{"text": "7.1.1 Surge or dynamic shock Under certain conditions the water surface exhibits an obvious and visible disturbance, alsovariouslycalledanabruptwave,asurge,aboreoramovinghydraulicjump.Similar phenomena occur in other situations in the environment as well, and they constitute the front of what are broadly referred to as gravity currents (Simpson, 1997). For instance, in Chapter 3 analogous surges were seen to occur as the gust front of thunderstorms (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9). Any such disturbance may be interpreted, if not as a discontinuity, at least as a point where the water depth is not a smooth function; this interpretation means that the of the flow around such a wave, whether it will amplify or decay. As already noted in Chapter 5 on the basis of the solution of the linear case, the criterion for bore formation However, the instantaneous speed of propagation of such a wave depends solely on the magnitude of the discontinuity itself, as will now be shown. Types of abrupt wave In general, there are four different types of abrupt wave. A simple way of visualizing them makes use of a thought experiment illustrated in Figure 7.1. Consider a sluice gateunderwell-establishedsteadyflowconditions,whoseopeningissuddenlychanged. If the gate is raised, the downstream flow can be seen to develop situation A and the upstream flow develops situation C. If the sudden change is downward, situations B and D develop, respectively upstream and downstream from the gate. Waves in class A move downstream as positive surges; these types of bore are the ones of primary interest in hydrology, as they can transport large amounts of water and have caused some major flooding events in the past. Waves of type B are also positive surges, but in contrast to A, they advance upstream. They are typical for tidal bores, which are observed in some estuaries and rivers affected by tidal action. Such bores can be formed when the rising tide reverses the river flow and the tidal water enters into a gradually narrowing and shallowing channel, usually with a small bed slope; this narrowing environment slows down the leading edge of the tide, and allows it to be overtaken by the deeper and faster traveling water of the continually rising tide coming up from the rear. Although the survey was not totally exhaustive, at last count (Bartsch-Winkler and Lynch, 1988), streamflow routing Fig.7.1 Generationofthefourdifferenttypesofabruptwavebythesuddenmovementofthesluicegate.

Waves of type C are upstream moving negative surges, which have on occasion been observed in hydropower supply canals, when the water demand is drastically stepped up. Waves of type D are downstream moving negative surges, which can result on occasion from a suddenly decreased water supply in an open channel. Aswillbeseenbelow,wavestravelfasterindeeperwaterthaninshallowwater.Inthe positive surges of type A and B, which result in a higher water surface, the deeper water tends to overtake the more shallow leading edge water; therefore, the surge maintains itself and can be considered stable.

In spite of these differences, the initial stages of all four types of waves can be analyzed in the same way, as will be shown next. Analysis of flood wave The problem is most easily analyzed from a reference moving at the same velocity as thewave,sothatthephenomenonbecomesoneofsteadystate.Onemaythusassumethat and become functions of a single variable (x t) , and the partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives as follows = = −c = = and (7.1) ∂t dξ ∂t dξ ∂x dξ ∂x dξ BecausethevelocityVanddepthhvarymarkedlyandabruptlyacrossthewave,theinertia and hydrostatic pressure gradient terms are predominant in the momentum equation and, as a first approximation, the friction term and the gravity term can both be neglected. In the absence of lateral inflow, the momentum equation for a wide channel, (5.22), becomes then with (7.1) −(c − + = V) 0 (7.2) Upon multiplication by (h ) and integration between two points 1 and 2, respectively, some small but finite distance upstream and downstream from the abrupt wave (see Figure 7.2), Equation (7.2) assumes the form (cid:2) (cid:2) − − dξ + dξ (c V) (7.3) Thesameoperationscanbeappliedtothecontinuityequationforawidechannel,(5.13), streamflow routing After integration across the wave, this becomes in turn (c V) constant or (7.5) (c ) (c )h s 1 1 s 2 2 part of the first term in (7.3) is independent of Therefore after taking that part outside the integral sign, (7.3) becomes (cid:3) (cid:4) − − + − = s 1 1 1 2 Equation (7.5) can also be used to eliminate from (7.6); after substitution of s s 1 1 2 (cid:5) (cid:6) The square root term in Equation (7.7) represents the celerity of the bore relative to the velocityatcrosssection1.Becauseofsymmetry,thesubscripts1and2inEquation(7.7) can be interchanged, to yield the celerity relative to the velocity at section 2. Whenever sections 1 and 2 are defined respectively as the section upstream and the downstream from the abrupt wave, the plus sign in Equation (7.7) describes the downstream motion of surges of type A and D, and the minus sign upstream moving surges of type B and C. Thus flood waves, as encountered in hydrology require the plus sign in (7.7).

Disastrous floods Abrupt waves of type A have been associated with some extreme flooding events in the past. For instance, in the United States, the Johnstown flood is still among the largest natural disasters on record (see McCullough, 1968; Degen and Degen, 1984). The flood two extreme cases Fig.7.3 ThebrokenSouthForkdam,asseenfrominsidetheemptyreservoir.Theopeningwasabout130m widenearthetop;thespillwaycanbeseenontherightjustbelowthebridge.Ittookthefloodsurge roughly53mintoreachJohnstown.DrawingbySchellandHogan.(FromHarper’sWeekly,1889.) took place in the afternoon of May 31, 1889, after a night of heavy rain, and was caused by the failure of a badly maintained dam on South Fork Creek, some 23 km upstream along the Little Conemaugh River and some 135 m higher than the town itself. After the 15 m in some places, raged down the valley; as it reached Johnstown (at 1607), in a little less than an hour, it spread out somewhat over a wider area, but its center was still at least 10 m high. While the main event in Johnstown was over in 10 min, it left more than 2200 dead in its aftermath and near total destruction of the city. Example 7.1. Some features of the Johnstown flood Interestingly, the reported features of the Johnstown flood are not unreasonable in light of Equation (7.7), and some of them can be reconstructed with a few rough estimates of the effective parameters. Dam breach problems like this are highly unsteady in nature, and they have been the subject of intensive study (see, for example, Yevjevich, 1975). However, assume for the present example that the reservoir was large enough, resulting in a steady inflow into the river channel after the dam had failed. From the eyewitness accounts, the height of the surge appears to have been of the order of 10 m. With a = (135/23000) = mean slope of and an assumed roughness of 0.07 (see Table 5.1), Equation (5.41) yields a velocity of the water behind the surge of 5.08 m streamflow routing Assuming also (as a first approximation) that the valley cross-sectional area did not vary appreciably along the flow path, and (for want of better information) that in the valley ahead of the surge the effective water depth was of the order of 1.0 m, according to Equation (7.7) one finds that the surge came down at 7.4 m thus, it would have taken the wave about 52 min to cover the 23 km, which in fact it did. Admittedly, this result is obtained with unknown and therefore assumed values of and , and it would be possible to obtain the same value of with other equally plausible combinations. For instance, roughly the same result would be obtained with assumed values of 0.05 and 0 m, representing a smoother channel with negligible depth of flow prior to the disaster (cf. Problem 7.1). It would require a more detailed field survey and analysis to estimate which values of n, and would be appropriate for the dam-break event that took place in this valley. A notorious but less disastrous flash flood occurred on Willow Creek in the town of HeppnerinOregon,inthelateafternoononSundayJune14,1903.AccordingtoMorrow County records (see also Taylor and Hatton, 1999), it was generated by a cloudburst, which was later estimated to amount to about 35 mm over an area of some 50 mainly around Balm Fork, in the hills 10–15 km south of town. The flood waters raced into town around 1700, causing the death of some 247 inhabitants, nearly 20% of the population, and destroying one third of all structures. The of June 18, Heppner Gazette wall of water, 40 feet in height.” This surge height may well have been an overestimate. Without detailed information on the temporal and spatial distribution of that rainfall event, it is hard to know exactly how the runoff was funneled into a surge in the Willow Creek valley. Nevertheless, the suddenness and power of the flood were no doubt also exacerbated by the presence of a laundry at the upstream end of town; combined with accumulating debris, this structure at first blocked passage of the water somewhat, only to give way after a short while, abruptly releasing the built-up water mass. Other examples of this type of flood are the glacier lake outbursts caused by ice avalanches in Peru, where they are known as aluvi´ ones (see Lliboutry al., 1977; Morales-Arnao, 1999). Typically, they are triggered with almost no warning and bring down ice blocks, boulders and mud, leaving death and destruction in their path. In the past three centuries more than 22 major outburst floods have destroyed a number of towns and villages in the region. In 1941 one such aluvi´ on, caused by the failure of a moraine dam higher up in the Cordillera Blanca, destroyed about one third of the city of Huaraz and resulted in an estimated 5000–7000 deaths."}

Itsrateof propagationisgiven byEquation(7.9). are frictional resistance and gravity. It is often considered the kinematic equivalent of the dynamic shock, because the wave front constitutes a moving transition between two regions of essentially uniform flow. Again, the problem can be analyzed within a reference frame moving at the same equation, or In a perfect kinematic system this result suggests a discontinuity in or in its deriva- tive, because in order to keep a constant, must also be constant, even though q(h) is nonlinear. This is the reason why the monoclinal rising wave has also been referred to as a kinematic shock. In actual rivers, however, flood rises, which are subject mainly (but never only) to the effects of gravity and friction, usually do not display any such discontinuities and they are quite continuous and smooth; they usually extend over large distances and the transition or shock thickness may be considerable. In view of this ambiguity, the question arises whether the type of motion predicted by Equation (7.9) can even exist or maintain itself in the real world. The matter can be resolved by consid- eringthefullequationofmotion(5.22)todetermineunderwhatconditionsdiffusionand wave steepening might be in balance, to allow the stability of the uniformly progressive flow assumed in the derivation of (7.9). By means of a moving coordinate system it can be shown that the monoclinal wave profile is actually stable, as assumed, provided , in which is the critical depth, and provided the wave front extends an 1 2 cr cr infinite distance downstream. It can also be shown that in most practical cases on large rivers the wave will rise to 0.90( ) within a distance of the order of , which is usually of the order of some tens of kilometers; this means that the monoclinal rising wave is often well approximated on long rivers.

Substitution of (7.15) into the storage equation (7.11) yields the governing differential equation K(1 X) (7.16) Interpretation of the parameters Some insight can be gained in the nature of the parameters and by considering the two main features of the flood wave in progress. These features are the time it takes for the flood wave to pass through the reach, and the change in shape the flood wave streamflow routing Fig.7.6 Waterstoredinthe channelreachcontrol volumeoflengthΔx.

The mean time of occurrence of a flood wave is the first moment about the origin, denoted as or this quantity is also referred to as the centroid or center of area of the hydrograph. Therefore, the travel time is the difference between the mean time of occurrence of the wave at the exit section and that at the inflow section of the reach, (cid:4) (cid:4) that is , as shown in Figure 7.7; as before, the subscripts e and i refer to the outflow and inflow sections of the reach. In other words, that travel time is the time between the centers of area of the inflow wave (t) and of the outflow wave (t), or (cid:7) (cid:7) t Q dt t Q dt (cid:7) (cid:7) Q dt Q dt a lumped kinematic approach The integrals in the denominators of (7.17), which are the zeroth moments, are required to normalize Q; ideally, they should equal each other, if there are no lateral inflows or outflows in the reach.

Accordingly, when (cid:6)x, the channel reach has a length the celerity of a Muskingum wave is = (cid:6)x/K The width or average duration of a flood wave hydrograph, which is one of the more obviousmeasuresofitsshape,canbeconvenientlycharacterizedbyitsstandarddeviation σ,thatis,thesquarerootofitssecondmomentaboutthemean, .Thus,thechangein shapeofafloodwavehydrograph,afterpassingthroughachannelreach,canbedescribed by the difference between the second moments of the outflow and inflow hydrographs, namely (m ). Since the second moment about the mean is related to the moments about the origin as indicated in Equation (13.12), this difference can be written as − = − − + e2 i2 e1 i1 in which the difference between the two moments about the origin is (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:4) (cid:4) (m ) (7.22) (cid:7) (cid:7) Q dt Q dt As before, in (7.22) the two terms in the denominators should be equal to each other, when there are no additional in- or outflows in the reach.

On the other hand, in a uniform rectangular channel with a plane water surface the two sections should be weighted equally and ideally 0.5. Equation (7.25) allows now a fuller interpretation of X. Equation (7.19) already showed that the parameter is the mean residence time of the flood wave in the reach; K2 [T2]. both second moments and in (7.25) have the basic dimensions Hence 1 2X reflects the rate of increase of the (streamwise) width of the wave as it travels through the reach; because mass is conserved, 1 2X must also reflect the rate of decrease of its height, that is, the rate of subsidence of the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph. According to (7.25), the difference between the two second moments is maximal when X=0,thatisunderconditionsofpurereservoiraction.Ontheotherhand,(7.25)indicates that, when the wave does not undergo deformation, but it retains its original shape as it travels. Because the peak of a flood wave normally decreases along its path, in principle should be smaller than 0.5."}

Section 12.2.1) can be applied. In what follows, the method of least squares is presented as an example. The simple form of Equation (7.37) immediately suggests that it should be possible toestimatetheconstantcoefficientsbymultiplelinearregression.Thereis,however,one small complication, in that the coefficients must satisfy the constraint 1. This constraint can be incorporated by defining the variables , and , and by recasting (7.37) as follows i2 e1 2 i1 e1 y c x c x which can be considered as a linear regression equation of on and , forced through the origin. By applying the method of least squares to Equation (7.43) it can readily be shown that optimal values of the coefficients can be calculated with the following yx yx x x (cid:11) (cid:11) and (7.44) yx yx x x (cid:11) (cid:11) and, of course, 1 . The summations can be performed over the time range for which the hydrographs are available; this will yield values of the coefficients, which perform well “on average” (in the least squares sense). However, if certain features of the hydrograph require greater accuracy, such as for example the flows in the vicinity of the peak discharge, it may be desirable to perform the summation over a more narrow time range. With these three coefficients , and determined, Equation (7.37) can be applied to solve any routing problem. In case the Muskingum parameters are needed for one or other reason, they can be calculated from these coefficients by inversion of (7.38), that is by using and (7.45) Example 7.3. Application of the multiple regression method The and hydrographs of Example 7.2, as listed in Table 7.2 and shown in Figure 7.10, can be used to illustrate the method. The reader can verify that the sums needed in (7.44) have the following values: 2 772 315, 1 942 872, (cid:11) (cid:11) =3838571,and =5454548(intheunitsofTable7.2squared). 8383823, With Equation (7.44) these yield the following values of the coefficients 0.018, streamflow routing 0.480 and 0.502; with Equation (7.45) the corresponding Muskingum param- eters are 1.97 h and 0.24. All these values are close to the corresponding ones obtained in Example 7.2 using the standard trial-and-error procedure; in fact, a plot of the resulting hydrograph would be difficult to distinguish from the curve shown in Figure 7.10 for 1.99 h and 0.3."}
{"text": "7.3.2 From physical characteristics of the channel Diffusive behavior of the Muskingum wave Amongthepropertiesofthelinearkinematicwaveisthefact,explainedinSection5.4.3, that it propagates along the channel with a celerity , but without any change in shape. Therefore,itwaspuzzlingtopractitionersforsometimeinthepastthatthisisapparently notthecasefortheMuskingumwave,eventhoughitisbasedonthesameapproximation as outlined in Section 5.4.4. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 7.10, a Muskingum flood wave undergoes not only translation in time but also a change in shape. It is now realized that the change in shape of the calculated wave is not the result of theunderlyingphysics,butrathertheresultofnumericaldiffusioncausedbytheapprox- imation of derivatives by ratios of finite differences. Any lumped kinematic approach is based on the storage equation (7.11); that equation is a discretized form of the continuity equation, in which the spatial derivative is approximated by a difference over a distance (cid:6)x. As pointed out by Cunge (1969), it is this approximation that causes the spreading of the calculated wave. The diffusion introduced by finite difference approximations can be determined by trying to recover the partial differential equation (5.111), without lateral inflow, from (7.37). Recall that the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the beginning and end of the time (cid:6)t; interval similarly, the subscripts i and e refer to the inflow and exit end of the spatial (cid:6)x. reach For the present purpose, the four terms can be expressed in terms of the rate of flow Q(x, t) by a Taylor expansion as follows (cid:5) (cid:6) ∂x ∂t ∂x2 where the terms of order higher than 2 have been neglected. Substitution of (7.46) − )(cid:6)t] into (7.37) and division by [(1 produces the following partial differential estimation of the muskingum parameters equation 0 (7.47) ∂t2 − ∂x ∂t This result is obtained from Equation (7.37). In principle, (7.37) is merely a finite differ- ence form of the kinematic wave equation (5.111) (in the absence of lateral inflow ). The kinematic wave equation contains only first-order derivatives. Hence, this suggests that the first two terms of (7.47) must represent the corresponding derivative terms in the kinematic wave equation (5.111); it also suggests that the additional three terms in (7.47),whichcontainsecond-orderderivatives,weresomehowintroducedspuriouslyby the finite difference approximation. This can be verified as follows. Upon substitution of (7.38) for the constants, the coefficient of the second term of (7.47) reduces to (cid:6)x since is the length of the reach, and the time of travel of this flood wave, their ratio istheMuskingumcelerityc ,alreadydefinedin(7.20).Thecorrespondingcoefficientin thekinematicwaveequation(5.111)isc .ThismeansthattheMuskingumwavecelerity is in fact the kinematic wave celerity, or The remaining three terms in (7.47) can be combined into one term by means of the followingkinematicwaveidentities(obtainedbytakingderivativesof(5.111)(forQ and making use of (7.48)), ∂x∂t ∂x2 Finally, with some algebra (7.47) becomes 0 (7.50) ∂t ∂x ∂x2 This is the standard advective diffusion equation with an advectivity, given by the kine- matic wave celerity, = (cid:6)x/K and with a diffusivity = − (cid:6)x/2 (1 2X) (7.52) inwhich,asbefore,thesubscript0indicateslinearity.Equation(7.52)illustrateshowthe (cid:6)x discretization is responsible for the diffusion effect inherent in the storage equation. (cid:6)xis In the limit, when made to approach zero to obtain a derivative, the diffusivity streamflow routing disappears; this is not the case for the celerity in (7.51), because the time of travel then also goes to zero. Physically based estimation of the parameters: the MCD method The MCD acronym stands for the Muskingum–Cunge–Dooge method and it refers to the names of the two investigators who contributed independently to its development. AsproposedbyCunge(1969),thenumericaldiffusionintheMuskingumformulation can be put to good use in the estimation of the parameters and K; this is done simply by requiring this numerical diffusion to be equal to the physical diffusion resulting from the hydraulic characteristics of the flow. Accordingly, equating (7.51) and (7.52) with (cid:6)x which for wide channels is equal to 1)V ], and (cid:6)x The symbol is a typical reference flow rate in the channel, the parameter of (5.39) which is normally taken as for turbulent flow (see Table 5.2), is the kinematic (cid:6)x wave celerity, is the channel width, is the bed slope, and is the length of the channel reach. With the more accurate expression (5.98) for the diffusivity, this is (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (7.55) (cid:6)x In cases when the channel is sufficiently wide, the Kleitz–Seddon principle (5.108) can be used to express (7.55) in even simpler terms, namely (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (7.56) + (cid:6)x 2 (a 1)S All these expressions for indicate that it is normally smaller than 0.5. In a different development, Dooge (1973) determined the parameters and of the Muskingumformulationbyequatingitsfirsttwomoments(7.31)and(7.34)withthefirst two moments obtainable from the unit response (5.72); recall that this response function is obtained by the exact solution of the linearized complete shallow water equation (5.67). The details of this derivation are beyond the present scope, but it is easy to show that the resulting expressions are the same as (7.53) and (7.56). This indicates that the application of the Muskingum formulation with (7.53) and (7.56) will ensure that it produces a wave motion whose average speed of propagation and dispersion are the same as those obtainable with the exact solution. It also means that the expressions for the Muskingum parameters in Equations (7.53)–(7.56) are even better than would be suggested by a cursory review of Cunge’s (1969) derivation. These expressions conform not only with the diffusion approximation, but with the exact solution of the linearized complete shallow water equation (5.67), as well. estimation of the muskingum parameters Practical implementation: linear or nonlinear? In the standard application of the Muskingum method the parameters and are usually considered as constants, and treated as characteristics of the channel reach in question. However, the physically based expressions (7.53) and (7.54) show how in reality and (cid:6)x depend on the reference rate of flow , once has been decided upon. As long as the actual flow rates are only small deviations from the reference flow , a linearized algorithmcanbeexpectedtoperformwell.Floodwavesnormallyinvolvelargedeviations, andsincetheMuskingummethodisessentiallylinear,thequestionariseswhatvalueshould be assigned to in Equations (7.53) and (7.54) to ensure optimal results. A few studies have focused on this issue. Actually, the form of (7.53) and (7.54) opens up the possibility of applying the Musk- ingum method in a nonlinear way. Cunge (1969) already suggested that be adjusted to allowextrapolationoftheMuskingumparametersbeyondtherangeofpreviouslyobserved events. Miller and Cunge (1975, p. 226) subsequently treated the parameters as functions responding to the flow rate at that time and adjusting them at every time step of the computation;theyappliedthistechniquetoachannelwithacompoundcrosssection.Inthe same vein, Koussis (1978) proposed an adjustment of at each computational time step, by means of the uniform rating curve to estimate (dQ ) in (7.53); but while can also be easily adjusted as a function of Q, he found from his analysis of wave propagation on the Rhine, that the results tend to be relatively insensitive to the exact value of and thatthereforeaconstantvalueshouldbeadequate.Ontheotherhand,PonceandYevjevich (1978) concluded that the overall difference between a linear and nonlinear application of resultsusinganaveragevalueofQtorepresentQ ,butopinedthattheuseofthepeakvalue of the hydrograph as might be easier to implement in practice. Example 7.4. Application of the MCD method Consider again the inflow and outflow hydrographs of Example 7.2 and illustrated in Figure 7.11. Assume that these flow rates took place in a river channel with an effective width of 170 m, an effective slope 0.0004 and an effective roughness 0.035.Thelengthofthereach,thatisthedistancebetweentheinflowandoutflowsection (cid:6)x = was taken as 23 km. In Example 7.2 the Muskingum parameters were found to be 1.99 h and 0.30. It is easy to check that Equations (7.53) and (7.54) produce the same values of these parameters with an assumed reference value of the discharge rate of roughly 2000 by means of the Gauckler–Manning equation (5.41) this can be shown to correspond with a water depth 6.14 m and a reference velocity m The hydrograph calculated with these values of and has already been compared in Figure 7.10 with the observed outflow hydrograph. The sensitivity of theMCDmethodtothevalueoftheassumedreferencedischargerateQ canbetestedby carrying out the calculations with two different values, say and 2500 In the case of 1500 in the same river channel (5.41) produces a velocity 1.71 m and a water depth 5.17 m. With these values one obtains with (7.53) and (7.54) the parameter values 2.24 h and 0.34. In the case of streamflow routing Fig.7.11 Observedhydrographs attheinflowendQi attheoutflowendQe listedinTable 7.2,andusedin Example7.2(heavy lines).Thecalculated outflowhydrographs (thinlines)areobtained withtheMCDmethod withreferenceflowrate 2500m3s−1 (triangles)andQ0 1500m3s−1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 (circles).

{"text": "7.3.3 Adjustment of calibration parameters on physical grounds The expressions for the Muskingum parameters derived in the previous section require a knowledge of the effective channel hydraulic parameters of the channel reach. In this case, “effective” means that the hydraulic parameters should have values, which produce the optimal results with the Muskingum procedure. Therefore, effective parameters may not be easy to ascertain from the available information on the channel characteristics or even from field surveys. Rather, for a given flood event, they are probably best obtained by calibration,bymeansoftheproceduresexplainedinSection7.3.1.However,theparameters in the Muskingum formulation are not constants, so that for some other flood that must be routed through a reach for design or forecast purposes, they are not likely to be the same as those obtained by calibration with past events. Nevertheless, the physically based expressions(7.53)–(7.56)obtainedintheprevioussectioncanstillbeusedtoadjustorscale the parameters obtained by calibration, to render them applicable to any other flood event with different flow rates.

However, the terms soil and aquifer material are often used interchange- ably. Many of these formations consist of alluvial and colluvial deposits, which as ripar- ian aquifers are major contributors to streamflow. Although in some regions underlain by limestone or karst formations, large quantities of water can be transported through solution channels and caves, globally they are of much less importance. Formations consisting of volcanic rock, shale and clay layers, which are porous but which transmit water relatively slowly, are often considered impermeable for hydrologic purposes; as such they are referred to as aquicludes. The voids or open spaces between the particles of soils and other granular materials are referred to as pores. An important property of such water-bearing formations is their porosity. This can be defined as follows (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)∀ volume of voids in lim (8.1) (cid:2)∀ (cid:2)∀→0 where(cid:2)∀isasmallvolumeofporousmaterial.Thisdefinitionissubjecttothecontinuum paradox: on the one hand, the limit is necessary to allow the description of phenomena (cid:2)∀ at a point by means of infinitesimal calculus; on the other hand, the volume must be kept large enough so that represents a meaningful ensemble average over pores of many different sizes. The porosity of a soil depends primarily on its particle size distribution and on its structure. Some of these features are illustrated in Figures 8.1 and 8.2. A soil with a wide distribution of particle sizes tends to have a smaller porosity than a soil consisting of particles or grains of a more uniform size. The structure of a granular porous material refers to the arrangement of the particles among one another and to their aggregation into larger structures. Thus the porosity can be increased by agricultural operations, such as ploughing or raking, or by frost; these processes “open up” the soil simplybyrearrangingtherelativepositionsoftheparticles.Similarly,theporosityofthe soil can be decreased by compaction. In principle, in the case of soils consisting of inert material, their texture, that is the size of the particles, should not affect the porosity, as long as their structure, particle size distributions and chemical composition are similar. However, actual soils are not inert, but the surfaces of their particles carry electrical water beneath the ground Fig.8.1 Illustrationoftheeffectoftextureandof particlesizedistributionontheporosity.In ofuniformsizearrangedinacubicpacking (i.e.asimilarstructure)resultinaggregates withexactlythesameporosity,regardless ofthesizesoftheparticles.Theparticlesin box(b),whichareofdifferentsizes,result inanaggregatewithsmallerporosity.

Moreover, their chemical composition can vary widely. Some of the soil constituents, such as colloidal clay, organic matter, lime, and colloidal oxides of iron and aluminum, can act as cementing agents, which further the aggregation of particles into larger structures. As a result, clayey soils tend to have higher porosities than sandy soils. hydrostatics of pore-filling water The volumetric water content of a soil can be defined in a similar way as Equation (8.1), namely (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)∀ volume of water in lim (8.2) (cid:2)∀ (cid:2)∀→0 Clearly, when a soil is fully saturated, its water content, denoted , is by definition equal to the porosity, ."}

This process can be illustrated by the following thought experiment. A thought experiment Consider, as shown in Figure 8.3, a sample of soil SS to be tested; it is placed on a porous plate PP in a container C, to which a flexible tube FT is connected. (In a real experiment a B¨ uchner filter with fritted disk with sufficiently small pores can be used for this purpose.) The pores of the porous plate PP are much smaller than those of the sample SS (see Figure 8.4). Set up the experiment in such a way that initially the entire system, i.e. soil sample, container and tube, are filled with water, and that the vertical distance between the center of the sample and the outlet of the tube is zero. Assume for this simple experiment that the soil sample is incompressible so that it maintains its original volume throughout, and that the water has a constant density . Now increase stepwise by small increments and wait after each step until equilibrium is established, that is, until water stops flowing out at the lower end of the tube. Record after each step volume∀ (cid:2)∀ the value of and the total of water drained during all previous steps. If is the volume of the sample SS, this total volume of drained water can be converted to the volumetric water content of the soil sample simply by (n Note that, relative to atmospheric pressure, the pressure of the water in the soil pores is given = −γ γ = ρ by d, where is the specific weight of the water. In practice, when the density of the water is constant, it is often convenient to express the pressure as equivalent height of water column ; in these units the pore water pressure in this experiment can simply be written as .

In the remainder of this chapter the soil water suction, whenever expressed as a positive height of water column, will also be denoted by ). Typically, the relationship between the soil water pressure and the water content is of the form shown in Figure 8.5. This relationship is also variously referred to as the characteristic, the and the soil water soil water suction relationship soil water reten- relationship. Some other examples of soil water characteristic curves are shown in Figure 8.6.

The pressure of the water in the soil profile above a water table can be measured by means of a tensiometer; this instrument appears to have been introduced by Richards (1928).

{"text": "8.2.2 Mechanisms of water retention Wateroranyotherfluidcanbeheldinnaturalsoilsbyseveraltypesofmechanism,involv- ing different forces at the molecular level. Some of the more important mechanisms can be ranked, according to increasing energy required to remove the water, as follows. (i) As water is removed from a non-shrinking saturated soil, it is replaced by air, and water–air interfaces develop in the pore space; the energy required to form these interfaces, and thus to withdraw the water, is directly related to surface tension. hydrostatics of pore-filling water (ii) Natural soils, especially those with finer texture, consist of particles that are not inert, but active as a result of electrical charges at their surfaces. In the presence of water such surface-active particles interact, repelling each other and attracting in the intervening spaces ions, and thus also more water to relieve the osmotic pressure; this osmotic pressure difference, between the water in the immediate vicinity of the particles and that in the larger pores of the soil, in turn gives rise to hydrostatic pressure differ- ences. This may also be accompanied by swelling during wetting, and shrinking during subsequent drying. (iii) Water molecules also behave as dipoles, and as such they may undergo attraction by the electrical surface charges of the soil particles. (iv) When the soil contains clay particles (especially montmorillonite), water can be held between the “sandwich” layers of these clayey minerals in a quasi-crystalline fashion; actually, the water is held so strongly by this mechanism that it could be debated whether the water should be considered “free” or “chemically bound.” Surface tension Among these mechanisms, those involving surface tension are probably the most impor- tantinthecontextofhydrology.Surfacetensionorcapillarityactsattheinterfacebetween two fluids. In simple terms, one can visualize the molecules in a liquid as being subject to attraction by their neighbors. Far from boundaries the field is symmetrical and these molecular effects are balanced. However, near the interface with another fluid whose molecules are less attracting, the balance is broken and the molecules are pulled more toward their own bulk. In order to increase the interfacial area of the liquid in question, work is necessary. The surface tension is a measure of this work and, thus, of the energy required to maintain that interface. In the case of the interface between water and air, in the range of 0 30 the surface tension can be estimated approximately by 10−3 Jm−2 Nm−1), (75.6 0.14 T) (or with the temperature in C (degrees celsius). The word capillarity is derived from the Latin capilla, or hair, because surface tension is manifested by the phenomenon of the rise of water in hair-thin glass tubes. In the soil profile the zone above the water table, where the water content is near saturation even though the pressure is negative, is often referred to as the (see capillary fringe Figure 8.7). Similarly, whenever the soil water pressure is negative, it is also called pressure. capillary Equation of Laplace As a result of surface tension, any pressure difference across the interface of two immis- cible fluids that are in contact with each other is accompanied by a curvature of their interface. It can readily be shown that this phenomenon is described by (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)p = σ ± (cid:2)p(= − in which ) is the pressure difference across the interface, and and are the two principal radii of curvature of the interface; the plus sign between the two termsinsidethebracketsappliestosynclasticinterfaces,andtheminussigntoanticlastic surfaces.

Equation 8.3 is commonly attributed to Laplace and can be derived as follows. Derivation of the Laplace equation Because the surface tension represents the energy required to maintain the interface, it is convenient to make use of the principle of virtual work.

Special case of a capillary tube In the case of the capillary tube, in which water is in contact with air at atmospheric increase(cid:2)p = − pressure, as illustrated in Figure 8.10, the pressure (p ) in the tran- sition from water to air equals the suction (i.e. negative pressure) in the water ). If the radius of the tube is small enough so that the interface can be assumed to have the R/cosα, α curvature of a sphere, the radii of curvature are both equal to where is the wetting angle of water with the glass. The wetting angle between water and quartz-like materials and other soil minerals is usually (except in the presence of impurities) small; the water pressure according to Equation (8.3) becomes then simply and the capillary rise is H) or roughly at when both and are in cm and the specific weight is constant. Equation (8.5) is valid for the ideal case of a tube of circular cross section with a radius R. Figure 8.4 illustrates how the water can be held in an analogous way in the pores of an irregular array of particles; for such pores of irregular cross section, Equation (8.5) can be used to define an effective radius: this is the radius of a capillary tube of circular cross section, with (cid:2)p = −p the same value of across its water–air interface. Pore size distribution In numerous studies the effective radius of curvature of the air–water interface in a pore, as used in Equation (8.5), has also been taken as a measure of the size of that pore; by analogy with pipes with a circular cross section, is usually taken to be equal to twice the hydraulic radius , as defined in Equation (5.40), that is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the pore to its wetted perimeter. Equation (8.5) indicates that the pressure drop across the air–water interface in any pore is inversely proportional to the size of the pore. This means that with increasing negative pressures or suctions H)increasinglysmallerporesarebeingemptied.Thesoilwatercharacteristic withthewatercontentθ,thatisthewaterstillleftinthesoil.Hence, relatesthesuction if it is assumed that at a given suction all pores above size are empty, the soil water characteristic with (8.5) is equivalent with a cumulative pore size distribution.

To avoid the limitations of the capillary model in the range of lower water contents, where other water retention forces are predominant, in this context it is convenient to use a linear transformation, defining an effective saturation, where is the water content at atmospheric pressure, i.e. at 0; the subscript r refers to the residual water content or residual degree of saturation, which is mainly a normalizing parameter but which may also be visualized as the moisture present in dead end pores or otherwise so strongly held that it is unavailable for flow. The effective = (R)/dR pore size density can be obtained by determining the slope of (R) as a functionof R.Figure8.11illustrateshowsucheffectiveporesizedistributionanddensity functions can be obtained from the soil water characteristic by means of Equations (8.5) and (8.6). This approach to obtain a pore-size distribution probably dates back to the work of Donat (1937), who used his results to characterize the structure and stability of soils. Similar early studies were also undertaken by Schofield (1938), Bradfield and Jamison (1946). As discussed further in Section 8.3.4, this type of pore size distribution has also hydrostatics of pore-filling water Fig.8.12 Illustrationofhysteresisincapillarytubeswith expansions.Thewaterlevelsfalltopositions1ifthe tubesareinitiallyalreadyfilledwithwaterwhen insertedintothewaterbath;thewaterlevelsriseto positions2ifthetubesareinitiallyemptywhen insertedintothewater.

As shown in Figure 8.4, the water–air interfaces, or menisci, tend to occur at the narrower openings or “necks” of the pores. It is thus incorrect to assume that at a given suction all pores with effective sizes larger than that given by Equation (8.5) are filled with air. Nevertheless, in the past the concept has been useful for comparative purposes and in order-of-magnitude estimates."}

Figure 8.12 shows that the water–air interface can be found at different levels in capillary tubes with expansions, depending on the manner, in which these tubes have been filled.

The bounding curves of the hysteresis regions shown in these figures are called curves; any point wetting and drying boundary inside the hysteresis region can be reached by scanning curves; the scanning curves starting from the drying and wetting boundary curves can be called primary wetting and curves, respectively. It is obvious by now that there is an infinity of drying scanning possible scanning curves in the hysteresis region. To describe these quantitatively, some type of interpolation scheme must be devised. hydrostatics of pore-filling water Fig.8.15 Typicaldryingand wettingboundary curvesofthesoil watercharacteristic.

However, one of the first attempts to treat capillary hysteresis in soils quantitatively was published by Poulovassilis (1962), who made use of the concept of The effect of entrapped air One obvious manifestation of hysteresis is often observed in experiments involving suc- cessiveandrepeateddryingandwettingcycles.Asanillustration,considerthefollowing sequence illustrated in Figure 8.15. Assume that initially the soil is fully saturated and θ = θ θ = that its water content is ; thus all its pores are filled with water so that which is the true porosity as defined in Equation (8.1). Consider that, next, the soil is drained down to by imposing a negative water pressure, and that it is then subsequently rewetted by bringing the pressure back to zero. At this point the water content will invariably not be , but somewhat smaller, say . This difference can be attributed largely to the presence of entrapped air in dead-end pores, from which it cannot escape during the rewetting cycle. Usually, all subsequent drying and wetting cycles will continue to take place between and , and normally it will be impossible to recover the original water content at . In carefully controlled experimental set-ups in the laboratory the full saturation can only be achieved by taking special precautions, such as the use of deaerated water or the passage of CO through the soil prior to the application of the water, or prolonged soaking or immersion. The water content is oftenreferredtoassatiation,todistinguishitfromthefullsaturation,θ .Thetwoterms are often used interchangeably. However, in field situations involving normal wetting and drying processes, the water content at 0 is usually satiation. water beneath the ground Fig.8.16 Exampleofthe independent function The independent domain approach In brief, this concept involves the assumption that each element (or pore) of the total pore space is specified completely by the (negative) pressure range over which it is emptied, and that over which it is filled. Implicit in this is that any such element is either full or empty, with a transition sometimes referred to as a Haines jump. With this assumption, one can define a function F(H ), which represents the fraction of the pore space, which drains at a negative pressure or suction and wets or is filled at a suction . This function can be represented graphically by the isometric projection shown in Figure 8.16. All pores require either the same or a larger suction to be emptied than that required to fill them, so that . The symbol denotes the maximal tension to be experienced in the soil water. The function can now be related to the soil water characteristic as follows.

The primary wetting scanning curve BA shows how the water content which drained between 0 and is redistributed during rewetting; similarly, the primary wetting scanning curve CA shows how the water content that drained between 0 and is redistributed during rewetting. Hence, subtraction of the amount of water entering the pore space as described by curve BA from the amount entering, as described by curve CA, shows how the amount redistributes itself during rewetting. Graphically, this difference is the vertical (in Figure 8.18) distance betweencurvesCAandCB(cid:7)A(cid:7),whichisalsoshownasthecurveDE.Itfollowsthattherate δ(δθ/δH )/δH of change of this rate of drainage, namely is the increase in refilled water content per unit wetting suction decrease.

For this reason several attempts have been made to simplify the independent domain model withvarioussimilarityassumptionsby,amongothers,Parlange(1976),MualemandMiller (1979), and Braddock al. (2001). In what follows a brief description is presented of Parlange’s (1976) proposal, which has been useful in many practical applications. Themainassumptionisthat isindependentof ,sothat F(H , )canbereplaced by F(H ). This means that, for example in Table 8.1, the values in each column can be replaced by their averages. In Table 8.1, the values in the column between values 20 and 24 cm, all become equal to 4.05%. It also means that, for example in Figure 8.18, DE would be represented by a straight line. The main advantage of this simplification is that it becomes possible to calculate all the scanning curves from the boundary drying curve, which is also the easiest to determine experimentally. For instance, the function F(H ) can be determined immediately by integration of Equation (8.9) as water beneath the ground 0 10 20 30 H ) (cm) Fig.8.19 Soilwatercharacteristiccurvesinasequenceofwettinganddryingpathsfollowingthesame sequenceasintheexampleshowninFigure8.17.Thesolidcurveswereobtainedusingthe experimental functionofTable8.1,andthedashedcurveswereobtainedbyapplyingthe similarityassumptiontothesamedata.

Numerical calculation The numerical procedure can be illustrated by using the same sequence as shown in Figure 8.17. Assume for the present example 20cm, 8cm, 16cm, and 4 cm. The calculations can be readily carried out by summing and subtracting the values in Table 8.1, as indicated in Figure 8.17. The results for the regular independent domain procedure using the values of Table 8.1 and those for Parlange’s (1976) simplified procedure using averaged columns in Table 8.1 can be compared in Figure 8.19. While the determination of hysteresis curves is difficult enough with data obtained in the laboratory, it is even more so with field data (see Royer and Vachaud, 1975; Watson etal.,1975).Therefore,althoughtheindependentdomainapproachanditssimplerversions may perhaps be considered crude approximations, they should be quite useful in practical simulations of soil water flow problems. Certainly, the error resulting from this approxi- mation will be much smaller than the unavoidably large errors resulting from uncertainties hydrostatics of pore-filling water Fig.8.20 Soilwatercharacteristiccurveforafinesand (OsoFlaco)duringdrainage,showingthe = (θ r)/(n0 effectivesaturation, r), againstnegativepressureinthe water w,expressedincmof equivalentwatercolumn.Thecurverepresents = 0.405, θ = 0.0381, Equation(8.15)with 0.0280cm−1,andb = = 6.7;thecircles representtheexperimentalcurve,already showninFigure8.5. in the values of soil water flow parameters and from ignoring hysteresis altogether, as is currently still almost universal practice."}

{"text": "8.3.1 Dynamics of pore-filling fluids: the law of Darcy The original experiments In a report on the public fountains and water supply for the City of Dijon in Burgundy, Darcy (1856) presented the results of his experiments on the seepage of water through a pipe filled with sand, with a 0.35 m inside diameter and a 3.00 m effective length (see Figure8.21).Inbrief,hefoundthattherateofflow throughthesandlayerwasdirectly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the sand column and to the difference of (cid:2)L hydraulic head across the layer, and inversely proportional to the length of the sand column. In this notation his result can be formulated as (h (8.17) in which the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the entrance and the exit section of the column, respectively. The symbol represents a constant of proportionality, which is now com- monly referred to as the conductivity, and which has the dimensions [L hydraulic In the experiments of Darcy the water had essentially a constant specific weight and the hydraulic head can be defined as usual, namely where is the vertical coordinate. When the negative pressure is expressed as equivalent water column, Equation (8.18) can also be written concisely as H. Anyinstrumentusedtomeasurethehydraulicconductivityk,thatissimilartotheset- up originally used by Darcy, is often referred to as a permeameter. Over the years many different designs have been developed, but they are all nearly the same in principle, in that they provide the measurements of and (h ) needed to invert Equation (8.17) in order to estimate k. Some types of permeameters are also available commercially. Formulation at a point Undertheassumptionthattheporousmaterialcanbetreatedasacontinuum,both and (cid:2)L can be allowed to become infinitesimally small, so that Equation (8.17) describes the flow at a point and can be written concisely in common vector notation as where is the specific volumetric flux, that is the volumetric rate of q q i q j q k flow per unit area of porous material, the gradient water transport in a porous material Fig.8.21 Drawingof theoriginal experimental set-upas presentedby Darcy(1856). operator. With subscripts representing the vector components, this is also often written where represents x, and for 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For a fluid of density at a pressure in an infinitesimal control volume, the forces that drive the flow are (per ∇p (ρgk), unit volume) the pressure gradient and gravity if is the vertical coordinate so that is the unit vector in the vertical direction. Therefore, whenever the fluid density water beneath the ground varies over the flow region, the hydraulic head cannot be given by Equation (8.18), but it must be defined in gradient form as follows, ∇h = + ∇p In the same notation as Equation (8.20) this gradient can be written as ∂h ∂x ∂p ∂x ∂x ρg ∂x in which is specified as the vertical coordinate. The (intrinsic) permeability It stands to reason that the ease or difficulty with which a fluid flows through a porous medium depends on the sizes and the arrangement of the pores and also on the prop- erties of the fluid. Therefore the hydraulic conductivity must be affected by both fac- tors. Whenever it is desirable to separate the effects of the fluid from those of the porous matrix, use can be made of the permeability, also called intrinsic permeability, with dimensions This is defined as (cid:7)γ (cid:7) whereγ = ρg isthespecificweight,ρ thedensity,μthedynamicviscosityandν = μ/ρ thekinematicviscosityofthefluidinquestion,respectively.Onewaytoarriveattheform ofEquation(8.23)isbysimpledimensionalanalysis;thusoneobservesthattheeasewith which the fluid moves through the porous material, that is the hydraulic conductivity [L T is in fact the ratio it is then reasonable to assume that this ratio should be affected by the following three variables: the area available for the flow in the pores,ascharacterizedbysomeeffectiveoraverageporeradius ,[L],andthetwofluid propertiesthatgovernthedynamicsoflowReynoldsnumber(orcreeping)flows,namely theviscosityμ,[M onlywaytocombinethesethreevariablestoobtainthesamedimensionsasthehydraulic conductivity is as (Ge in which Ge is a dimensionless constant introduced to represent the geometrical shape of the pores; hence, on dimensional grounds Darcy’s equation assumes the form The main point of (8.24) is that it shows first, how the fluid property effects on the flow can be separated from those of the porous matrix; and second, how the porous matrix itself affects the flow, not only by the sizes of the pores in terms of , but also by their geometrical shape in terms of Ge. The sizes of the pores depend mainly on the sizes and the distribution of the sizes of the solid particles of the porous material. The geometricalshapesofthepores,inturn,dependlargelyonthearrangementofthesesame particles. This explains how the hydraulic conductivity of soils can be greatly reduced by compaction, as carried out for road or dam construction purposes, or also greatly water transport in a porous material increased by ploughing, harrowing and other agricultural operations. But the concept has its limitations, and should be used with caution, especially in the case of clayey soils. Depending on the type of clay, the pore structure of some soils may be sensitive to the type of electrolytes or salts that are in solution in the water; for instance, sodium is notorious in this regard. This means that it is not always possible to separate the effects of the fluid on the hydraulic conductivity completely from those of the porous matrix. It is of interest to observe that in the form of Equation (8.24), Darcy’s law can be consideredasageneralizationofseveralwell-knowncreepingflowequations,obtainable for certain flow regions with a regular geometry, to the case of a totally irregular pore geometry resulting from the random assemblage of the particles of soils and other gran- ular materials. For instance, in the case of flow through a straight pipe of circular cross section, creeping flow is described by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation; this is equivalent with (8.24) if is taken to represent the average velocity in the pipe, is the radius of parallel plates (as used in the Hele–Shaw model) by putting Ge and as half the spacing of the plates, again if is made to represent the average velocity. Similarly, Equation (8.24) can be used to describe the average velocity of flow down a plane as in (5.32), provided Ge is taken as the depth of flow and the hydraulic gradient is the slope of the plane . All three expressions just mentioned are exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations (1.12) for creeping flow, and can be found in elementary textbooksinfluidmechanics.(RecallthatcreepingflowisflowwithaverylowReynolds (Dv/Dt)becomes number so that negligible.) In the literature there have been numerous attempts to derive Darcy’s law from the Navier–Stokes equations, mostly by analogy with these exact solutions. On account of the irregular geometry of the pores resulting fromrandompackingsofparticles,toarriveatthedesiredresultanysuchderivationmust involve some kind of ensemble averaging and other stochastic assumptions, which may not always be valid. But regardless of such considerations, pragmatically it is probably preferable to adopt Darcy’s law simply as it is, that is as an experimentally obtained and verified relationship, in which or is best obtained from measurements. True velocity As defined in Darcy’s equation, or is the volumetric rate of flow per unit bulk area of porous material. Thus even though it has the basic dimensions of [L it does not represent the average velocity of the fluid particles. The “true” average velocity inside the pores is usually assumed to be given by (q ) under fully saturated conditions, and by (q under partly saturated conditions. Anistropy (cid:7)) same direction and (or is a scalar quantity, that is independent of direction. Porous materials in which this holds true are referred to as isotropic. A material is said to be when its properties, such as the hydraulic conductivity or the permeability, anisotropic water beneath the ground dependondirection.Mostsoilsandotherwater-bearingformationstendtobeanisotropic to some degree.

In an anisotropic material the two vectors and do not necessarily point in the same direction. It can be shown that the only way to formulate a linear relationship between such vectors is by means of a second-order tensor or a dyad. Thus Darcy’s law for anisotropic material must be of the form ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k x xx xy xz ∂x ∂y ∂z ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k y yx yy yz ∂x ∂y ∂z ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k z zx zy zz ∂x ∂y ∂z Alternatively, this can be written more concisely in the subscript notation as (cid:12) has nine components. Symmetry of such a tensor In general, the second-order tensor quantity, i.e. , is known to be a sufficient condition to allow it to be diagonalized, suchthatithasonlythreecomponents,alongthreeprincipalaxes.Thehydraulicconductivity tensor is usually assumed to be symmetrical. Example 8.4. Directions of the gradient and of the flux vector To bring out some of the implications of anisotropy, consider the flux vector and the negative hydraulic gradient vector which drives it, in a principal axes system, as shown in Figure 8.22. The gradient consists of two components, and can therefore be broken down as follows ∇h = i+ = Similarly, the specific flux can be written as |q|(cosβi+sinβk) also be written as water transport in a porous material Fig.8.22 Definitionsketchofthedirectionsofthespecificfluxand gradientvectorsinananisotropicmaterial,inwhich kxx kzz,and x z and areprincipalaxes. respectively, one obtains tanβ = tanα This shows that the directions of the specific flux and of the (negative) hydraulic gradient canbethesameonlywhentheporousmediumisisotropic.Inananisotropicmaterialthese two vectors point in different directions. Scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity It has been noted in numerous applications of Darcy’s law to field conditions, that the values of k, required to reproduce the observed flow rates, tend to depend on the size of the domain over which Equation (8.19) is integrated or averaged. In other words, the magnitude of is scale dependent. Thus values of the hydraulic conductivity for a given soil are often larger when obtained from auger hole measurements in the field, than from small column measurements in the manner of Darcy (see Figure 8.21) or in other types of permeameters. Values of obtained by inversion methods with data from small river catchments (see Brutsaert and Lopez, 1998) tend to be still larger. Permeameters involve a flow domain with typical length scales of the order of 1.0 m at most, while auger hole measurements and pumping tests tend to have zones of influence with length scales of theorderof10–102 m,respectively;smallcatchmentsusuallyinvolvescalesoftheorder of m or more. There are several possible reasons for this scale dependence. One is that most per- meameter measurements are carried out on disturbed samples; thus the soil is scooped up and placed in the permeameter in a way that usually does not replicate the origi- nal soil structure in the field. Moreover, under natural conditions in the field, most soils havemacroporesandotheradditionalconduitsresultingfromdecayingplantroots,from worms and from burrowing animals; even if undisturbed samples are used, it is nearly impossible to include such macropores and other larger channels within the relatively small confines of a permeameter. Finally, even within a supposedly homogeneous soil type,allsoilpropertiesdisplaypronouncedspatialvariability.Atfieldscalesoftheorder of m, the hydraulic conductivity is usually close to lognormally distributed (see the larger values in the domain have a relatively larger effect on the overall flow than the smaller values. But regardless of the distribution, in a two- and three-dimensional flow situation, regions of smaller conductivity can be bypassed by the flow, resulting water beneath the ground Experimentalvaluesofrelativepermeabilityk(cid:2)/k(cid:2) Fig.8.23 (orrelativeconductivity)ofwater(wettingfluid– asandysoilandinasiltyclayloam.ThecurvesforwaterrepresentEquations (8.36)with(8.45)and thoseforairrepresenttheanalogousexpressionforanon-wettingfluid.(AfterBrooksandCorey, in a larger effective conductivity for the entire flow domain, than a simple average value would suggest (see El-Kadi and Brutsaert, 1985). In flow simulation calcula- tions, the variability of the soil characteristics is usually avoided by the assumption that the entire flow domain is homogeneous and that effective parameters can be used (see Section 1.4.3), to represent the flow domain. The scale dependency of the hydraulic conductivity is a direct result of this assumption."}
{"text": "8.3.2 Partly saturated flow Extension of Darcy’s law It was probably Buckingham (1907) who first postulated that Darcy’s law (8.19) is also valid for a soil that is only partly saturated with water, and that in this case the hydraulic conductivity is a function of water content, or As the water content of the soil is reduced, decreases. Reasons for this are that fewer pores are available for flow, and that the flow paths become more tortuous and thus longer, as the water can no longer move through emptied pores and must move around them. Because the larger pores are emptied first, the initial decrease in conductivity for a certain decrease in water content is larger than that later on at lower water contents. Actually,thewateroftheemptyporeshasbeenreplacedbyair.Undersuchconditions Darcy’s law is also valid to describe the flow of air; but it must be applied with an “air head” gradient as given by Equation (8.21) with the density of air.

In what follows and will usually denote the hydraulic con- ductivity and permeability, respectively, at saturation or satiation. Under partly saturated conditions the hydraulic conductivity is also often called the conductivity.

However, measurements of soil water content and water pressure, at several levels in the profile and over extended periods of time, are not easy and require many precautions.Thus,fieldmethodsareusuallyhard,ifnotimpossible,toapplywhenoneof the following conditions is present: a water table close to the surface, frequent and large precipitation, non-negligible or unknown net lateral inflows, a large vertical drainage rate at the lower end of the profile, and large variability in the soil properties. Because field methods are only feasible under exceptionally favorable conditions, many attempts have also been made to develop conceptual prediction methods. Some of these methods will be touched upon in Section 8.3.4.

Nevertheless, as will be seen in the next chapter, the diffusion formulation continues to be of interest because it has greatly simplified the analytical treatment of a number of important soil water problems. Some examples of the dependence of soil water diffusivity on water content are shown in Figure 8.27."}
{"text": "8.3.3 Limitations of Darcy’s law Upper limit In light of the analogy between Darcy’s law and other creeping flow equations of fluid mechanics, it should not be surprising that experiments have shown that, as the Reynolds number increases beyond a certain limit, the specific flux gradually deviates from its linear proportionality with the hydraulic gradient Indeed, by definition, creeping flow is flow for which the appropriate Reynolds number is sufficiently small, so that the accel- eration terms, both temporal and advective, in the Navier–Stokes equations are negligible. Any Reynolds number definition requires the adoption of a characteristic velocity and permeabilityk(cid:7) of a characteristic length of the flow geometry. The definition of the in Equation (8.23) indicates that it has the basic dimensions of and that it can be con- sidered proportional to a characteristic or typical cross-sectional area of flow; thus, since the specific flux has the basic dimensions [L it is convenient to define the Reynolds number for flow in a porous medium as follows k(cid:7) Re (8.33) water beneath the ground Fig.8.28 Convergingsectionofaductillustratinginertiaeffectin aporewithvariablecrosssectionandwiththeresulting convectiveacceleration∂V/∂x; and arethemean inflowandoutflowvelocity,respectively.Athigher velocitiesthiseffectbecomesmorepronounced;theflow ceasestobecreepingandDarcy’sequationisnolonger The Reynolds number is a measure of the relative magnitude of the inertial forces over the viscousforces;thismeansthatDarcy’slawcannotbeexpectedtobevalidforvaluesofRe that are much in excess of order one. It should be emphasized that this initial deviation from Darcy’s law is not caused by the onset of turbulence, but solely by the effects of fluid accelerations. These accelerations result from the irregular and tortuous flow paths in the pores, as illustrated in Figure 8.28. Forchheimer(1930,p.54)wasamongthefirsttoanalyzeexperimentaldataandin1901 he proposed the following to describe them where and are constants for any given soil. Some insight can be gained in the nature of these constants by dimensional inspection of the Navier–Stokes equation (1.12). The term on the left and the first term on the right in Equation (8.34) correspond to the three terms on the right of Equation (1.12); thus represents the effect of viscosity and in terms of the ν/(gk(cid:7)). α = βq2, permeability it is The second term on the right, corresponds to the terms on the left-hand side of (1.12) and therefore, it represents the inertia effects on the flow. Forsteadyconditionstheleft-handsideof(1.12)isv·∇v.Dimensionally,thetwovelocity are[L−1];because termsareproportionaltoq2.Ontheotherhand,thedimensionsof∇ k(cid:7) is the characteristic length scale of the pores, this suggests that is inversely proportional to it, or k(cid:7) where is a constant, which can be expected to depend on the geometry and shape of the pore spaces. Equation (8.35) has been confirmed in numerous experimental investigations. For instance, Arbhabhirama and Dinoy (1973) have reported values of ranging between approximately 0.6 (sand) and 0.2 (angular gravel). Lower limit Several experiments with clayey soils have shown that Darcy’s law also fails to describe the measurements when the flow rates become very small (see Miller and Low, 1963; Swartzendruber, 1968). These experiments indicate that under conditions of low flow rates aresmallerthan−k∇h (orsmallh-gradients),themeasuredspecificfluxesq wouldrequire. The issue has been somewhat controversial (Olsen, 1966) and is still far from resolved (Neuzil,1986).Nevertheless,thisphenomenonmaypossiblyresultfromthefactthatinthe neighborhoodofclayparticles,whichinvariablyhaveelectricalcharges,thewatermolecules may become oriented in a quasi-regular fashion, on account of their dipole characteristics; water transport in a porous material as a result the viscosity of the water may no longer be Newtonian, a necessary condition for the validity of the Navier–Stokes equations and Darcy’s law. Also, in many situations additionaldrivingmechanismsmaybeatplay,besidethehydraulicgradient∇h;thesemay cause flow even when 0. Additional driving forces For most purposes in hydrology it can be assumed that the driving forces are primarily mechanical in nature, which means that the flow is driven by gravity and by a pressure gradient in accordance with Darcy’s law. However, in general, water transport in a porous medium can be influenced by several other factors, involving thermal, osmotic and some- times even electrical effects. For instance, changes in temperature at some point in a partly saturated soil may result in changes in surface tension which affect the pressure given water content, and thus the liquid transport. An input of heat can be accompanied by local vaporization, which in turn sets up a specific humidity gradient, and thus a water vapor transport in the air filled pore space; this vapor may then condense further down and affect the liquid water flux. Onaccountofthecomplexityofthevariousphenomenaandtheirinteractionwithinthe soil, at present there is apparently no theory available, which is generally accepted. Nev- ertheless, in recent years many problems, involving simultaneous heat and water transport, have been studied within a framework developed by Philip and DeVries (1957; DeVries, and practical compatibility of the formulation of Philip and DeVries with concepts of irre- versible thermodynamics; more recently, Cahill and Parlange (1998) have clarified the role of the vapor transport. By numerical simulations Milly (1984) has investigated the relative importance of the temperature gradient on the water transport; he concluded that, for many practicalpurposes,itissufficientlyaccuratetoassumethatthewatertransportisessentially isothermal and driven only by the hydraulic gradient"}
{"text": "8.3.4 Expressions for the conductivity and the soil water diffusivity functions Conductivity of saturated materials In the past, numerous equations have been proposed to predict the hydraulic conductivity of porous materials, mostly on the basis of measurements of the particle sizes or their dis- tribution or also of the pore size distribution, as obtained from Equation (8.5). However, such equations were usually obtained from permeameter measurements of and are there- fore valid only at the local scale. As noted earlier, tends to be scale dependent, so that these methods cannot be used when the hydraulic conductivity is to be used at the field or catchment scale, as is often the case in hydrology. For applications over larger areas it is therefore advisable to obtain by means of inverse methods with measurements at the appropriate scale. One such inverse method, based on drought flow recession analysis, will be considered in Chapter 10. Conductivity of partly saturated materials As seen earlier, under partly saturated conditions the determination of is not an easy task. However, while in many flow calculations the accuracy of at high water contents is fairly critical, at lower water contents some inaccuracies can be tolerated.

Inspection of past determinations of shows that it may be as low as 1 and as high as 20, but that typical values lie around 3–5; appears to be small for materials with a narrow pore size distribution and larger for wider pore size distribu- tions. Interestingly, this power form equation has been derived on the basis of some widely different theoretical models. It is tempting, therefore, to conclude that the power form is independentofitsmethodofderivation.SomeofthesemodelsarereviewedinSection8.3.5. = + 2.5/b), best description of the available experimental data. Equation (8.36) is one of the oldest and still among the most widely used expressions today. Recently it has also received renewed theoretical interest because it arises naturally inthefractalcharacterizationofsoils.Otherparameterizationshavebeenproposedfork(θ), but they are all fairly similar to (8.36). θ H(= −p /γ Since the water content is a function of the negative water pressure ), it is also possible to express as a function of H. Gardner (1958) has proposed an empirical function, which can be fitted to data for many different soils, viz. where a, and are constants; note that is equal to , the hydraulic conductivity at satiation and is the value of for The range of was found to lie between about 2 for clayey soils and 4 or more for sandy soils. It can be seen that Equation (8.37) is of the right general shape to fit to experimental data such as shown in Figure 8.29. As already mentioned and illustrated in Figure 8.25, however, k(H) normally exhibits marked hysteresis, so that the constants have to be adjusted to reflect this. In some applications it is convenient to describe the hydraulic conductivity by an expo- nential function as follows k k H H H where and are constants for a given soil; Equation (8.38) was introduced by Gardner (1958) without ; this constant was added later by P.

{"text": "8.3.5 Some models for permeability The experimental determination of the hydraulic conductivity is never easy for saturated soils, but it is especially difficult for unsaturated soils as a function of soil water content. Forthisreason,manyattemptshavebeenmadetodevelopsimpleconceptualizationsofthe flow process and to represent by simple parametric equations, in terms of other properties of the soil that are easier to determine. Uniform pore size models In one common approach the porous medium is assumed to be analogous to a bundle of uniform and parallel capillary tubes with circular cross section. Around 1950, Averyanov (Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952) analyzed the flow of an annulus of wetting fluid in a single tube, the central part of which was occupied by stagnant air. The solution of this flow problem yielded an equation that could be approximated closely by (8.36) with a power =3.5.Bymakingtheslightlydifferentassumptionthatthenon-wettingfluidatthecenter of the tube moves under the same pressure gradient as the wetting fluid along the wall, Yuster (1951) obtained Equation (8.36) with 2. In a different approach, use is made water transport in a porous material of the hydraulic radius concept; it was proposed originally by Kozeny (1927) for saturated materials and can be defined as the ratio of pore volume to particle area. Irmay (1954) extended this to unsaturated porous media and derived (8.36) withn 3. Parallel models In this approach the pore system is assumed to be equivalent with a bundle of uniform capillary tubes of many different sizes. The distribution of the pore sizes is derived from explained after Equation (8.6). The true mean velocity in each pore can be described by a Hagen–Poiseuilletypeequationforcreepingflow,namely(8.24)withavalueofGearound Because (R) represents the pore size density, )(dS )s istheportionoftheporevolumeoccupiedby 0 r e 0 r e “active”pores,withradiusbetween(R denotesavery small increment of R.

Purcell (1949) and Gates and Tempelaar-Lietz (1950) were among the first to apply this approach, and came up with expressions similar to Equation (8.43). However, because (8.43) tended to yield values considerably larger than available experimental data, several subsequentauthorsincludedatortuosityfactorintheformulationtoaccountforthelimita- tions inherent in this model of straight parallel tubes. The tortuosity concept had originally been introduced by Carman (1937; 1956) as an improvement on the uniform hydraulic = /L)2,inwhichL radiusmodelofKozeny(1927),anditcanbeexpressedas (L isthe actual or microscopic path length of the fluid particles in the pores, and is their apparent or macroscopic path length along the Darcy streamlines. In several studies this tortuosity was assumed to depend on the water content, i.e.S ; in this case the relative permeability k(cid:7)/k(cid:7) κ = (= k/k ) can be written as (cid:7) (cid:7) ⎣β ⎦ ⎣β ⎦ β = β(S β = 1.0. where the variable ) is related to the tortuosity and is its value at Burdine (1953) proposed on the basis of his experimental data that water beneath the ground Example 8.5. Calculation with the power function A well-known application of the parallel model is the result of Brooks and Corey (1966), who adopted Burdine’s assumption in (8.44) and integrated it with (8.14) for the soil water characteristic, to derive Equation (8.36) with the value of the exponent Observe that without Burdine’s assumption for tortuosity the parallel model would have yieldedn with experimental measurements for two soils in Figure 8.23. For the Poudre sand the = = 3.4; wetting fluid curve was calculated with the parameters 0125 and for the = 0.250 = 2.3. Amarillo silty clay loam the values used were and Series-parallel models The theoretical construction of these types of model also starts with a bundle of parallel pores,eachwithadifferentbutuniformsize.However,theseporesarethencutnormallyto thedirectionofflowwithtworesultingfaces,andfinallyaftersomerandomrearrangement of the tubes the faces are joined again. This way account is taken of the random variations of the pore sizes, not only in the plane normal to the direction of flow, but also along the direction of flow. In the original version of this model the discharge rate in each single pore, which consists of two sections in series, is assumed to be governed by the section with the smaller diameter. Again, the distribution of the pore sizes is derived from the true velocity in each pore is obtained by means of a Hagen–Poiseuille like equation, as shown in (8.24). This approach was pioneered by Childs and Collis-George (1950) in a finite-difference scheme to calculate the permeability from experimental data. The model was subsequently reformulated in integral form by Brutsaert (1968a), to allow the derivation of more concise analytical expressions for k; this formulation is presented Oneoftheimplicitbutbasicassumptionsoftheoriginalapproachisthatthesizesofthe poresinflowsequencearecompletelyindependentofeachother.Asnoted,thisisvisualized in the construction of the model, by considering that the porous medium is equivalent with anarrayofparalleltubesorflowchannelsofdifferentsizes,whichisfirstcutintotwoparts byaplanesectionnormaltothedirectionofflow;thissectionproducestwosurfaces,which are subsequently joined together again after some random rearrangement of the tubes. It was shown earlier that )s is the area, per unit bulk cross-sectional area of porous material, which is occupied by openings whose sizes are between (R and (R this is also equal to the probability of a point in any cross section through the mediumbeingfoundinaporewiththatsize.Therefore,thefractionoftheareaofthissection occupiedbythesequenceofflowporeswithsizebetween (y first surface with pores with size between (z and (z of the second surface is equal to [θ (1− (z)δyδz If it is assumed that the flow between two pores in sequence is controlled by the smaller of the two, say with size y, then the rate of flow that takes place through a fraction of the −δy/2)and cross-sectionalarea,occupied bythe sequencesof pores withsize between (y water transport in a porous material (y that are in contact with the pores with size between (z and (z − [θ (1− y2δyδz (y)s (z) in which the subscript n indicates the direction normal to the section. The pores with a size between (y and (y of the first surface are in contact with pores of all possible sizes of the second surface. The discharge rate through these pores is (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:7) (cid:7) 0 r e e e e where is the size of the largest pores that are still available for flow at the given degree of saturation. The first term gives the flow rate from the pores of the first surface with size between(y than y; the second term gives the flow rate into the pores of the second surface that are larger than y. Integration over yields finally the total discharge per unit cross-sectional area of porous medium. Hence the intrinsic permeability, defined in Equation (8.23), can be written as k(cid:7) = [θ (1− + )]2 z2dzdy (y)y2 S s s s s dzdy 0 r e e e e where and are dummy variables representing R. This result can be applied to fully saturated media simply by putting It can also be expressed directly in terms of the soil water characteristic function, by means of (8.5), Laplace’s equation for capillary Se x Se Se k(cid:7) where now and are the dummy variables representing . One can show by integration by parts that the first double integral on the right is identical with the second; thus (8.47) can be expressed in a more condensed form as k(cid:7) (2 (S (8.48) Equations (8.47) and (8.48) can now be applied immediately with suitable expressions = ∞and = media to obtain by putting 1.0, respectively, they have been applied k(cid:7)/k(cid:7) mostly to obtain the relative permeability . Example 8.6. Calculation with the power function As before, the integration is especially simple with Equation (8.14) and it produces k(cid:7) S2+2/b +1)(b +2) water beneath the ground For the relative permeability this results again in (8.36) with the value of the exponent The original version of the series-parallel model, both in its finite difference forms and Jackson al., 1965). Although there is a wide variation for different soils, it appears to produce reasonable results for unstructured soils (without macropores). However, it also tends to overestimate the relative permeability somewhat under drier conditions. Several shortcomings of the model are obvious from the assumptions invoked in its derivation. These are that: (i) the sizes of pores in sequence are independent of each other; (ii)theflowrateinaporesequenceiscontrolledbythesmallestdiameter;and(iii)thepores in sequence are lined up perfectly, and they are straight without tortuosity. Assumptions be seen by considering that in the parallel models the sizes of the pores in sequence are assumedtobetotallydependentoneachother,sinceeachflowchannelisassumedtohavea uniform cross section over its whole length; parallel models, without tortuosity correction, severelyoverestimatethepermeabilty.Thustheassumptionofanypartialcorrelationwould result in a further overestimate. Similarly, as regards (ii), inclusion of the larger pore size in the sequence into the expression for the fluid velocity would also result in a larger rate of flow. This means that the overestimate is not the result of assumptions (i) and (ii) but mainly of assumption (iii). To compensate for these shortcomings, in several studies use was made of the concept of tortuosity. Although the concept is intuitively clear, there has been no unanimity in defining it conceptually or mathematically. Clearly, the drier the soil is, the less perfect the remaining pores with water line up, and the more tortuous the flow paths become. For this reason, a common way of implementing the tortuosity effect has consisted of assuming that it is directly proportional with some power of the size of the largest pores, that contain water, and thus of the water content of the soil (see Millington and Quirk, 1964; Mualem, , where is an empirical constant. As noted, this assumption was already used earlier in several of the parallel models (Burdine, 1953; Brooks and Corey, 1966). Subsequently, however, it was observed (Brutsaert, 2000) that this assumption is incapable of producing agreement with experimental data. Rather, it was found necessary to assume that the tortuosity of a flow path through any given pore depends on the characteristic spatialscaleofthatspecificpore,andnotjustonthescaleofthelargestpores.Actually,this assumptionhad alreadybeen used by Fatt andDykstra (1951), in theirparallel model, with the physical justification that liquid flowing through smaller pores travels a more tortuous path; accordingly, they assumed that the tortuosity is inversely proportional to a power of the pore size, say in which is another constant to be determined experimentally. It is straightforward to incorporate this assumption into the series-parallel model pre- sented above, to adjust it for tortuosity and possibly other factors that may not be fully shouldbetakenas(2+c) takenintoaccount.Thus,inEquation(8.46)thepowerof and instead of 2, so that instead of (8.48) one obtains k(cid:7) (2 (S (8.51) field equations of mass and momentum conservation regression 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 DependenceofninEquation(8.36)ontheexponentb Fig.8.31 inthepowerformofthesoil-water retentionrelationship(8.14).ThepointsaretheexperimentalvaluesfromMualem’s(1978) datacollection.Theregressionlineisn=2.18+2.51/b.Alsoshownarethelinesobtainedwith Equations(8.44)and(8.49).(Theparameterb tendstobesmallerforfiner-texturedsoils.)

{"text": "8.4.2 General case of two immiscible fluids in an elastic porous material Biot (1941, 1955, 1956a, b) was probably the first to present a general theory of elasticity of a porous material saturated with an elastic fluid for the three-dimensional case with an arbitrary and variable load. This theory was subsequently (Brutsaert, 1964; Brutsaert and Luthin, 1964) extended to describe the elasticity of an unconsolidated granular material, containing two fluids in its interstices. Later Verruijt (1969) showed that Biot’s theory for a saturated material can be simplified to describe groundwater movement in most cases of practical interest; he thus demonstrated that Biot’s theory can often be reduced to Jacob’s (1940) simple equation but also that in some cases the general theory is the only one that succeeds in explaining experimental results. In what follows, Verruijt’s (1969) develop- ment is combined with Brutsaert’s (1964) two-fluid extension of the theory to obtain a general formulation for unconfined and confined groundwater flow. Although the matter is straightforward, a careful exposition is desirable to bring out the significance of the under- lying assumptions of the various more special groundwater equations used in the technical literature.

The strain components of the solid are defined as xx x xy x etc. Their physical significance is illustrated in Figure 8.32.

It would seem that besides the effect of partial occupancy of the pores by is also water beneath the ground affected by the effective stress path, the pore geometries, the wetting angle, and probably other factors.

Thus the total air pressure is .

However, if the process in question involves only wetting, or only drying, so that hysteresis effects are avoided, ) can be taken as a function only of the saturation and of the porosity. The components of the stress tensor and the changes of the displacements of the three phases must satisfy the equations of motion (Brutsaert, 1964) or for slow displacements the simpler equilibrium equations (Verruijt, 1969). However, these are not needed in the present derivation. Stress–strain relationship If the solid strains and the changes in fluid content are small and if the processes involved arereversible,thestresscomponentsmayingeneralbeassumedtobelinearfunctionsofthe strain components (Biot, 1941, 1955). This assumption yields a generalization of Hooke’s law (Brutsaert, 1964) in the case of an isotropic porous material: = 2μe +λe +c +c sw w sa a τ = 2μe +λe +c +c yy yy sw w sa a τ = 2μe +λe +c +c sw w sa a τ = 2μe τ = 2μe τ = 2μe xy xy xz xz yz yz τ = +c +c w sw w w wa a τ = +c +c a sa wa w a a in which are constants characterizing the elastic behavior of sw sa w a wa thematerial.TheseequationsreducetoBiot’s(1955)whentheporesaresaturatedwithone fluid and to Hooke’s law for isotropic bodies if only the solid were present. Thus and represent the behavior of the solid. A fluid displacement does not result in a shear stress, only the rate of displacement does; therefore the fluid strains do not appear in the shear stresscomponents.Thecoefficientc canbeunderstoodbyconsideringthesituationwhere field equations of mass and momentum conservation wetting fluid is forced into the porous material, while the total volume of the other two is somehow kept constant, i.e. when and are kept zero. This means that owing to (8.67), where is the bulk modulus of the wetting fluid and its compressibility. Similarly, for the non-wetting fluid S) (8.69) where is the bulk modulus of the non-wetting fluid. The coefficients and a sw sa wa indicate that, in principle at least, there should be a coupling between the volume changes of the three constituents as indicated by the subscripts. However, as is now shown, these coefficientsareequaltozeroifthedensityofthesolidgrainscanbeassumedtobeconstant. To see this, eliminate the fluid strains from Equation (8.67) to obtain an alternative form of the generalized Hooke law, namely, xx xx 1 2 w 3 a )e (8.70) 1 2 w 3 a 1 2 w 3 a together with the fourth, fifth, and sixth of (8.67). The new constants are (cid:13) (cid:14) 2c (c (c c c c c c c c c c 1 sw sa wa a w 2 sw a sa wa 3 sa w sw wa (cid:13) (cid:14) Consider now a thought experiment in which , the effective stress, is held constant but the fluid pressures are increased. In the case of a porous material containing only one fluid, this can be accomplished by placing an unjacketed saturated sample in the fluid and then increasing the fluid pressure. In the case of material containing air and water, this can be accomplished by increasing and in such a way that their difference remains constant.Itisclearthatifthesolidgraindensityisconstant,thisprocessdoesnotincreasethe effective stresses, nor does it result in any solid displacement. Thus Equation (8.70) shows =c =0, =0 one has also which immediately results in as well. Moreover, if this is the case, one can relate and to the bulk modulus of the solid frame, as follows: Stress versus rate of strain relationships for fluids AsnotedinSection8.3.1,Darcy’slawrepresentstheequationofcreepingmotioninporous material. When the motion takes place within the pores while the porous material itself is being subjected to deformation, the Darcy flux must be taken as the relative motion between the solid matrix and the fluids. Apparently (Verruijt, 1969), this concept was first proposed for liquid saturated media by Gersevanov around 1934. Biot did not use it in his original paper (Biot, 1941), but he introduced it in his generalized theory of elastic- ity (Biot, 1955). The displacement vector of the solid is an actual displacement length, whereas the displacement vectors of the two fluids are defined herein as volumes when multiplied by the total bulk cross-sectional area normal to them. Thus the relative velocity water beneath the ground of the wetting fluid with respect to the solid is S)] and an anal- ogous expression for the nonwetting fluid, so that the respective Darcy fluxes are given When there are two fluids within the same pores, it is clear that the relative motion between the fluids may give rise to an additional “head” loss. This means that Darcy’s law, which expresses a linear relationship between flux and the gradient of pressure and body force, can be written in a general form as follows: ∂w ∂u ∂w ∂v 1 1 1 1 1 kw n0S kwa n0S μ an0(1−S) ∂v ∂u ∂v ∂w 1 1 1 1 1 ka kwa n0S where is the (intrinsic) permeability and is the Newtonian viscosity. (Note that in what follows in this section for convenience of notation the prime symbol is omitted from the permeability terms .) Recall that the total pressure is the sum of the initial p(cid:7) and the incremental pressures, or . Since the initial pressure is hydrostatic, so that it follows that (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) where is the vertical coordinate and the specific weight; the quantity is defined in Equation (8.21). The subscript w refers to the wetting fluid; the same quantities, butwiththesubscripta,refertothenonwettingphase.Thecross-permeabilitytermk arises from the relative motion between the two fluids. For most practical problems, the effect of this relative motion is probably negligible. It is conceivable, however, that it becomes important under conditions of counterflow; this would be the case, for example, of water infiltration into a soil profile in which the displaced air is being prevented from escaping downward so that it bubbles upward while the wetting front moves down. The possibility of momentum exchange as a result of this relative motion has been considered already by Yuster (1951) and Scott and Rose (1953). Mainly because it is practically impossible to determineexperimentallyatpresentandprobablysmall,itisomittedinwhatfollows.Then Equations (8.72) become ∇p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) −n (1− = − The equations presented so far form a complete system. They can be combined to eliminate certain less useful variables and to leave only those pertinent to most practical problems. One way of accomplishing this is to consider the solid displacements and the fluid pressures. Together with the porosity and the degree of saturation, these are seven p(cid:7) p(cid:7) u, , , , variables: and S. If it is assumed that the porous matrix is homogeneous andinert,sothatμ λareconstantandindependentof and andthusofspaceandtime(this (8.70) into the well-known equilibrium equations (for incompressible grains) yields field equations of mass and momentum conservation The fluid displacement terms in Darcy’s law can be eliminated by multiplying each of (8.74) first by and , respectively, and then taking the divergence, after which substi- tution of the continuity equations (8.61) and (8.62) gives ∇p(cid:7) n S] n S ∇p(cid:7) Hence it should be possible to solve it for any consolidation or flow problem involving an elastic porous material occupied by two elastic fluids. Fortunately, for many problems this possible to simplify it considerably as follows. Simple case of constant vertical load In soil mechanics and groundwater hydraulics the problem formulation is commonly sim- plified by two basic assumptions that were introduced by Terzaghi (1925, 1943) and Jacob (1940, 1950). First, compression is assumed to be strictly vertical without any horizontal solid displacements, and second, any changes in vertical compressive effective stress are balanced by equal and opposite changes in fluid stresses. These assumptions may be diffi- culttojustify,buttheresultingformulationhasbeenusedquitesuccessfullyinthesolution of many problems in porous media saturated with one fluid. This suggests that the concept mayalsobevalidinthesimplificationofcertainproblemsinvolvingtwoimmisciblefluids. =u =0, =e In the present notation the first assumption can be written as so that τ = (2μ+λ)e τ = −(τ +τ The second assumption can be written as ), which yields with (8.64) and Noteasanaside,thatEquation(8.78)agreeswiththegeneralobservationthatsoilsthatare closetosaturationdonoteasilydisintegrate,butexhibitacertaindegreeofconsistencyand coherence. Indeed, if the effect of the air pressure can be neglected, in a soil that is close p(cid:7) to saturation, the water pressure is negative and the effective stress factor is close to unity; hence the intergranular stress is also negative, which means that the soil grains are drawn together and the soil exhibits a greater firmness. This effect can also be seen, for example, on a sandy beach just after the sea water has withdrawn during ebb tide; at that p(cid:7) timethesandformsahardersurfacethanwhenitissubmerged,with 0,orthanwhen it is totally dry. χp(cid:7) p(cid:7) Substitution of (8.63) into the first of (8.76) yields (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) ρ +n Sρ β +n ρ =∇ · w 0 w w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t μ water beneath the ground ∂p(cid:7) in which is assumed to be a constant, as a measure of the S)isassumedtobenegligibleon account of the small solid velocity.

The combination of (8.79) with (8.80) and (8.81) yields the following diffusion-type equations: ∂p(cid:7) (χp(cid:7) p(cid:7) w w 0 w w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t ∂t (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) ∂p(cid:7) p(cid:7) (χp(cid:7) a a 0 a a 0 a ∂t ∂t ∂t ∂t (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) in which, on account of (8.77), can be defined as the vertical compressibility of the solid (2μ+λ)−1 Notethatthisisdifferentfromthevolumetriccompressibility )], xx yy zz that is, the inverse of Equation (8.71). The physical significance of the terms in Equations (8.82) can be explained as follows. The entire left-hand side of both equations represents the local rate of change of storage of the fluid in question at a point. In the case of the first of (8.82), which describes the flow of the water (i.e. the wetting fluid), the first term on the left is the rate of change of storage resulting from compression (or expansion) of the solid matrix caused by pressure changes in the water; the second term represents the storage rate of change caused by compression (or expansion) of the water; the third term is the rate of change of storage resulting from bulk volume changes of the solid matrix caused by pressure changes in the air. The fourth termshowstherateofchangeofwaterstorageresultingfromlocalchangesofthedegreeof saturation. Finally, the right-hand side, which is a divergence of the Darcy flux, represents the storage rate of change as the difference between the inflow and outflow rate of water at the point in question. The different terms of the second of (8.82), which describes the flow of air, represent, mutandis, the same mechanisms as those in the first. Before proceeding, for a better understanding of Equations (8.82) and their limitations, the basic assumptions may be briefly repeated. 1. The grains are incompressible. χ = χ(S). 2. The effective stress is obtainable by means of Bishop’s parameter 3. The solid displacements are sufficiently small, so that the solid frame is elastic withintherangeofu;whenthisisnotthecase,thiscansometimesberemedied.For example, as shown in Brutsaert and Corapcioglu (1976) the basic derivation leading to Equation (8.84) can be readily extended to flow in a viscoelastic aquifer. 4. The solid displacements are vertical only, with a constant total load. Verruijt (1969) has described situations of saturated flow when this assumption is not valid. field equations of mass and momentum conservation 5. The fluid compressibility is defined in Equation (8.80) in terms of partial time derivatives. 6. The terms S) and S)] are negligible. Equations (8.82) are the main result of this section. In principle it should be possible to solve them for appropriate boundary conditions, provided the values of the parameters are known. However, for many common situations they are more general than necessary, and they can be simplified considerably. Some special cases (i) Flowofonepartiallysaturating,elasticfluidinanelasticporousmaterial.Whenever theairpressurecanbeassumedtobeconstant,thesecondequationof(8.82)becomes irrelevant; the first equation of (8.82) can then be written as (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) w w w 0 w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t μ This equation was examined in Brutsaert and El-Kadi (1984) to study the relative effects of partial saturation and compressibility on the flow in unconfined systems. It may be noted that in the groundwater literature, various derivations have been presented; these have yielded results somewhat different from (8.84), mainly in the firsttermontheleft.Somereasonsforthediscrepanciesbetweentheseotherequations and (8.84) stem from the neglect of the relative velocity in Darcy’s law (8.72) and of the equation of continuity of the solid (8.63). The latter assumption is especially serious,since(8.63)involvesthecompressionofthesolid,whichinturngivesriseto the compressibility Other differences result from the use of the total pressure , p(cid:7) rather than , as is done here, and also from the neglect of . (ii) Flow of one elastic fluid in an elastic porous material. This case is the one to which the theory of Biot (1941; 1955) is applicable. Because the pores are filled with one fluidonly,onehas and (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) k(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) ρ (α +n β = ∇ · ) (8.85) k(cid:7) inwhichthesymbolk hasbeenreplacedbythemorecommon forthepermeabil- gk(cid:7)/μ ity.Ifnowalsothehydraulicconductivityk )isassumedtobeconstant, (8.85) assumes the well-known linear form: ∂p(cid:7) k∇2p(cid:7) where g[n This form is the same as that of the equa- Equation (8.86), but with various expressions for , has been applied widely in the description of soil consolidation and of flow in confined aquifers. It was proposed for one-dimensional consolidation by Terzaghi (1925), who later (1943) extended it to three dimensions. Independently, Theis (1935) adopted the heat flow equation to analyzehorizontalunsteadyflowinanelasticartesianaquifer,buthejustifieditonly on the basis of heuristic arguments concerning the analogy between Fourier’s law and Darcy’s law. But it was Jacob (1940; 1950) who derived this heat flow equation water beneath the ground for confined aquifer flow in terms of the physical properties of the aquifer and the fluid. Subsequently, however, the exact derivation of Equation (8.86) remained the subject of controversy, until Verruijt (1969) showed how it can be reconciled with Biot’s (1941; 1955) analysis. InadditiontothelimitationsinherentinEquation(8.84),theTerzaghi–Jacobequa- tion (8.86) is also restricted by the assumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity. k(cid:7) As shown earlier in this chapter, the permeability is dependent on the porosity ; k(cid:7) isproportionalton2 they are in fact unknown dependent variables. In other words, it is assumed that the fluid and the porous matrix are compressible on the left side of (8.85) but not on the ∇p(cid:7) right. This assumption may have its limitations whenever is not small. Still, in spite of this inconsistency, for most problems the exact formulation of (8.86) in terms of physical properties of the porous material and the fluid is probably not very crucial, since (S is usually determined from field experiments. Consequently, as k(cid:7) irrotational or unidirectional displacement and the constancy of and may be ,β ,μ,λ, difficulttojustify,themainproblemisnothowtoexpress intermsof etc., at the micro- or Darcy scale, but rather whether the heat flow equation (8.86) is adequate to solve the practical problem at hand at the larger scale of the aquifer. (iii) Flow of two immiscible fluids in an incompressible porous material. In this special case,thesolidphasecannotmove,sothatthedisplacementuandtherateofdisplace- be written as: (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) (ρ = ∇ · S) (8.87) (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) These equations are equivalent to those first proposed by Muskat and Meres (1936) but taking account of the solubility of the non-wetting fluid in the wetting fluid. Equations (8.88) have been used to study the effect of soil air movement on the infiltration of water (Le Van Phuc and Morel-Seytoux, 1972; Morel-Seytoux, 1973). Whenever the effect of the non-wetting fluid is negligible, owing to small viscosity ∇p(cid:7) and small pressure changes , only the wetting fluid is of interest; if the density of this fluid is constant, (8.87) reduces to ·(k∇p(cid:7) which is equivalent to Equation (8.55), first derived by Richards (1931) for soil water movement.

At the local scale, as precipitated water reaches the ground surface, into the soil takes place. In infiltration between precipitation events, the atmosphere exerts its drying effect, and the water in the soil profile may move to the surface by and by liquid rise, vapor diffusion capillary where it evaporates. As illustrated in Figure 8.23, a small decrease in water content below saturation can cause a significant decrease in conductivity, so that in most soils the difference in hydraulic conductivity above and below the water table can be large. At an inter- face between soils with different conductivities, the streamlines are known to exhibit a pronounced refraction; therefore, in many situations unsaturated flow above the water table can be assumed to be nearly vertical, whereas the saturated flow below the water table can be assumed to be more horizontal or parallel to underlying impervious layers. Accordingly, in this chapter, infiltration and related flow phenomena in the partly satu- rated zone of the soil are analyzed in a one-dimensional vertical framework. Similarly, in Chapter 10, it is shown how many saturated flow situations can be analyzed in the one-dimensional framework of hydraulic groundwater theory. Because the infiltration capacity constitutes an upper limit of maximal rate of entry into the soil, it is treated first in Sections 9.2 and 9.3; rain infiltration is treated in Section 9.4. Various parameteriza- tions of the infiltration of precipitation and related processes at the catchment scale are covered in Section 9.5. Finally, Section 9.6 describes a few elementary mechanisms of capillary flow during inter-storm periods."}
{"text": "9.1 GENERAL FEATURES OF THE INFILTRATION PHENOMENON Infiltration can be defined as the entry of water into the soil surface and its subsequent vertical motion through the soil profile. In most situations of practical interest, the soil profile is initially less than saturated. Therefore, if it can be assumed that the displaced air can escape freely, the flow of the infiltrating water in the soil is governed by the Richards equation (8.55). For vertical downward movement of water this can be written (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂θ ∂ ∂H ∂k ∂t ∂z ∂z ∂z infiltration and related unsaturated flows In Equation (9.1) is the water suction or negative pressure expressed as equivalent water column, and (contrary to its normal usage) denotes the depth, that is the vertical coordinate pointing down. Infiltrationcantakeplaceinoneoftwopossibleways.Whenthesurfacewatersupply rate resulting from precipitation or other sources is intense enough, part of it remains ponded or runs off, and part of it infiltrates at the maximal rate; this maximal rate of infiltration is the capacity. When the intensity is low, all of the precipitated infiltration water seeps into the pores; this is infiltration. rainfall"}
{"text": "9.1.1 Infiltration capacity For the purpose of analysis, consider the simple case of a deep uniform soil profile. The soil surface is assumed to be covered by a layer of water, which is sufficiently thin, so that at the soil surface the water pressure is atmospheric and the soil saturated; also, the initialwatercontentisassumedtobeconstantthroughouttheprofile.Thecorresponding boundary conditions are then as follows θ = θ = > = θ = θ = = ≥ The first of these two conditions represents the initial situation at 0 characterized by a constant water content and water pressure , throughout the soil profile. The second represents the condition at the soil surface 0, maintained indefinitely after theonsetoftheinfiltration.Asanillustrationofthekindofsolutionthatcanbeexpected, Figure 9.1 shows the water distribution during infiltration into a soil column, observed in a laboratory experiment. Without going into the details of the solution of (9.1) subject to (9.2), at this point it is useful to make some general observations regarding the short and long time nature of the flow. Short-time behavior In Equation (9.1), the first term on the right represents the flow caused by the pressure gradient owing to capillarity and the second term represents the flow caused by the Earth’s gravity field. As the water starts to enter the relatively dry soil, the pressure differences in the water at the surface and in the soil are quite large and, as a result, the second term on the right is practically negligible compared to the first one. Therefore in its early phase, infiltration can be described by the following (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂t ∂z ∂z is referred to as a problem.

{"text": "9.1.2 Rainfall infiltration Like the infiltration capacity, the infiltration of precipitation on the soil surface is gov- erned by the Richards equation (9.1), but the boundary conditions are quite different from (9.2). Because in this case the water supply rate at the surface is smaller than the maximal rate the soil is capable of taking in, the surface water content is smaller than byanunknownamount;theonlyknownfeatureoftheflowatthesurfaceisthesupply rate or precipitation intensity, and thus the flow rate into the soil. As long as the water supply rate is maintained, this unknown surface water content gradually increases. If the precipitation rate is large enough, eventually the surface water content reaches the maximum possible value ; after this occurs, water starts to pond the surface. If denotesthetimefromthestartoftherainfalluntiltheinceptionofponding,theboundary conditions can be formulated as follows θ = θ = > = k P k k P z t t θ = θ = = ≥ where P(t) is the intensity of the precipitation. The first condition represents again an initially constant water content throughout the soil profile. The second condition indicates that the flux is known at the surface; the third shows that, after ponding starts, the surface is satiated but the flux is no longer known. If the precipitation rate is small, however, the surface soil layer never becomes fully satiated; thus and the third condition of Equation (9.5) is redundant.

{"text": "9.2 INFILTRATION CAPACITY IN THE ABSENCE OF GRAVITY: SORPTION Sorption, that is horizontal infiltration of water into a partly but uniformly saturated soil, when the movement of the displaced air is unimpeded, is a problem of long standing in the hydrologic literature. Although by itself this type of one-dimensional horizontal flow may not be very common in nature, the solution of this problem is of practical importance. First, it gives a good description of the initial stages of vertical infiltration of water ponded on the soil surface, that is the short-time behavior, while the effects of infiltration capacity in the absence of gravity capillarity totally dominate those of gravity. Second, it has been useful as an essential part, or building block, of solutions for the later stages, obtained by various techniques."}

Infiltration φ = φ(θ). The solution of Equations (9.13) and (9.14) can be formulated as Before actually knowing that solution, it is already possible to infer some essential features of the infiltration phenomenon. Indeed, without specifying the actual form of the solution, as illustrated in Figure 9.4 for the vertical case, the cumulative volume of infiltration can obtained by integration of the total water volume that has entered the soil; this can be an integral either of (z or of dz). Hence, the cumulative volume of infiltration, with dimensions can be written in general as infiltration and related unsaturated flows Fig.9.4 Sketchillustratingthe calculationofthe infiltratedvolume as theareaunderthe θ = θ(z)curve,thatis thewatercontent profileinthesoilata giveninstantintimet.

Thus one can construct the following dimensionless variables and (9.21) Over the years, the sorptivity has come to be considered as one of the more funda- mental flow properties of a soil whose relevance extends well beyond the phenomenon of sorption. As will become clear later in this chapter, the sorptivity also arises naturally in the formulation of vertical infiltration capacity and in the formulation of different facets of rainfall infiltration. Methods have been developed to measure the sorptivity in and Broeren, 1994).

In field situations there may be such important complications as the effect of air movement, areal variability and stratification of soil properties, an impermeable layer at shallow depth, the effect of crusting at the soil surface, fingering, non-uniform initial water content after redistribution during a period of drainage and evaporation, and others. Some are briefly touched upon in what follows. Flow of air Undercertainconditionsthemovementofaircangreatlyreducethemovementofinfiltrating water. For example, it is not unusual that, when there is a shallow impermeable layer or a shallow water table below a relatively flat surface ponded with water, bubbling of air can be observed; this is evidence of a counterflow of air, which undoubtedly (see Linden and Dixon, 1975) reduces the water intake rate. Several mathematical formulations have been developed to describe infiltration as a flow problem of two immiscible fluids. Examples of these can be found in the studies by McWhorter (1971) and Sonu and Morel-Seytoux (1976). When the objective is a rigorous physical description of the flow at the Darcy scale, infiltration should be considered as a two-phase flow phenomenon.

In experiments dealing with natural soils, a difference of 2% is very difficult to detect. Soil variability The spatial variability of soil properties has been studied with measurements in the field have been made with remotely sensed data (Cosh and Brutsaert, 1999).

Later, essentially the same method was applied by Landahl (1953) in the solution of the linear diffusion equation and was then generalized by Macey (1959) to the nonlinear diffusion equation (9.6) for sorption; Parlange (1971) applied the concept to derive a first estimate φ = φ(θ) = = of the soil water profile for sorption, that is (9.32) with 1 and 0.

{"text": "9.4.3 Infiltration after the start of ponding: time compression approximation Prior to the time of ponding, the precipitated water can readily enter into the soil, and the rate of infiltration is equal to the precipitation rate, as indicated by the second of Equations (9.5). Once ponding starts, the soil surface is satiated, that is , so that the boundary condition at 0 becomes the third of (9.5), which is the same as the secondof(9.62)fortheinfiltrationcapacityproblem.However,theinitialconditionatthe infiltration and related unsaturated flows startofpondingisquitedifferentfromtheinitialconditionusedtodescribetheinfiltration capacity, i.e. the first of (9.62). In fact, the initial soil water content distribution at the start of ponding cannot be prescribed in general beforehand, because it will depend on the specifics of the duration and intensity of infiltration prior to ponding for each rainfall event. Because a detailed solution of Richards’s equation for each rainfall occurrence is neitherpracticalnorfeasible,itisusefultoexplorefurthersimplificationoftheproblem. Several parameterizations of rainfall infiltration that have been proposed in the past involvetheconceptoftimecompression(alsocalledtimecondensation),orsomeassump- tion similar to it. Briefly, the underlying assumption is that the potential infiltration rate, at any given time after the onset of ponding within a rain storm period, depends only on the previous cumulative infiltration volume, regardless of the previous infiltration or rainfallhistoryduringthatsamestorm.Thetimecompressionapproximation(TCA)was introduced in the 1940s (see Sherman, 1943; Holtan, 1945) in the context of partitioning the rainfall on a watershed into runoff and infiltration, and was later applied in many other studies (see Reeves and Miller, 1975; Sivapalan and Milly, 1989; Salvucci and Entekhabi, 1994; Kim al., 1996). Conceptually, TCA can be considered another instance of the application of the lumped kinematic approach, as formulated in Equation (1.10). Thus the soil profile is a one-dimensional control volume, the rate of infiltration is the inflow rate , and the cumulative infiltration is the storage S. After the inception of ponding, the inflow rate is assumed to be a function of the storage only, independent of the precipitation history. General formulation Let (t) and F(t) denote the actual infiltration rate and actual cumulative infiltration,respectively;asthesearefunctionsoftime,onealsohastheinversefunctions for the infiltration capacity, that is under potential conditions, as analyzed in Section 9.3. and subject to boundary conditions (9.2); their inverse can be written, respectively as t( ) and t(F ). The basic assumption of TCA can be expressed as follows (t(F F)) With a constant (or average) rate of rainfall P, the cumulative infiltration at the time of incipient ponding is (Pt ). Define now the (fictitious) compression reference time as the time period after the start of rainfall that would be required to produce the same infiltrated volume, but under potential conditions. Thus one has p p c cr fromwhicht ort canbeestimated.Oncet andt areknown,thecumulativeinfiltration cr p cr p is given by F(t) for c p cr p rain infiltration In light of (9.90), the rate of infiltration is f f t t t c p cr p In Equations (9.92) and (9.93) the time to ponding and the compression reference time remain to be determined. These two variables are related by (9.91); as this is one equa- tion with two unknowns, additional information is needed to solve for and . The time to ponding is a real physical quantity, whereas the compression reference time is essentially a parameter, arising in the TCA approximation. There are two possible procedures of estimating . In the first, it is obtained from the time to ponding; the latterisestimatedindependently,frommeasurementsorwithexpressionslikeEquations (9.86) or (9.89). In the second procedure, use is made of the precipitation intensity to solve for both and by means of the TCA approximation. Estimation with the correct time to ponding In the first procedure the value of is determined independently and with a known or tolerable accuracy. The time to ponding can be measured directly, as in controlled situations during irrigation, or by appropriate observations; also, as reviewed in the previous section, there are reliable expressions available for this purpose, which are basedonthesolutionofRichards’sequation(seeParlangeandSmith,1976;Broadbridge and White, 1987). With known, one obtains then as the inverse of Equation (9.91) t(F ) (9.94) in which the subscript 1 indicates that is obtained by the first alternative procedure. Note that with this procedure the infiltration rate has a discontinuity at (see Figure 9.17). This is unavoidable, and is a result of the approximate nature of TCA. However, the basic assumption of TCA, expressed in Equation (9.90), is satisfied. Estimation from the precipitation intensity In past applications of TCA, it has usually not been assumed that the time to ponding canbedeterminedindependently.Rather,t hasusuallybeenestimatedbyassuming,that under potential conditions is the time after the start of rainfall that would be required to produce not only the same infiltrated volume, i.e. (Pt ) as at the time of ponding, but also the same infiltration rate, i.e. P. Thus one has the additional equation, from which the compression reference time is obtained as the simple inverse function t( P); the subscript 2 indicates that it is estimated by this second alternative procedure. The time to ponding can then be calculated by means of Equation (9.91) as This procedure is illustrated in Figure 9.18. In the real world, it is certainly the case that at the time of ponding both and must be satisfied. But it should be kept in mind that the TCA concept is only infiltration and related unsaturated flows Fig.9.17 Illustrationofthetimecompressionmethod,asgivenbyEquation (9.92),toestimatethecumulative F P.Inthisversionofthemethodthetimeto infiltration (heavyline),resultingfromprecipitationrate pondingisdeterminedindependently,andpresumedtobecorrect.Atthetimeofpondingt tp,the F Fc curveatt tcr,butitsslopeisnotequaltothatofthe Fc valueof isequaltothatofthe curveat t tcr;thus,theinfiltrationrate f hasadiscontinuityatt tp,buttheinfiltratedvolume F satisfies themainpremiseoftimecompression.

The time to ponding is such a crucial parameter in describing rainfall infiltration, that the first procedure to determine the compression reference time should be used, if at all possible. Because TCAismainlyconcernedwithmassconservationandcumulativeinfiltration,andlessso pointed out by J.-Y. Parlange (Liu al., 1998), the first procedure with is preferable over the second with . The following example should give an idea of the practical implementation of the TCA concept and of the error involved in the estimation of by means of the second procedure. Example 9.3. Application with truncated time expansion Theaboveequationsforrainfallinfiltrationcanbeappliedwithanyoftheavailableequa- tions for infiltration capacity or discussed in Section 9.3. The calculations become especially simple when time can be expressed explicitly as a function of infiltration capacity.Considerasanexamplethetruncatedtimeexpansion(9.75)proposedbyPhilip (1957a). By using the procedure, with the correct value of determined independently, one obtains from (9.94) for the compression reference time, implicitly and, after solution, explicitly )1/2]2/b2 = [−a + + in which and are the constants appearing in Equation (9.75). With the second procedure, which is based on the infiltration rate constraint, by combining (9.95) with (9.75) one obtains the following = [a/(P − The time to incipient ponding can be calculated by substitution of (9.98) into (9.91), which yields with the cumulative infiltration corresponding to (9.75), With the values of and known, by either of the two procedures, the cumulative F Pt t t F t t t t p cr p cr p and in a similar way, the rate of infiltration (9.93). The error involved in the second TCA procedure can be determined by comparing the the previous section. As before, for the sake of generality, especially in this comparison with another expression, it is useful to express (9.99) in dimensionless form. It should be infiltration and related unsaturated flows 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Curve1showsthescaledtimetopondingtp+ (k0 Fig.9.19 againstscaledrainfallrate Equation(9.101);therainfallrateisassumedtobeconstantduringtherainfallevent.Curve2 (9.89)withα = 0.55(whichis representsthenegativeerrorofthisresultrelativetoEquation showninFigure9.16),andthusindicatesthattp+ isunderestimatedwiththisprocedure. recalled that the constants in the infiltration equation (9.75), used in this example, can be = /2 = /3; taken as and with these values of the constants and in terms of the scaled variables shown in (9.88), Equation (9.99) can be written as 0.5(P+ −1/6) This result is illustrated in Figure 9.19, and can be compared with the more accurate result showninFigure9.16.AlsoshownistheerrorinherentinEquation(9.101)relativeto(9.89); itcanbeseenthattheerrorinthissecondprocedurecanbeconsiderable,andthatitresultsin underestimates of the time to ponding, ranging between roughly 10% and 70%, depending on the rainfall intensity. As seen in Equations (9.92) and (9.100), an underestimated time to ponding produces an underestimate of the infiltration F. Accuracy of the TCA approximation Several studies allow an assessment of the time compression approximation. One is the analysis of intermittent infiltration by Ibrahim and Brutsaert (1968), on the basis of the numerical solution of Equation (9.1) for conditions representing alternating potential infil- trationanddrainage(orredistribution)cycles.Thehysteresisinthesoilwatercharacteristic was taken into account by means of the concept of independent domain. Inspection of the results shows that the cumulative infiltration, after restarting it following a drainage period of a given duration, can be obtained by merely time-shifting the initial (i.e. prior to the drainage) cumulative potential infiltration curve over a certain time period; however, the required time-shift period tends to be shorter than the drainage period, which is the time-shift assumed under TCA. This means that TCA usually underestimates infiltration. SimilarresultswereobtainedbyReevesandMiller(1975);althoughinsomeextremecases the reported error was as large as 15% to 20%, in most cases it was considerably smaller. catchment-scale infiltration and other “losses” Liu (1998) estimated the error in the TCA solution by comparing it with the exact solutionofrainfallinfiltrationforthespecialcaseofthelinearizedRichardsequationwith- out gravitational effect, that is Equation (9.6) with a constant . The differences between the two solutions were very small, with the largest occurring near ponding. The maximal error in cumulative infiltration was found to be an underestimate of only 1.3% for and (9.96); similarly small errors were obtained for the rates of infiltration. On the other hand the second procedure underestimated the time to ponding obtained with (9.96) by about 19%. This illustrates that can be a sensitive parameter and that conversely, errors in will cause much smaller error in the resulting or f. The sensitivity issue was also dealt with by White al. (1989)."}

In applied hydrology it is usually necessary to estimate the process over larger areas, often withtypicallengthscalesontheorderofkilometers.Overtheyearsengineers,facedwith the task of predicting storm runoff from precipitation, have developed various, mostly heuristic, approaches to deal with this problem. Some of these are reviewed in what follows."}
{"text": "9.5.1 Infiltration capacity methods This approach consists of the simple extension of the available information on point infiltration over a larger area.

{"text": "9.5.2 The loss rate concept In many of the methods that have been in use to predict streamflow from rainfall obser- vations for flood-control purposes (see Feldman, 1981), it is necessary to determine a rainfallexcess,thatisthepartoftheprecipitationwhichgeneratesthedirectstormrunoff. Thisisusuallydonebyapplyingalossratetotheobservedprecipitationintensity.Mostof this“loss”isassumedtoconsistofinfiltration;however,becauseitisdifficulttoconsider them separately, other processes such as initial rainfall detention storage in depressions and rainfall interception, are usually included in the total loss. Because generally much infiltration and related unsaturated flows Fig.9.20 Astormhyetographshowingthe rainfallintensity asafunction oftime,withanassumedinitial lossandasubsequentconstant lossrate.Theremainingblank areaisconsideredtheexcess precipitation,whichproducesthe stormrunoff. of the infiltrated water participates actively in the runoff generating process, the loss rate concept is of questionable validity and not soundly based. Nevertheless, as long as its limitations are kept in mind, the concept can be useful, especially in situations with limited data and for design purposes involving large flows and floods. There have been two major ways of applying the loss rate concept; in the first, which is used more commonlyforlargebasins,itisassumedthatthelossisindependentoftherainfall,while in the second one, which is more widely used for smaller areas, the loss is assumed to be proportional to the rainfall. Loss rate independent of rainfall In this approach the loss rate is usually taken as a constant rate throughout the rainstorm event, and it is subtracted from the actual rainfall intensity to obtain the excess rainfall intensity.Theunderlyingideaisthatthislossraterepresentsmainlythespace-andtime- averaged behavior of the infiltration capacity which is controlled by the properties of the soil and which is independent of the rainfall intensities, as long as they are large enough. Several such indices have been proposed in the past, but Horton’s (1937) method has probably been most widely used. In brief, the loss rate is determined as the constant value that must be subtracted from the actual rainfall rate so that the resulting excess rainfall volume over the entire catchment is equal to the actual storm runoff volume; this storm runoff is derived from the streamflow hydrograph by subtracting the (assumed) baseflow from the total runoff. When rainfall is observed at several gages, their input must be properly weighted with their respective areas of influence (see Section 3.3.1) and several trial loss rates are required to obtain the solution. This method is often applied in modified form, by the inclusion of an initial loss, which is a certain amount that is subtracted from the rainfall at the beginning of the storm event. The principle is illustrated in Figure 9.20. The initial loss can be defined as the loss that takes place before the onset of storm runoff in the stream, and it is usually envisioned to consist of interception storage, depression storage and initial high rate catchment-scale infiltration and other “losses” 0 2 4 6 8 10 Loss rate (mm h floodestimation.Thecirclesrepresentalllossratescombinedasweightedaveragesfrom101 watershedsintheUS,24watershedsinAustraliaand8watershedsinNewZealand.Thetriangles representthesmallestlossratesobservedin60watershedsintheUnitedStates. infiltration. Various methods have been in use to determine the initial loss, but all of them have drawbacks. In the most obvious method the initial loss is taken as all the rain prior to the start of the rise in the stream flow; but this is not always applicable, because often the rain may be finished before the stream flow hydrograph shows any rise. This difficulty can be avoided by considering as initial loss the maximal isolated burst of rainfall observed in the record, which was not reflected in an obvious rise in the streamflow hydrograph. Another way is to make use of a “typical delay period,” which can be derived from the record as the delay between short, intense storms and the subsequent start of the rise in the streamflow hydrograph; when the storm is sufficiently intense, the initial loss can be assumed to be negligible. This period can then serve to determinethestartoftherainfallexcess,i.e.theendoftheinitiallossperiod,instormsof longer duration. Examples of the application of the loss rate methodology can be found shown how the initial loss can be related to an antecedent precipitation index, which he used as a measure of the wetness of the catchment. To give an idea of the values that can be expected for the constant loss rate, Figure 9.21 presents a summary of the data collection of Pilgrim (1966). The circles represent the loss rate frequency as a weighted average of 460 values from 101 water- sheds in the United States, 150 values from 24 Australian watersheds and 116 values from 8 watersheds in New Zealand; the results for the three data sets were sufficiently similar so that they could be combined in one single curve. The triangles in Figure 9.21 representthefrequencyofthesmallestlossratesobservedin60watershedsintheUnited Loss rate proportional to rainfall intensity: the runoff coefficient In the Rational Method, the peak runoff rate (Q (expressed as volume rate of flow per unit catchment area) at the outlet of a catchment is assumed to be a fraction of the infiltration and related unsaturated flows rainfall intensity, where is the area of the catchment; is a constant, also called the runoff coefficient, which ranges between 0 and 1 (see Table 12.2), depending on the nature of the surface. Although the basic approach was proposed some 150 years ago (Mulvany,1850; Dooge, 1957), various versions of the Rational Method are still in common use in the design of road culverts and other structures draining small areas of a few square kilometers at most. Equation (9.102) suggests that the rainfall loss rate is simply proportional to the losses appears to be more compatible with the early stages of rainfall infiltration (see the second condition of Equations (9.5)) combined with interception losses (see Equations appeartoreflectconditionsduringlongerlastingevents(seethethirdofEquations(9.5)) with eventually a near-constant infiltration capacity. It probably also explains the dif- ferences in the sizes of the catchments for which both methods have been applied in engineering. The Rational Method is treated in greater detail in Section 12.2.2."}

This transport takes place both in the liquid and in the vapor phase;moreover,asevaporationisdrivenbyradiationandotherenergyinputs,thetransport involves not only water pressure gradients, but often also temperature gradients with a soil heat flux. However, as already discussed in Section 8.3.3, in many situations of hydrologic interest, some important features of the evaporation at the soil surface can be obtained on the basis of the isothermal flow equation, viz. Darcy’s law (8.19). In particular, two flow problems have been the subject of previous research, that have practical relevance to soil surface evaporation; these are steady capillary rise from a water table to the surface, and unsteady desorption from a deep soil profile without a water table."}
{"text": "9.6.1 Steady capillary rise from a water table This situation occurs when the water table is maintained at a constant level, from which water flows upward through the soil profile to the soil surface, where it is taken away by evaporation under constant atmospheric conditions.

This can be readily inte- grated for a uniform soil profile, provided the capillary conductivity k(H) is known as H(= −p /γ a function of the soil water suction ). Gardner (1958) presented solutions of capillary rise and evaporation at the soil surface Equation (9.103) produces the vertical pressure distribution of the soil water for any given rate of evaporation E. For relatively low values of or for a soil profile with a water table at a shallow depth below the surface, the value of at the soil surface is relatively small, i.e. close to zero, and the soil surface is close to saturated. Hence, in such acasetherateofevaporationisgovernedbytheprevailingatmosphericconditions,andnot by the ability of the soil profile to transmit water.

For most practical purposes it is probably sufficiently accurate to assume that the actual evaporation at any time is the lesser of the potential evaporation and of the limiting evaporation . A satisfactory approximation of this limiting value can be obtained by assuming that the soil surface at is nearly dry or at field capacity, so that one can assume that and 0. Integration of Equation (9.103) with (8.37) then produces in general (Cisler, 1969) the following relationship between the limiting rate of evaporation and the depth of the water table, (cid:2) (cid:3) sin(π/c)(a +bE inwhicha,b andc aretheparametersofEquation(8.37).Sinceinmanycasesa ), this is to a good approximation (cid:2) (cid:3) sin(π/c) The assumption of isothermal capillary flow is clearly an oversimplification. Espe- cially near the soil surface, transport in the vapor phase is also likely to play a role, so that the limiting evaporation rate is probably larger than the predicted value. However, Gardner (1958) has estimated that this increase is not likely to exceed 20%. In any event, Equation (9.105) indicates that the limiting evaporation is proportional to . As shown inFigure9.22,experimentalresultsbyGardnerandFireman(1958)appeartoconfirmthis. This gives some support to the isothermal flow assumption. (Note that in Figure 9.22 the curve is similar to, but not quite the same as (9.105), because the depth of the water table was simulated in the experiment by maintaining the bottom of the 1 m long column at a negativepressureratherthanzero;however,thedifferencewasshowntobesmall.)Equation (9.103) was used by Willis (1960) to study the steady flow from a water table in the case of a soil profile consisting of two layers of different texture. He concluded that the effect of stratification was pronounced for a system with the coarse-textured soil overlying the fine-textured soil, but not for the reversed condition."}

The first and second stages of evaporation from soil it has been customary to classify bare soil evaporation under constant external conditions in the laboratory into several stages of drying; from the hydrologic point of view, the first twoofthesestagesarethemoreimportantones.Inthefirststage,whichprevailsaslongas thesoilissufficientlymoist,theevaporationrateisprimarilycontrolledbytheatmospheric conditions. It is therefore best expressed in terms of measurements in the atmosphere. For a moist surface under natural conditions, several well-known formulations are available, which make use of atmospheric variables and which are treated in Chapter 4. Obviously, for constant atmospheric conditions, the rate of drying is constant. The duration of the first stage depends on the rate of evaporation and the ability of the soil profile to supply this As the soil near the surface dries out, the water supply to the surface eventually falls below that required by the atmospheric conditions. In this second or falling-rate stage, the rateofevaporationismainlylimitedbythesoilmoistureconditionsandthesoilproperties, andmuchlessbytheavailableenergy.Thetransitionfromthefirststagetothesecondstage may be quite abrupt at a given point on the surface; on a wider scale it is usually more gradual, because local transitions at different locations tend to occur at different times. It was noted by Jackson (1976) that the transition from the first to the second stage can be observed visually by changes in color and in albedo. Inthesecondstageofdrying,watermovesalsothroughtheprofilebydiffusionofwater vapor. And especially after the soil has become quite dry, the water transport through the profile is sensitive to the temperature gradients in the soil as well. Nevertheless, at least initially in the falling rate stage, it appears that the water moves primarily as a liquid. steady case, experimental evidence has shown that some of the more important features of the falling-rate stage can be obtained by means of the isothermal flow description with Richards’s equation. capillary rise and evaporation at the soil surface Isothermal flow in the absence of gravity: desorption In a number of studies the formulation has been further simplified by considering the second stage of drying as a problem of desorption. This formulation, which was first used by Gardner (1959), is based on several additional assumptions, beside that of isothermal liquid flow. First, it is assumed that the effect of gravity is negligible. In other words, it is assumed that the drying rate of a vertical soil column is the same as that of a horizontal aretakentobesameasgivenin(9.7),exceptthatindesorption,insteadofθ ,letθ represent the water content at the dry soil surface, so that ; thus, when applied to this case, in the first of (9.7) it is assumed that the initial water content is uniform, and in the second thatthewatercontentatthesurfaceisalwaysverylow.Theseconditionsareequivalentwith the assumption that the energy-limiting drying rate is so large, that the duration of the first stage of drying is negligibly short. Third, vapor transfer in the drier soil near the surface is neglected. As was the case for the sorption problem, by applying the Boltzmann transform (9.11), Equation (9.6) can be reduced to the ordinary differential equation (9.13). Because in desorption the water content is normalized as so that, instead of (9.14), the boundary conditions are θ = θ = φ → ∞ θ = θ = φ = (or 0) 0 To date no general exact solution has been obtained for this problem, but only approximate solutions or exact solutions for certain types of diffusivity functions. Gardner (1959) made use of two solutions. One was the linearized solution obtained by means of a weighted mean diffusivity calculated by Crank’s method; his second solution, which was presented graphically, was obtained by iteration for the exponential-type diffusivity (8.39). Parlange (1985) proposed an approximate, but quite accurate method of solution for arbitrary (θ),inamannersimilartothetechniquesusedforsorption.Finally, diffusivityfunctions it has been shown by Brutsaert (1982) that there is a large class of functions that admit exact solutions for desorption as formulated by Equations (9.13) and (9.107); one such function, in particular appeared to have practical relevance to flow in soils and other porousmaterials.Adetaileddiscussionofthesemethodsofsolutionisbeyondthescopeof the present treatment.

Similar results were presented by Gardner and Hillel (1962); in addition they observed that soon after the end of the first stage of drying, the rate of evaporation is independent of the initial drying rate, and that it depends primarily on the water content of the soil. These successful experimental tests of the desorption approach were obtained under constant atmospheric conditions in the laboratory, and should lend support to the underlying assumptions. Nevertheless, it can be expected that the neglect of gravity will somehowresultinanoverestimateoftheevaporationrate,whereastheneglectofthevapor transfer must result in an underestimate of the evaporation. While these effects may be compensating each other to some extent, this will require more study."}

Nevertheless, as will be shown below, under certain conditions the assumption that soil surface evaporation takes place in two stages, and that the second stage can be described by a desorption formulation, is still a useful construct to describedryingphenomena.Butitshouldbekeptinmindthat,whenever(9.108)isapplied underconditionsotherthanthosespecifiedby(9.6)and(9.107),itdoesnotreallyrepresent a capillary desorption phenomenon, in the strict sense of the word. Therefore, the value of obtained this way is probably better referred to as “effective” desorptivity. Daily evaporation from bare soil In several field studies it was found that E(t) could be described reasonably well as a desorptionphenomenonbyEquation(9.108),providedthiswasdonewithdailytimesteps. et al. t was set to zero after each heavy rainfall, and daily evaporation from a bare soil lysimeter measured during an entire summer. The measurements illustrated in Figure 9.24 suggested d−1/2.Interestingly,thisvaluewasalso aneffectivedesorptivityofaround cm =0.43cmd−1/2,calculatedbymeansofCrank’s notverydifferentfromthedesorptivityDe linearizedsolution.Inlightofthenaturalvariabilityofthesoil,andalsoofthelikelyerrors stemmingfromtheproblemformulationanditslinearization,thedifferenceissmall.Black etal.(1969)suspectedthatafterarainfalltheevaporationwouldeventuallydepartfromthe relationship,becauseofthefinitedepthofwetting.Still,itwaspossibletosimulatean entiresummerofevaporationthisway.InasimilarstudyinCalifornia,Parlangeetal.(1992) assumed that daily evaporation from a bare soil lysimeter followed the pattern of (9.108) immediatelyafterirrigationofthefield;withthisassumptiontheirmeasurementssuggested d−1/2.InArizona,Jacksonetal.(1976)foundthat aneffectivedesorptivity cm Equation(9.108)couldbeusedtodescribethesecondstageofdryingonadailybasisfrom infiltration and related unsaturated flows 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 T e m p e r a t u r e , T ( ) inmmd−1/2,asmeasuredbya Fig.9.25 Thetemperaturedependencyoftheeffectivedesorptivity weighinglysimeterwithloaminArizona(opencircles),andofthenormalizedwatervapor diffusivity(curve).Theindicatedtemperatureistheaverageofthefivedailyaveragesforthe firstfivedaysofthesoil-limitingphase.(AfterJacksonetal.,1976.) thoseportionsofafieldwhosesurfacemoisturecontentwasbelowacertainthresholdvalue; however,theyalsofoundthat exhibitsastrongdependencyontemperature,varyingby afactorofabout2fromwintertosummer.InFigure9.25thesemeasuredvaluesof can be compared with the normalized temperature dependency of the water vapor diffusivity; the similarity of both dependencies suggests that vapor diffusion contributes substantially to the total water transport in the top layer of the soil. Inthesethreefieldstudieswithdailytimesteps,thetransitionbetweenthefirstandsecond stage of drying appears to have been relatively abrupt. Jackson (1976) concluded that at the field scale any gradual transition was mainly caused by the variability of the surface soilmoisture,sothatthefieldwaspartlyinthefirstandinthesecondstageofdrying.Inthe analyses of the bare-soil lysimeter measurements by Black (1969) and by Parlange (1992), the desorptive stage was assumed to have started immediately after the water application had ceased, and the first stage was dispensed with. Time compression approximation Inthetwobare-soillysimeterstudiesjustmentioned,thedesorptionformulationwasimple- (cid:23) mented by simply plotting the cumulative evaporation against the square root of time to fit a linear relation through the origin, and the end of the precipitation or the irriga- tion was taken as the starting point. Whenever the first stage is short or nonexistent, this procedure may be acceptable. However, because Equation (9.108) is a nonlinear function of t, the choice of the starting point of the second drying stage, i.e. 0, is critical for its proper performance. In many situations considerable evaporation can take place under firststagedryingconditionsandthetransitioncanalsobelong;thusingeneral,thisstarting point is not known and a different approach is needed. To obtain a more objective procedure, it was proposed by Brutsaert and Chen (1995) thatEquation(9.108)shouldberecastintermsofarelativetimet (t ),inwhicht is capillary rise and evaporation at the soil surface First stage Transition Time, (days) Fig.9.26 SketchofamethodtodeterminethetwostagesofdryingbymeansofEquation (9.110). (AfterBrutsaertandChen, 1995.) a time shift parameter. Then after fitting data of against t, in accordance with (9.108) one can derive and from the slope and intercept as sketched in Figure 9.26. In order to represent the cumulative evaporation as a function of in the range of validity of (9.108), the sketch illustrates that the starting point of the integration should be , = +t = = +t 0 r0 r 0 r0 variable starts its linear relation with . The cumulative evaporation after the onset of the desorptive regime is then (cid:24) ) (9.111) in which the subscript 2 indicates the second stage of drying. The value of , marking the beginning of the second stage, can be related to the value of the cumulative evaporation at (cid:23) the end of the first stage, or of the transition if there is one, say , as follows Thus (9.111) can also be expressed as (cid:24) (cid:24) As mentioned, (9.110) can be used as a regression equation with experimental data to estimate the values of the effective parameters and ; with a known or decided upon (cid:23) value of , Equation (9.113) allows the prediction of the cumulative evaporation after the onset of the second stage of drying. Conceptually, it can be seen that this procedure is in fact based on a time compression assumption, which is analogous with that used to describe rainfall infiltration after the infiltration and related unsaturated flows start of ponding, as described in Section 9.4.3. This means that the evaporation rate at the beginning of its desorptive phase is assumed to depend mostly on the water left in the soil profileandmuchlessonthepriorevaporationhistory.Thisassumptionisconsistentwiththe observationsofGardnerandHillel(1962)underconstantlaboratoryconditions,mentioned in Section 9.6.2. The effect of vegetation The two-stage concept with the desorption approach for the second stage was originally developed for evaporation from bare soil. However, it was concluded by Brutsaert and Chen (1995) that the desorption formulation can also be put to use in the description of daily evaporation from grassland and other similar types of short vegetation. From their analysis of experimental data obtained during several drying episodes in a natural tallgrass prairie area in Kansas during FIFE, the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (see Sellers al., 1992), the following sequence of events appears to take place. Initially after rain, both soil surfaceandvegetationevaporateatarategovernedbytheavailablesupplyonly;thiscanbe considered as a first stage of drying. (In this particular experimental setting, the first-stage behavior lasted as long as the volumetric soil moisture in the top 10 cm was in excess of 27%.) As the surface soil moisture becomes depleted below this first critical level, the watersupplyratetothesoilsurfacebecomesalimitingfactor,butatfirsttheplantrootsare still able to extract water from the soil at the energy-limiting rate. This may be referred to as the transition stage. In this stage the combined rate of evaporation from the surface and from the vegetation continues to decrease, until a second critical state of soil moisture is reached.(Intheexperimentthissecondcriticalstatewasreachedwhenthemoisturecontent went below about 17% and the vertical gradient started to exceed about 1.15% 5 cm.) At this point the vegetation becomes so stressed and relatively inactive that the drying takes place mainly from the soil surface; from that point on the daily evaporation proceeds like in a second stage of drying and it can be described simply by a desorption formulation, that is proportional to the square root of time. The transition period can last from several days to two weeks, depending on the soil moisture conditions and on the season.Thelongertransitionperiodswereobservedunderconditionsoflowernetradiation and of higher soil moisture content at depths in excess of 50 cm. These results were in contrast with the observations of relatively abrupt transitions for bare soil. Example 9.4. A monthlong drought period in tallgrass prairie The longest documented drying episode during the FIFE experiment occurred in the fall of 1987. After a major rainfall event on day 253 (September 10) and minor rainfalls on days258and259,norainfelluntilday288(October15).(SeealsoFigures2.22and4.12.) The recorded daily evaporation remained larger than the equilibrium evaporation (see Equation (4.30)) until day 258, when the near-surface soil moisture content was 0.303. The evaporation rate became equal to on day 259 and it dropped below it after that; therefore, day 260 was taken to be the start of the transition stage. In order to determine the end of the transition, the data were then analyzed as suggested by Equation (9.110), −271)×10−4,in andlinearregressionyielded,asshowninFigure9.27,(L E)istheaveragedailylatentheatfluxinWm−2 which(L andt thetimeasdayoftheyear.

The effective desorptivity derived from the slopes in Figures 9.27 and 9.28 is approximately 0.495 cm Although this value of was obtained for a grassy surface, it is of the same order as values reported for other studies with bare soil. As mentioned, for a sandy soil Black (1969) derived 0.496 cm from lysimeter measurements. Ritchie (1972) et al.

Clearly, this phenomenon will require further study. Diurnal variation by self-preservation approximation catchment hydrology the daily times scale is a common one; nevertheless, in many applicationsadailytimeresolutionistoocoarse,andtimestepsof30minto1harerequired. Further analysis of the same data observed over natural prairie, discussed in the previous section, also indicated (Brutsaert and Chen, 1996) that, while the total daily evaporation could be described with a dependency, this day-to-day evolution is modulated during thedaybytheavailableenergyatthesurface,thatisbythehourlyradiationinput.Moreover, during the daytime hours the surface energy budget often displays self-similarity or self- preservation, in the sense discussed in Section 4.3.4. This dual structure of the evaporative evolution during very dry conditions suggests that it can be described, by combining the desorptionparameterization(9.108)forthetotaldailyevaporation,orforanydimensionless counterpart(suchastheevaporativefractionEF,thePriestley–Taylorα andpossiblyothers), with the assumption of self-preservation as expressed in Equation (4.51). The combination of these two concepts yields the following evaporation rate at time of day , E De F F i 0d d 0 i references wheret isthetimeshiftparameter,andthesubscriptsdandirefertodailyandinstantaneous (sayinpractice,hourlyorhalf-hourly)variables,respectively; istheaveragefluxonday of some other flux term (beside the latent heat flux) in the surface energy budget, which can be assumed to exhibit a similar diurnal variation as the evaporation rate; is that flux at time of the same day. Thus Equation (9.114) contains two time scales, in units of days, and in units of hours. As illustrated in Figure 9.29, by assuming thisformulationwasabletoreproducedaytimehourlyfluxvaluesoveraperiodof2weeks during the second stage of drying already considered in Example 9.4. The approach was subsequently applied again and validated in a different experiment by Port´ e-Agel al. (2000),whoobtainedsimilarresults.Undertherightcircumstances,theapproachbasedon Equation (9.114) may be useful in the disaggregation of daily, or even weekly, evaporation into hourly values, when more complete information is lacking.

After the precipitation or other input has ceased for some time, the entire streamflow can be assumed to consist of the cumulative outflow from all upstream phreatic aquifers. The prediction of base flow is of some practical importance because it is the rate of flow, that a given river basin can sustain in the absence of precipitation and in the absence of artificial storage works. Accordingly, this type of flow is variously known as flow, flow, base drought low and or runoff. In engineering such flows have been studied flow sustained fair-weather in connection with problems of water supply and water quality in rivers during drought periods, and general basin and agricultural drainage. During, and in response to, precipitation or snowmelt, the different pathways and the detailed mechanisms, by which water reaches the stream, are more complex than during drought flow episodes. Still, as will be seen in Chapter 11, it is generally agreed that also storm runoff from natural basins with vegetation is largely supplied into the streams by subsurface transport. Thus, subsurface drainage from the aquifers along the banks is one ofthekeyelementsincatchmenthydrology,notonlyunderdroughtconditionsbutalsoin responsetoprecipitation.Inthischapter,thesubsurfaceoutflowisfirstconsideredlocally at the point where it enters the stream, by analysis of the groundwater flow process in the riparian unconfined aquifer; the first five sections describe the different formulations that are available for this purpose. In the last section of the chapter, the phenomenon is treated at the basin scale, by integration of these local groundwater outflows along the streams and channels in the basin."}
{"text": "10.1.1 General formulation A typical cross section of an unconfined aquifer, whose water flows into the adjoining stream, is sketched in Figure 10.1. As this flow system is usually relatively shallow and exposed to the atmosphere through a partly saturated soil moisture zone, the water pressures and effective stresses are rarely very large, so that the water and the solid matrix can be assumed to be incompressible (see Brutsaert and El-Kadi, 1984, 1986). Therefore, if the material can be assumed to be effectively isotropic, the flow, which involves combined saturated and partly saturated conditions, is in principle governed by flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer Soil surface Impermeable layer Fig.10.1 Sketchofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedriparianaquifer.WTreferstothewatertable,whichisthe locuswherethewaterpressureisatmospheric;abovetheWTthesoilispartlysaturated.Thedivideis assumedtobethecatchmentboundary. =(z + /γ inwhichh )isthehydraulichead,z theverticalcoordinate,k thehydraulic conductivity and the water content of the aquifer. The boundary conditions can be prescribed in broad terms as follows. At the bedrock or impermeable bed underlying the aquifer and at the catchment divide, the flux is usually parallel to the boundary, or if is the coordinate normal to the boundary, 0. At the ground surface, the specific flux across the boundary can be given as the evaporation E, as the infiltration rate , or as a combination of both; for simplicity, however, in the analysis of base flow it is often assumed to be zero, so that here also 0. At the stream channel boundary, the hydraulic head is a constant that is equal to the height of the water surface in the stream above the reference level of the elevation, 0. Along the stream banks there is often a seepage surface, where the pressure is atmospheric, so that z. The initial conditions may vary, depending on the assumed initial moisture content distribution. This problem is not easy to solve. Aquifer properties are generally not spatially θ = θ(x, uniform and may even change with time; thus beside y, z, t) as the dependent variable,twoadditionalnonlinearfunctionscomeintoplay;thesearek and in which, as before, is the suction expressed as equivalent water column. At present there are no methods available to determine the spatial variability of these parameter functions. Moreover, in geological deposits with an irregular geometry like that of the aquifer profile shown in Figure 10.1, the boundaryconditionsprevailunderground,andtheyareinvisible;theyarethereforenearly impossible to validate or to formulate precisely. A general solution of this problem is obviously unattainable. Nevertheless, some crucial features of the flow phenomena can be brought out by the solution of special cases and simplified geometries. One common simplification consists of the adoption of “effective” parameter functions; the basic concept was introduced in Section 1.4.3. In brief, it is based on the groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.2 Schematicrepresentationofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedriparianaquifer,lyingonahorizontal impermeablelayer.Theoriginofthecoordinatesistakenatthestream(x 0)andatthe impermeablelayer(z Dc D 0); isthewaterdepthintheadjoiningstream, istheaquiferthickness, and istheaquiferbreadth,thatisthedistancefromthestreamtothedivide.Thewatertable(WT), isthelocuswherethewaterpressure isatmospheric,or 0.AbovetheWTthesoilispartly saturated,andthewaterpressuresmallerthanatmospheric;belowtheWTthewaterpressureis largerthanatmospheric. assumption that it is possible to define (or imagine) a spatially uniform model aquifer, with effective parameter functions and which, upon solution of Equation (10.1) with appropriate boundary conditions, produces the same flow charac- teristics of interest, as the real spatially variable prototype aquifer. A second simplifi- cation is based on the observation that the vertical dimensions of unconfined riparian aquifers tend to be much smaller than their horizontal extent. This has led to the assump- tion that the boundary conditions of real aquifers are rarely very different from those of a two-dimensional model aquifer of rectangular cross section; for purposes of flow analysis, the aquifer depicted in Figure 10.1 can thus be represented schematically as shown in Figure 10.2. These two simplifications have allowed some standardization of the groundwater outflow problem, while maintaining its main characteristics."}
{"text": "10.1.2 Some common approximate formulations Even with the simplifications just mentioned, the governing Richards equation (10.1) remains highly nonlinear and most problems involving combined saturated and partially saturated flow must be analyzed by numerical methods. With the availability of high speeddigitalcomputers,atpresentthereisnodearthofefficientnumericalcodesforthis purpose, and rapid advances continue to be made in this field. One drawback of such exactsolutionsof(10.1),however,isthattheycannotbeeasilyparameterizedinpractical terms for incorporation in basin-scale analyses. Thus further simplifications, which may be valid under special conditions and for which solutions may be more readily obtained, are often called for. In a first approximation the flow in the zone above the water table, where 0, is neglected, and the water table is treated as a true free surface; with the assumption of an effective hydraulic conductivity and porosity, the governing equation (10.1) reduces then to Laplace’s. This case is discussed in Section 10.2. In a second approximate for- mulation,besidethefreesurfaceassumption,thedistributionofthewaterpressureinthe generaldirectionnormaltotheflowisassumedtobehydrostatic;thesetwoassumptions, also called the Dupuit assumptions, are the basis of the hydraulic groundwater theory, flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer which is covered in Section 10.3. Linearization of the hydraulic groundwater approach constitutes a third approximate formulation, and this is covered in Section 10.4. Finally, the additional assumption that the hydraulic head gradient is equal to the slope of the land surface produces a kinematic wave formulation, which is the fourth approximation, treated in Section 10.5. But before looking more closely into these common simplified approaches in the remainder of this chapter, it is useful first to consider briefly some implications of solutions of Equation (10.1) itself."}
{"text": "10.1.3 A few features of combined saturated–unsaturated flow Unsteady flow formulation Some results of a numerical solution of Equation (10.1) were presented by Verma and Brutsaert (1970; 1971b) for the two-dimensional case of outflow from a horizontal unconfined aquifer with a rectangular cross section, after the cessation of recharge; this situation is illustrated in Figure 10.2. The soil water characteristic was assumed to be given by Equation (8.15) and the hydraulic conductivity by Equation (8.36). With the effectivesaturation definedinEquation(8.6),theboundaryconditionsforthisproblem can be specified as follows = = 1.0 = ≤ ≤ h D S x z D = = 1.0 = ≤ = h z S x D z h = = = ≤ ≤ = = = ≤ ≤ = = ≤ ≤ = 0 0 0 z 0 = = ≤ ≤ = The first boundary condition is a result of the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the stream. At the seepage surface the pressure is zero (i.e. atmospheric) and the hydraulic head is equal to the height z, as indicated in the second condition. Above the seepage surface the water pressure is negative, and because no outflow is physically possible unless the pressure is at least atmospheric, this surface acts as an impermeable boundary as indicated in the third of (10.2). The boundary conditions given by the fourth and fifth of (10.2) express the no-flow or impermeable boundaries of the aquifer at the divide and at the underlying bed rock. As it is assumed that there is no evaporation or recharge, the ground surface acts like an impermeable boundary after the drainage starts, as indicated inthelastcondition;however,thisconditionatthegroundsurfacecanbereadilyreplaced by the evaporative flux or recharge rate, if it is known. The initial conditions, for 0, can be assumed to be those of a fully saturated aquifer, in which the water table coincides with the ground surface. This situation is groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.3 Initialstatefortheunconfinedriparianaquifer,shownin Figure10.2.Thewatertable(WT)is assumedtobeatthesoilsurfaceandtheentireaquiferissaturated. formulated as S x B z D h D x B z D = = 1.0,whichisassumedtobeaneffectivehydraulicconductivitythat Sincek at isconstantoverthewholeflowdomain,Equation(10.1)reducestotheLaplaceequation, as indicated in Equation (10.3). This initial state of the aquifer is shown in Figure 10.3. Similarity criteria By scaling the variables, it can readily be seen, that the only relevant (dimensionless) thegeometryoftheflow,viz. and geometry, viz. (aD). Because in Equation (8.15) can be considered a measure of thethicknessofthecapillaryfringe,(aD)−1 expressestherelativeimportanceofcapillarity, and thus of the partly saturated flow zone, with respect to the vertical dimensions of the aquifer. Results of some example calculations for and are shown in Figure 10.4, with 3, and 3 in 8,(aD)−1 = = 0.36, = 1.5 Figure 10.5, and with and in Figure 10.6. The values of theparameters(mainly(aD)−1 andb)for Figures10.4and10.6couldrepresent,forexam- ple, a loam soil in an aquifer of approximately 3 m depth; those of Figure 10.5 a somewhat coarser material in an aquifer of roughly the same depth. These calculations show that the water table tends to fall faster for higher values of and for smaller values of b; but the value of does not appear to affect this very much. This illustrates that in real situations where capillary effects are important, it may be deceiving to use the water table as an upper boundary of the flow domain, because a large amount of water may be left in the unsaturated zone above the water table. It can also be observed that for large values of and after large the lines of equal hydraulic head are close to horizontal outside the zone of saturation, whereas they are more nearly vertical within this zone. This refraction phenomenon is mainly the result of the fact that the upper boundary of the saturated zone constitutes a boundary between a zone of high and a zone of low conductivity. The results of these numerical experiments can be used to derive similarity criteria to determine different regimes of flow in unconfined aquifers by comparing them with the results of special solutions for each of these regimes (Verma and Brutsaert, 1971a, b). In principle, all three parameters n, and b which involve soil characteristics, should flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer (a) t+ = 0.013 (b) t+ = 0.518 (d) t+ = 4.762 (c) t+ = 2.274 Fig.10.4 Successivepositionsofthewatertable(dashedline)andoflinesofequalhydraulichead 1.0,(aD)−1 (solidlines),inanaquiferwith andBrutsaert,1970.) represent some aspect of the transport in the partly saturated flow zone. However, the numerical calculations show that the effect of a change in alone is very small, and also that the calculated outflow rates are relatively insensitive to changes in of only a few units.Becausen andb usuallyvarywithinamodestrangeformostsoils,theyarerelatively unimportant as compared with This is illustrated in Figures 10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10.InFigures10.9and10.10theoutflowrateisshownforanaquiferwhosebreadth hasbeenincreasedfrom1to5.(Thesaturatedtwo-dimensionalcasewithafreesurface(see Section 10.2 below) is shown for comparison.) Comparing these two figures, one sees that thedifferencebetweencurve1and2decreasesas B+increases.Thustheeffectofdecreasing from 0.36 to 0.10 becomes less pronounced as increases. This suggests that in nature, where the values of are usually much larger than the values considered here, the effect of capillarity is likely to be even more pronounced than these numerical results groundwater outflow and base flow (a) = 0.013 (b) = 0.518 (c) = 2.274 (d) = 4.762 1.0,(aD)−1 Dc+ n 3andb Fig.10.5 SameasFigure10.4foranaquiferwith 3.

In any event, these results show that it is mainly that can be used to determine whether or not the capillary flow above the water table is important. Equation (8.15), from which the parameter was obtained for these numerical exper- iments, may not always be the optimal way to parameterize the soil-water characteristic. Therefore, it is useful to broaden this criterion by defining a capillary zone number Ca (10.4) in which is a characteristic suction (negative pressure) required to reduce the degree of saturation of the soil to a certain fraction. This dimensionless quantity Ca can be imple- mented with the other expressions presented in Section 8.2.4 as well. For instance in the case of Equation (8.14) one can simply put Ca (H It should be recalled that in Equation (8.15) the parameter represents the (negative) pressure head to reduce the flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer 1.0,(aD)−1 Fig.10.6 SameasFigure10.4foranaquiferwith 8and = 1.5.(FromVermaandBrutsaert, water content to of its value at saturation. In general, when Ca or is small, the partly saturated zone is relatively thin, and vice versa.

Kirkham (1950) derived it by generalizing an earlier solution in cylindrical coordinates for the problem of flow into an groundwater outflow and base flow auger hole. It can also be derived by conformal mapping (Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952). However, separation of variables in the present coordinate system is probably the most straightforward. The result for the hydraulic head can be written as follows (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:6) n=1,3,5,... nπ(B − nπB cosh (10.7) Outflow rate =0,expressedasvolumeofwater Therateofflowintotheopenchannelorwaterbodyat per unit time and per unit length of channel (i.e. per unit width of aquifer normal to the main direction of the flow in the aquifer), can be derived by applying Darcy’s law to the solution (10.7), to wit (cid:8) (cid:8) or (10.8) q dz q dx which yield in either case cos tanh (10.9) n=1,3,... The minus sign in front of the right-hand side indicates that the outflow is in the negative direction. To allow comparison with other solutions and with experimental data, it is once again convenient to scale the variables and express the result in dimensionless terms. The form of Equation (10.9) suggests immediately the following Thus (10.9) assumes the form nπD nπB+ cos tanh (10.11) n=1,3,...

As already hinted in the second of(10.13), which describes theseepagesurface,thetimevariableenterstheproblemthroughtheconditionatthefree surface, which constitutes the moving upper boundary. Before deriving this free surface condition, it is necessary to introduce the concept of the drainable porosity. Drainable porosity As the water table passes a point, say in the case of drainage when it is falling, the pores do not empty immediately, but the water is retained by capillarity and other mechanisms mentioned in Section 8.2.2; it is only when the water pressure decreases further, i.e. with increasing suction, as illustrated in Figures 8.3–8.6, that water drains from the pores. In the free surface approximation, the reality of this gradual transition is replaced by the assumption of the porosity, . This drainable porosity, which is also called drainable n the or the yield, can be defined as the volume of water per unit effective porosity specific volume of porous material, that is released or imbibed, as the free surface passes a given point. In general, the amount of water present in the pores at a point depends on the local water pressure. From this it follows that the drainable porosity must depend on the prevailingwaterpressuredistributionabovethewatertableandthereforeonthenatureof theflowsituation.Figure10.12furtherillustrateshowtheconceptcanbeinterpretedwith referencetothesoilwatercharacteristic.Itcanbeseenthatn dependsonthevalueofthe maximum suction in the soil column above the water table; because )max changes with time during unsteady flow, in principle may also be time dependent to some free surface flow extent. As shown, the soil water characteristic curve in Figure 10.12 describes drainage; obviously, consideration of repeated draining and wetting cycles with hysteresis would complicate the matter even more. This means that the drainable porosity cannot be a unique physical property of a given porous material, and that it must be considered as a mere parameter that is to be adjusted and calibrated depending on the flow problem. This is its main limitation, which should be kept in mind in practical applications of the free surface approach in flow in porous media. But if this limitation is kept in mind, the concept can yield useful results in the parameterization of groundwater flow processes at the field and catchment scales. Free surface condition In principle, the condition at the free surface in a porous material is again Equation (5.1) as presented in Chapter 5. If the function 0 describing the free surface is taken as = = [η( = η the reference level 0, this can be written as −w + = = η 0 at (10.14) in which, as before, and represent the x- and z-components of the true fluid velocity, which is also that of the free surface. Thevelocityofafluidisitsvolumetricrateofflowperunitcross-sectionalareaoccupied by this fluid. Because the specific flux in Darcy’s equation is the volumetric flow rate per unit cross-sectional area of total or bulk porous material, it does not represent the true velocity of the fluid particles (cf. Section 8.3.1). Rather, with the assumption of a drainable porosity, the actual velocity of the fluid particles must be taken as ). Therefore, with (q ) and (q ) as the x- and z-components of the velocity of the fluid and also of the free surface, Equation (10.14) becomes, in terms of the Darcy flux, −q +n = = η 0 at (10.15) With Darcy’s law one obtains finally ∂η ∂h ∂η ∂h = − = η = at (10.16) ∂t ∂x ∂x ∂z There is also a second way of implementing Equation (5.1) in a porous material to formulate the condition at the free surface. If the adopted free surface function is ∂h ∂h ∂h 0 at (10.17) ∂x ∂z ∂t from which one obtains the free surface condition, as an alternative to Equation (10.16), ∂h ∂h 2 ∂h 2 ∂h = + − = η = at (10.18) ∂t ∂x ∂z ∂z Either (10.16) or (10.18) can be used in the solution of the problem; the choice depends usually on the specific mathematical aspects to be investigated. groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.13 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofEquation water table (10.16)tocalculatethe rateofdrawdownofthe watertable(WT),when treatedasafree surface.The equipotentialsarelines equipotential ofconstanthydraulic h.(AfterKirkham andGaskell,1951.) streamline equipotential Example 10.1.

{"text": "10.3 HYDRAULIC GROUNDWATER THEORY: A SECOND APPROXIMATION Free surface representations of flow in unconfined aquifers, as outlined in Section 10.2, are usually easier to solve than those based on Richards’s equation, which include also flowinthepartlysaturatedzoneabovethewatertable.Nevertheless,theimplementation of this simplification for problems in catchment hydrology is rarely straightforward and, even when obtainable, the resulting solutions can usually not readily be parameterized for this purpose. Therefore, further simplifications are called for. One very common approachisbasedontheobservationthatunconfinedaquifersinnaturalcatchmentstend to be relatively thin compared to their horizontal extent. Thus beside the assumption that thewatertableisatruefreesurface,itisalsoassumedthatundersuchconditions,theflow is essentially parallel to the ground surface and/or to the underlying impermeable bed. Specifically, the first assumption requires that the capillary zone number Ca is small, whereas the second requires that the aquifer is shallow, so that is large. These two assumptions constitute the basis of the hydraulic groundwater theory. It will become clear below that the hydraulic approach is considerably simpler and more parsimonious than the more complete formulations described in Sections 10.1 and 10.2; moreover,inmanysituationsitproducesasolutionwhichisquiteclosetothatobtainable byamorecompleteformulation.Hencenotsurprisingly,thisapproachcontinuestobethe method of choice in many investigations. The hydraulic approach is usually attributed to Dupuit (1863). It has also been referred to as the Dupuit–Forchheimer theory, to acknowledge the fact that Forchheimer (1930) applied it to many different problems."}
{"text": "10.3.1 General formulation The governing differential equations for this approach can be derived by combining the continuity equation with Darcy’s law adjusted for the hydraulic assumptions. Adjustment of Darcy’s law The main assumption is essentially the same as that commonly made for open channel flow. It is that the curvature of the streamlines is very small, so that the pressure distri- bution is practically hydrostatic in the direction normal to the impermeable bed. For the two-dimensional cross section of the aquifer shown in Figure 10.15, Equation (5.5) is directly applicable and can be rewritten as + γ cosα = 0 (10.23) inwhichα istheslopeangleoftheunderlyingimpermeablelayer,and isthecoordinate normal to that layer. Observe that with a sloping bed and are related with the vertical hydraulic groundwater theory Fig.10.15 Definitionsketchfor two-dimensional Soil surface groundwaterflowwitha watertable(WT)above aslopingimpermeable layer(IL).TheWTis assumedtobeatruefree surfaceoftheflowing water,andflowabove theWTisneglected. coordinate by and Integration of Equation (10.23) = γ cosα (η − whereη = η(x,t)istheheightofthewatertable,againmeasuredinthedirectionnormal totheimpermeablebed.FromEquation(10.24)itfollowsthat,foraconstantbedslopeα, the pressure gradient in the direction of flow is given by = γ cosα This shows that this gradient depends only on the slope of the free surface, and is independent of z; put differently, is a constant along the direction normal to the impermeable bed. For a fluid of constant density the hydraulic head is Equation (8.18) = ζ + /γ or in the present notation . With (10.25) the hydraulic gradient becomes = cosα + sinα Hence, under the assumption of hydraulic flow, Darcy’s equation yields the specific flux (cid:2) (cid:3) = −k cosα + sinα which, as observed below Equation (10.25), is a constant in any given cross section normal to the underlying bed at a distance from the origin. A derivation of (10.27) was in both instances the approach differed somewhat from the one given here. groundwater outflow and base flow Equation of continuity Because is a constant along z, it is identical with the average, and the continuity equation(5.13)derivedforfreesurfaceopenchannelflowisalsodirectlyapplicablehere. In (5.13) the term representing the displacement rate of the free surface becomes in the present notation. Because this is an actual velocity of the interface, the average velocity in (5.13) must be replaced here by the “true” velocity in the porous material (q ); similarly, the lateral inflow must be replaced by a true recharge velocity ), where is the recharge rate, representing a source term as a volumetric flux per unit ground surface area of porous material. Thus one obtains (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 (10.28) With (10.27) this assumes the form ∂η ∂ ∂η ∂η = cosα η + sinα + ∂t ∂x ∂x ∂x in which it is assumed, as is commonly done, that and are constant or can be treated as effective parameters. In the absence of lateral inflow and for a horizontal impermeable layer, Equation (10.29) becomes (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂t ∂x ∂x Both (10.29) and (10.30) are forms of what is usually referred to as the Boussinesq equation. To repeat, the Boussinesq equation is based on the following assumptions. (i) The effect of unsaturated flow above the water table is negligible and it can be parameterized by an effective porosity or specific yield ; this is also the basis of the free surface approach (i.e. the first approximation). (ii) The pressure distribution in the direction normal to the bed is hydrostatic, which leads to (10.27), which is the basis of the hydraulic approach (i.e the second approximation). The derivation of Equations (10.29) and (10.30) is presented here for a two- dimensional cross section of an unconfined aquifer. It is straightforward to consider the more general case of three-dimensional flow, with as the coordinate pointing up the slope along the impermeable bed, and as the horizontal lateral or span-wise coor- dinate, to obtain a more general form of the Boussinesq equation, namely = cosα η + sinα + η + Mathematically,Equation(10.31)canbecharacterizedasanonlinearadvectivediffusion equation, with a variable (i.e. a function of and anisotropic hydraulic (groundwater) = ηcosα/n = η/n diffusivity,whosetwoprincipalcomponentsare and , hx 0 e hy 0 e = −k sinα/n and with a hydraulic (groundwater) advectivity . A basic feature of the hydraulic approach is that two-dimensional flow is represented by a one-dimensional formulation in Equations (10.29) and (10.30); thus the unknown hydraulic head h(x, z, t) is replaced by the unknown position of the water table hydraulic groundwater theory Fig.10.16 Schematicrepresentationofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedriparianaquifer,lyingonahorizontal impermeablelayer,understeadyflowconditions.Thepositionofthewatertableresultsfromasteady Ic,andithastheshapeofanellipsewithoutseepagesurfaceat x andconstantrechargerate 0,when determinedwiththehydraulicapproach. η=η(x,t).Similarly,three-dimensionalflowissimplifiedtoatwo-dimensionalproblem unknown height of the water table (x, y, t)."}
{"text": "10.3.2 Steady flow described with hydraulic theory Over the years hydraulic groundwater theory has been a powerful tool to solve a large number of important practical problems under steady state conditions. The main reason for its wide use is that under steady state conditions the Boussinesq equation becomes linear in which greatly simplifies the mathematical analysis. For instance, under conditions of steady flow over a horizontal bed and in the absence of lateral inflow, Equation (10.31) reduces to ∂2η2 ∂2η2 0 (10.32) This is Laplace’s equation in for which many solution methods are available. More- over,becausetheproblemislinear,knownsolutionsforη2 obtainedforrelativelysimple boundary conditions can be extended to more complicated situations by the application of image methods and other methods of superposition. Two examples of steady aquifer outflow are presented in what follows. Steady outflow resulting from a uniform precipitation Under steady conditions and for an aquifer cross section with horizontal bed, as shown in Figure 10.16, one can write Equation (10.29) as (cid:2) (cid:3) where is a constant recharge rate; this is usually taken as a climatological average rainfall for design purposes, but it may also represent irrigation or a negative rate of groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.17 Examplesofscaledwatertable heightη/B asafunctionofscaled distance fromthe drainagechannelfordifferent 0.3 valuesofthescaledrechargerate andwaterlevel intheopenchannel, calculatedwithEquation (10.37)for theconditionsshowninFigure 10.16.Curve1represents = 0.1and = 0.1;curves2 and3represent = 0.1and0.01,respectively. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Eachcurveisaquarterellipse. evaporation from the water table or seepage through the bed, or any combination of several of these rates.

Integrating (10.33) twice, one obtains for the height of the water table η2 = − + (2Bx (10.35) Actually,thisresultcanalsobederiveddirectlywithoutformalrecoursetotheBoussinesq equation, by simply observing that at any point according to (10.27) the rate of flow Equation (10.35) can be generalized, to facilitate comparison with experimental results and other theoretical approaches, by scaling the variables as follows and (10.36) This transforms (10.35) into 2x+ (10.37) This result is illustrated in Figure 10.17 for a few examples. Application of Equation (10.35) to B, where the water table has its maximal height , yields immediately (cid:12) (cid:13) Equation (10.38) was originally intended as a design equation, to determine the spacing (2B) of drainage ditches or underground pipe drainage systems of agricultural lands; hydraulic groundwater theory Fig.10.18 Schematicrepresentationofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedaquifer,lyingonahorizontal impermeablelayerbetweentwoopenchannelswithconstantwaterlevels.Ifthewatertable(WT)is assumedtobeafreesurface,theresultingsteadyflowrateq betweenthetwochannelsisgivenexactly bytheDupuitformula(10.43).ThesolidcurverepresentsthetrueWTwithaseepagesurfaceandthe dashedcurvetheWTobtainedwiththehydraulicapproach. in fact, with a number of subsequent improvements it still provides the basis for many of the soil drainage design procedures in use today. In order to apply it in its original form, the variables on the right-hand side of Equation (10.38) must be known or decided upon. Thus is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, is taken as the average rate of precipitation or other input during the period when drainage is needed most, is the depth of the water in the drainage channel or, to a first approximation, the height of the drainage pipe above the impermeable layer, and is the main design vari- able, namely the maximal allowable height of the water table above the impermeable Equation (10.38) has a long history. It is now often referred to as the ellipse equation, on account of the shape of the water table given by Equation (10.35) (see Figure 10.17). ItwasprobablyfirstderivedbyA.ColdinginDenmarkbefore1872forthecase 0, afterhebecameawareofearlierexperimentalresultspublishedin1859byS.C.Delacroix in France; interestingly, he also recommended a 10% reduction of any value obtained with Equation (10.38), to make it agree better with these experimental data. Hooghoudt (1937), who knew indirectly of Colding’s result through the work of others, was proba- adjusted it to make it more suitable for drainage with pipes. A detailed history of the equation and its more recent derivatives has been presented by VanderPloeg al. Steady flow between two parallel channels without precipitation Inthisproblem,asshowninFigure10.18,theflowintheunconfinedaquiferisdescribed by the one-dimensional Laplace equation 0 (10.39) The boundary conditions are groundwater outflow and base flow where and are the depths in the two channels. Integrating (10.39) once, one where is an integration constant. Comparison with Equation (10.27) for a horizontal = −q/k = (ηq bed shows immediately that , in which ). The variable is the rate of flow in the aquifer between the two channels per unit length of channel Becausetheflowissteady,inthepresentsituationq isaconstant,thatis,independentofx. A second integration, with the first of (10.40), yields the position of the free surface η2 = − + Application of the second of (10.40) yields the rate of flow between the two channels, in terms of the hydraulic conductivity and the known water levels in the two channels, or (cid:12) (cid:13) Again, the negative sign in Equation (10.43) merely indicates that the flow is taking place in the minus direction. Equation (10.43) is known as the Dupuit formula (see also Dupuit, 1863, p. 236). This result is of considerable theoretical interest, because it can be shown to be exact. In other words, even though in the derivation of (10.43) use is made of the hydraulic assumptions, it has the same form as the solution for the same free surface problem, obtained when no use is made of the hydraulic assumptions. The fact that, in some cases, it produces the exact result, suggests that the hydraulic approach can be a powerful and reliable tool in the derivation of the groundwater flow rates. This has been confirmed in other instances as well. However, it is now also known thatthehydraulicapproachisnotasaccurateinthepredictionofthegeometryofthefree surface. One obvious reason for this is that an inherently two-dimensional flow pattern is being described by a one-dimensional formulation. This precludes then, for example, the inclusion of a seepage surface in the boundary conditions, as was done in the second of (10.13). In hydraulic groundwater theory, there is no way to include the existence of a seepage surface and the first two of (10.13) must of necessity be combined into one Exactness of the Dupuit formula The proof proceeds as follows, for the situation sketched in Figure 10.18. Without consid- eration of the hydraulic approximation, the rate of flow through a vertical section at any point between the two open channels is given by Recall that and application of Leibniz’s formula (see Appendix, Equation (A2)) therefore allows (10.44) to be rewritten as hydraulic groundwater theory Since defines the free surface, (10.45) can be integrated to yield The constant C can be determined by applying the boundary condition at 0, where for 0 and for (The lower part of this boundary h D z D h z D z c1 c1 c1 conditiondescribesthehydrostaticconditionsandconstanthydraulicheadinthecanal,and the higher part the seepage surface; thus this condition differs from the first of (10.40), i.e. thecorrespondingconditionofthehydraulicapproach,whichisincapableofincorporating a seepage surface.) After breaking up the integral in Equation (10.46) over the two parts of its range, one obtains (cid:8) (cid:8) = −k −k +k D dz zdz 0 c1 0 0 in which is the value of at 0, or finally upon integration C (10.48) Application of the second boundary condition, namely at B, where over 0 c2 0 0 immediately. This confirms that, even though the Dupuit formula was originally obtained by means of the hydraulic approximation, it is in fact identical to the result obtainable with a more rigorous derivation. This fact should instill some confidence in the more general applicabilityofthehydraulicapproach,asaverycloseapproximationtodescribeflowrates in other situations as well. TheexactderivationoftheDupuitformulawasprobablyfirstpresentedbyI.A.Charnii, anditcanalsobefoundinthebookbyPolubarinova-Kochina(1952,p.281).Laterasimilar proof was presented by Hantush (1962; 1963)."}
{"text": "10.3.3 Unsteady flow described with standard hydraulic theory Itisagaininstructivetoconsiderthephenomenonofoutflowfromanunconfinedaquifer on a horizontal bed into a stream. This situation is still like the one described schemat- ically in Figure 10.11; however, because now the hydraulic approximation is made use of, the two-dimensional problem has been reduced to a one-dimensional problem, and the z-coordinate is no longer part of the formulation. Basic formulation This flow problem was shown to be subject to boundary conditions (10.2) and (10.3) or, after a first approximation, to (10.13); when these conditions are translated to the groundwater outflow and base flow hydraulic approach with a horizontal aquifer, they become = = ≥ (10.50) η = ≤ ≤ = The governing equation of this one-dimensional horizontal flow is the Boussinesq equa- tion(10.30).However,eveninthissimpleform,theequationisstillnonlinear;thismeans that, in contrast to linear problems, there are no general solutions available, and that a specific ad hoc method must be devised for each new problem.

These solutions are treated in the next two sections. Outflow rate η = η(x,t), Once the solution of this problem has been obtained as the outflow rate from the aquifer into the stream at 0 can be determined by applying the hydraulic form of Darcy’s equation (10.27), as follows (cid:9) (cid:10) Recallthatinthischapterq denotesthevolumeofwaterperunittimeandperunitlength of channel (i.e. per unit span or per unit width of aquifer normal to the main direction [L2T−1]. of the flow in the aquifer), so that its dimensions are In some cases it is more convenient to follow a procedure, analogous with that used to obtain Equation (9.15) forinfiltration.Accordingly,assketchedinFigure10.19,fromcontinuityconsiderations the cumulative outflow volume per unit span (with dimensions from the aquifer at 0 can be written in general as ∀ =n xdη = d∀/dt. which produces the outflow rate as Both (10.51) and (10.52) are used in the remainder of this chapter. The second approach to obtain the outflow is especially useful, whenever the method of solution is based on Boltzmann’s transform, as was the case for sorption and infiltration in Chapter 9."}

(see Figure 10.20). If initially the aquifer is fully saturated, it can be assumed that as the outflow starts the flow condition at 0 is not “felt” further away from the channel, and that the flow proceeds as if the aquifer is infinitely wide. Subsequently, however, as drainage continues, the effect of this condition diffuses, not unlike a wave, away from 0, and as it approaches B, the short time solution gradually becomes invalid. Theboundaryconditions,describingflowfromsuchaninfinitelywide,initiallysaturated aquifer into an empty channel, can be formulated as Similarity considerations Like in the sorption problem in Section 9.2, the nature of the semi-infinite flow domain and these boundary conditions imply a certain symmetry; because the aquifer must be empty after a very long time of drainage, the water level for is the same as at 0 for all times; similarly, very far from the channel, i.e. for the water will not “feel” the effect of the drainage and will remain at the original level it had at 0. groundwater outflow and base flow Hence, Boltzmann’s transform, i.e. can be used here as well. As will be shown next, this greatly simplifies the solution. In the manner shown in Equations (9.12), the Boltzmann transformation (10.54) allows the reduction of the Boussinesq equation (10.30) to the following ordinary differential equation (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 (10.55) dφ dφ dφ The boundary conditions (10.53) now become η = φ → ∞ Regardless of the method used, the solution of (10.55) with (10.56) is of the form The cumulative outflow volume from the aquifer at 0 is φ = φ(η) given by Equation (10.52). Thus, once the solution is known, in light of the Boltzmann transform, this outflow volume becomes ∀ =t φ(η)dη Because the integral in (10.57) is a constant, for conciseness of notation, the outflow volume can be expressed in terms of the hydraulic desorptivity, defined as = φ(η)dη The rate of outflow from the aquifer at 0, that is can now be written This can probably serve as a more tangible and practical definition of the desorptivity than (10.58). Note that the outflow rate can also be obtained by applying the hydraulic η = η(x,t), solution the result should be the same as that obtained with (10.59) and (10.58). Before any solutions are discussed in detail, some interesting features of the hydraulic desorptivity canbederivedfromadditionalsimilarityconsiderations.Itstandstoreason that the water table height should be normalized with its initial value D; insertion of this normalized depth into Equation (10.55) reveals then immediately the dimensionless form of Thus the problem can be cast in terms of the following scaled variables η = (η/D) hydraulic groundwater theory In terms of these dimensionless variables, the desorptivity (10.58) can now be written as a(k (10.61) In Equation (10.61) represents the definite integral which is a dimensionless constant, and thus simply a number whose value depends on the solution. To summarize, this brief analysis has shown how, except for a constant a, the exact obtainedbyusingsimilarity,thatisalmostbyinspection,withoutactuallyderivingthesolu- tion. Two types of similarity were invoked here. The first, Boltzmann’s transform, which results from the nature of the boundary conditions, involves a combination of the indepen- dent variables; it states that the dependency of on is similar to its dependency on The second type of similarity involves the scaling of the variables to make the formulation dimensionless, and thus universally applicable to any aquifer, with any dimensions and consisting of any type of porous material. Solutions Several solutions of this problem have been derived. Polubarinova-Kochina (1952, p. 507) wasabletoobtainasolution,bytransformingBoussinesq’sEquation(10.30)totheBlasius equation for the viscous boundary layer. From her result it can be shown that = 0.66412 but the details of the derivation are beyond the present scope. A similar but slightly more accurate procedure was later used by Hogarth and Parlange (1999). There are also several approximate solutions available, that while less accurate, still yield values of close to (10.63). One such solution, based on an approximation of Equation (10.30) by successive steady states, was proposed in 1886 by K. E. Lembke (cited by Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952,p.573);thisassumptioncanbeshowntoleadtoa Equation(10.63).Incidentally,theassumptionofsuccessivesteadystatesisequivalentwith thequasi-steadyapproach,whichwasusedinthesolutionofthehorizontalinfiltrationprob- lem by Parlange (1971). A second approximate solution can be obtained by linearization; in1947J.H.Edelman(citedbyKraijenhoff,1966)proposeditsusetodescribefreesurface (4p/π)1/2, groundwater flow; this solution yields a in which is a parameter used to compensate for the approximation due to the linearization and discussed further in Section 10.4. Comparison with Equation (10.63) shows that the linear solution can produce the same result as the exact outflow rate, provided 0.3465. Outflow rate The rate of outflow from the aquifer into the adjacent stream or some other type of open water body is the main item of interest in catchment hydrology; on the basis of simple similarity, it was already shown to be given by Equation (10.59), in which was defined as a constant but unspecified hydraulic desorptivity.

This water table shape is not arbitrary, but it results from the solution. As illustrated in Figure 10.21, that solution produces a water table that is curvilinear throughout the drainage process, from the beginning at 0 to the end when the outflow finally ceases. Normally, an initially saturated aquifer (cf. the third of (10.50)) will exhibit this kind of shape only after drainage has proceeded for some time; it is for this reason that the solution obtained in what follows is referred to as a long-time solution. Similarity considerations As was the case for the short-time solution, useful insight can be gained by making the formulation dimensionless. Again, it is reasonable to normalize the length variables hydraulic groundwater theory and with their respective maximal values and B, as suggested by the boundary conditions (10.65). Insertion of these normalized variables in the governing differential equation (10.30) yields then the appropriate scaling of the time variable. Thus one ends up with the following scaled variables These dimensionless variables allow the Boussinesq equation (10.30) to be simplified as (cid:2) (cid:3) and the boundary conditions (10.65) as = = ≥ (10.68) This problem can be solved by separation of variables, that is, by assuming that the η = η ,t+) solution +(x+ is a product of two functions, one dependent only on and one dependent only on t+, or Substitution of (10.69) into (10.67) produces (cid:2) (cid:3) dt+ F dx+ dx+ in which must be constant; since and are independent of each other, the and C x t F F dependent parts of Equation (10.70) can only be equal to each other if they are constant. The solution of the differential equation for cannot be expressed in terms of common functions,butforthepurposeofthepresentdiscussionitisnotneeded,soletitbeassumed that it is known; it will be derived below. However, the solution of the differential equation for yields immediately 2 1 2 1 2 can write the solution (10.69) in the following form where is a dimensionless constant, and F(x+) is a function of that satisfies the same F(cid:7) differentialequationas (x+)andtheconditions 0for 0,and 0 and 1 F F x+ F forx+ 1,accordingtotheboundaryconditions(10.68).Thissolutionindicatessimilarity, in that the initial shape of the water table is preserved throughout. In other words, once the groundwater outflow and base flow watertablehasacertainshape,itkeepsthatshape;theheightofthewatertableonlybecomes lower with time. The outflow rate from the aquifer, Equation (10.51), can be written in terms of the dimensionless variables defined in (10.66) as (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) D2/B),definingadimen- Observethatthissuggeststhattheoutflowratebescaledwith(k sionless outflow rate With the solution (10.72) and putting (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) one obtains in dimensionless form (1+at+)2 In (10.76) and are dimensionless constants, whose values depend on the solution of (10.70) for F(x+). Again, as in the previous section, this brief derivation shows how, save for these two constants,itispossibletoobtaintheexactformoftheoutflowrate,withoutactuallysolving for F(x+), and mainly on the basis of two types of similarity considerations. The first type involves self-preservation of the shape of the water table; this follows from the fact that the solution can be obtained by separation of variables. The second type involves dimensional analysis to scale the variables. Solution Asmentioned,Boussinesq(1904)presentedtheexactsolutiontothisproblem.Thissolution isgreatlysimplifiedbytheuseofthescaledvariablesanditproceedsasfollows.Thefunction With the transformations given below Equation (10.71) this requires the solution of the following ordinary differential equation (F2/2) = −aF Putting (10.77) pdp/d(F2/2). can be written as A first integration of this result yields where is a third constant of integration. Performing a second integration one obtains from (10.78) hydraulic groundwater theory in which use has been made of the first of the boundary conditions (10.68), namely 0 at 0. The two constants and will be determined next by imposing the remaining twoboundaryconditions(10.68).Impositionofthesecondof(10.68)requiresthederivative 1 (10.80) = dF/dx+ At 1 the derivative must equal zero, according to the second of (10.68); moreover, in light of (10.72) at 1 the function must be equal to one, according to one obtains (cid:2) (cid:3) y3)−1/2dy 1 (10.81) By putting it is easy to show that the integral in Equation (10.81) is equal to where the B( ) symbol denotes the complete beta function; hence (10.81) yields the following expression for the constant The value of this beta function can be readily calculated by expressing it in terms of gamma func- of these values of the constants and into Equation (10.79) yields the x+-dependent part of the solution as y3)−1/2dy B(2/3,1/2) or, in a slightly different form, B(2/3,1/2) In the form of Equation (10.83) the solution is an incomplete beta function for the variable F3.Numericalvaluesofthissolutionfor F(x+)havebeenpresentedbyAravinandNumerov (1953); they also indicated that in 1934 L.

{"text": "10.4 LINEARIZED HYDRAULIC GROUNDWATER THEORY: A THIRD APPROXIMATION A major disadvantage of all formulations to describe unconfined groundwater flows, discussed so far in this chapter, is that they are nonlinear. Even the simplest, those based on the hydraulic approach, still suffer from this, and there is no general methodology available for their solution. It is understandable, therefore, that attempts have been made in the past to remedy this by linearization. Because the solution to a linear problem can be represented as a unit response function, it can be generalized and extended to many different boundary and initial conditions by simple superposition. Moreover, once obtained, such unit response functions can provide a direct link between the main underlying physical mechanisms captured by the Boussinesq equation, and the more abstractmathematicalaspectsofgenerallinearsystems(i.e.unithydrograph)approaches at the catchment scale (see Chapter 12)."}
{"text": "10.4.1 General formulation The common way to linearize the Boussinesq equation, in the case of its simplest form, Equation (10.30), is to expand the second derivative on the right-hand side as follows ∂η ∂η ∂2η ∂t ∂x ∂x2 linearized hydraulic groundwater theory The basic assumption in the linearization is that position of the free surface is never very different from an unperturbed average value, say . Thus, because remains close to constant, in (10.87) the first term on the right becomes negligible, and in the second term can be replaced by . Equation (10.87) then becomes ∂η η ∂2η Equation (10.88) is in the form of the standard diffusion equation, with a constant hydraulic (groundwater) diffusivity In a similar way, the more general form (Equation (10.31)) of the Boussinesq equation can be linearized to produce (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂η η ∂2η ∂2η sinα ∂η = cosα + + + ∂t ∂x2 ∂y2 ∂x in which, as before, is the slope of the underlying impermeable bed. A second but less common way of linearizing the Boussinesq equation consists of multiplying both sides by and then bringing it inside the first derivatives or replacing it by , whichever appears more appropriate. For instance, in the case of Equation (10.30) this yields ∂η2 η ∂2η2 which is linear in This approach was probably first used by N. A. Bagrov and later by N. N. Verigin (Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952; Aravin and Numerov, 1953).

Nevertheless, two known solutions for specialsituationsmaygivesomeindication.Oneoccurswhen and intheboundary conditions (10.50) have nearly the same value.

{"text": "10.4.2 Flow from a horizontal aquifer Consider again the standard case of outflow from an initially saturated aquifer, after the cessation of rainfall or recharge, as described by boundary conditions (10.50). In the linearized system the governing differential equation is now (10.88). Similarity considerations As before in (10.66), it is convenient to scale the variables. The form of (10.88) and of (10.50) suggest that this be done as follows These scaled variables allow the differential equation (10.88) to be written as Similarly, the boundary conditions (10.50) can be expressed in terms of the scaled variables as follows = = ≥ (10.96) η = ≤ ≤ = linearized hydraulic groundwater theory Solution Separation of variables in the form of a product solution like (10.69), and substitution in (10.95) produce in this case where is a constant for the same reason as in (10.70), which is positive because and must always remain finite; this can be seen from the solution for the t+-dependent part of (10.97), that is = exp(−C t+) (10.98) The solution of the differential equation for in (10.97) produces (cid:18) (cid:18) 1 3 1 4 1 where and are constants.

It was probably not until the work of Dumm (1954) and Kraijenhoff (1958) that the full series was used in hydrology. increase rapidly as 1, 9, 25, . . . Moreover, the amplitudes of the sine functions in the series 1/3, 1/5, decrease as 1, . . . These are the two features which made Boussinesq observe, that with time only the first term in the series survives. Thus the water table (10.105) gradually assumes the shape of the first sine function, and the long-time linear solution is the fundamental harmonic (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:6) πx+ −π2t+ sin exp (10.107) linearized hydraulic groundwater theory Comparison between the first and second term in the series of (10.105) shows that this long-time solution can be assumed to be valid when where the error drops well below 1%.

This result is illustrated in Figure 10.23. In terms of the original variables, after trans- formation with (10.94), the rate of outflow from the unconfined aquifer (10.112) can be written as (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n − 1)2π2k η = −2k η − (D )B exp (10.113) n=1,2,... Asalreadynoted,eventuallywithincreasingtimeonlythefirsttermoftheseriesremains, = 2,3,... as the terms in become negligible.

Indeed, as pointed out by Kraijenhoff (1958), it represents in fact the unit response, that is the Green’s function for the linear hydraulic aquifer. The unit input applied over the whole aquifer (in two dimensions, that is per unit length of stream channel or per unit span), causing this response, is [n (D per unit area of − )]δ(t). ground surface this is [n (D Therefore, the response of a linearized hydraulic aquifer to a delta function input, that is the unit response, from (10.113), is (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2k η (n exp (10.117) n=1,2,... Arbitrary inputs into the aquifer by precipitation, snowmelt, etc., or negative inputs by evaporation at the surface, leakage through the impermeable bed, etc., can be dealt with by simple convolution (see Appendix). Thus if this input per unit horizontal area is I(t), with dimensions applied uniformly over the aquifer, i.e. independently of x, the resulting outflow rate at 0 is (10.118) where u(t) is given by (10.117) and is the memory inherent or assigned to the flow system. It should be noted that in a similar way, on account of the assumed linearity of the system, the solution for the position of the water table, namely (10.106), can in principle alsoserveasthebasisforaunitresponsefunctionresultingfromadeltafunctioninput;this linearized hydraulic groundwater theory can then be used to predict the evolution of the water table resulting from arbitrary inputs (e.g. steady rainfall as in the following example) by convolution, i.e. with the analog of (10.118)appliedtoη insteadofq.However,asnotedearlier,thepositionofthewatertable in hydraulic groundwater theory is quite unreliable, and need therefore not be of further concern here. Example 10.2 The application of (10.118) can be readily illustrated by considering the case of a constant inputofunitintensity I(t) .Theresultingoutflowratebecomessteadywhenthisinput has been applied for a very long time.

Example 10.3 The next case to be considered is the outflow rate some time after a steady input has ceased. This represents the outflow rate from the aquifer, with the initial shape of the water tablegivenby(10.37)resultingfromasteadyinfiltration,ratherthanbythethirdof(10.50) describing fully saturated conditions. This case is of practical interest, as the steady input mayrepresentprolongedrainfallorirrigation.Indeed,theonsetofdrainageafterprolonged rainfall or irrigation, which does not fully saturate the aquifer, is a common occurrence in humid regions. If 0 is the time when the steady input stops, the input I(t) can be formulated as follows = −∞ < < (10.122) Thus (10.118) can be written as (cid:8) (cid:8) u(t 0 u(t (10.123) groundwater outflow and base flow Scaledoutflowhydrographq+ q+(t+)from Fig.10.24 alinearizedhydraulicaquiferintoan adjoiningopenwaterbody(heavyline)as givenby(10.126),andthefirstterminthe seriesexpansion(thinstraightline).Herethe outflowrateisscaledwiththeinitialoutflow rateq BIc;thisinitialoutflowrateresults Ic priortot+ fromasteadyinput 0,as describedinExample10.3. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Thesecondtermontherightyieldszero;therefore,uponintegrationofthefirsttermonthe right of (10.123) with (10.117), one can write c 0 0 0 0 (2n 4n 4n (10.124) or, finally, after application of the limits of integration, (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2k η exp (10.125) At 0, when the steady input ceases, this solution yields the initial condition (10.121), as it should. A feature worth noting in (10.125) is that it converges much more quickly to the first term in the series than (10.113), on which the unit response (10.117) is based. This rapid disappearance of the higher-order terms in (10.125) is best illustrated by expressing it in dimensionless form. By scaling the outflow rate with the initial flow rate, so that in the present case ), (10.125) becomes (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2t+ exp (10.126) be seen that only the first term survives, when this is in contrast with (10.112), illustrated in Figure 10.23 where the same can be seen to occur only for The difference between these two cases stems from the different initial condition. For (10.112) the aquifer is assumed to be initially fully saturated, whereas for (10.126), the water table is initially assumed to be described by the linearized version of (10.35). Example 10.4 Consider now the outflow resulting from rainfall as an arbitrary input function of time P(t).Inprinciplethereshouldbenoproblemincarryingouttheconvolutionintegration, linearized hydraulic groundwater theory analytically or numerically. However, rainfall data are usually recorded as bar graphs, that is as constant values over finite time intervals, hourly or daily.

{"text": "10.4.3 Flow from a hillslope aquifer Again, to derive the unit response function, it is convenient to consider the problem of outflow from an initially saturated aquifer (Figure 10.26). While the aquifer empties out, there is no surface recharge, so that the differential equation governing this phenomenon is (10.90) with 0. In the case of a sloping aquifer, the total flow rate at any distance from the channel can be determined from (10.26); after linearization, this is (cid:2) (cid:3) η) = −k η cosα + sinαη (q (10.132) Therefore, the boundary condition at the divide, where , is not simply the second of (10.50), but it must be adjusted to simulate the impermeable barrier in accordance linearized hydraulic groundwater theory with (10.132). Moreover, in hilly terrain, torrential streams tend to be shallow, and they usually have no effect on the groundwater flow in the adjoining hillslopes, so that it is safe to assume that 0.

Equations (5.88) and (5.92)). In the present case of a sloping aquifer the hydraulic diffusivity is not simply (10.89), but it contains the slope effect, or (10.135) In addition (10.134) contains a hydraulic (groundwater) advectivity (10.136) By analogy with flood wave propagation in open channels, a disturbance of the water table height in a sloping aquifer can be visualized as undergoing two types of changes. The first is a deformation of its shape, which is governed by the diffusivity (10.135); the second is a displacement of this disturbance down the slope, whose rate of propagation is given by the advectivity (10.136).

For large values of Hi the diffusion term, i.e. the first term on the right of Equation (10.138), is negligible, and the kinematic flow approximation (see Section 10.5) is valid. For small values of Hi (i.e. a small slope and/or a relatively deep aquifer with large )) the problem can be treated as one of horizontal flow, and the solution can be approximated by (10.106).

AswillbediscussedfurtherinSection10.5,kinematicmotionispurelytranslatorywithout change in shape of the water table. In the present case described by Equation (10.138), in the early stages, while all the higher order terms in the series solution are still active, diffusion causes the water table near the outlet to spread out, a behavior not unlike that of flood waves in open channels, discussed in Chapter 7; but later on, as the kinematic effect groundwater outflow and base flow takesover,thebulkofthewaterleftintheaquifertendstomovedownmoreasatranslatory wave, causing the appearance of a “pause” in the hydrograph during the transition between the two regimes. The occurrence of this pause is related to the time when the height of the water table approaches zero at the divide, where 1. The rate at which the water tableheightapproacheszeroatthedivide,likethestrengthofthepauseillustratedinFigure 10.27,dependsmainlyonthemagnitudeofthehillslopeflownumberHi.Actually,itcanbe seen that Equation (10.141) predicts that at the divide can never become zero, and that with time it can only approach it exponentially. This is somewhat counterintuitive, because the hydraulic groundwater approach is based on the assumption that the water table is a true free surface and thus a sharp interface; therefore physically, there is no reason why η ,t+)wouldnotbeabletobecome0at = suchasharpinterface +(x+ 1,anditwouldbe expected that after this occurs, the point of 0 would slide down along the bottom of the aquifer from 1 in the direction of 0. Originally, the fact that (10.141) does not predict such a sequence of events was thought to be caused by the shortcomings of the hydraulic approach with the Boussinesq equation; it was recently (Stagnitti al., 2004) shown, however, that this is not the case, and that it is in fact the result of the linearization of that equation. This should not be surprising, as it is well known that solutions of the linear diffusion equation usually do not exhibit sharp fronts, but rather long exponential tails; other examples of this or similar features can be found in applications of the linear diffusion equation in open channel flow (Equation (5.95) and Figure 5.9) and in infiltration Equation (10.141) to allow the water table height 0 to move down along the bottom oftheaquiferpastx+ 1,maynotbeacrucialissueinhillslopehydrology.Inrealaquifers, the falling water table is not a sharp drying front, and the flow is more closely described by theRichardsequation,thanbytheBoussinesqequation.Thismeansthatthesolutionofthe linearized formulation, viz. Equation (10.141), with its asymptotic approach to zero, may not necessarily provide a worse approximation than the sharp interface description. Still, regardless of these shortcomings, the analysis of the linearized problem shows how with increasing Hi, the diffusive aspects of the phenomenon gradually become less important, and perhaps even irrelevant in the description of hillslope flows in actual catchments; this suggests that for large values of Hi, say in excess of 10, it may be preferable to use the considerably simpler kinematic approach outlined below in Section 10.5. The short time limit of Equation (10.143) can be shown (Brutsaert, 1994) to be simply cosα/π)1/2 Dt−1/2 (10.144) cosα/(πD)]1/2 (10.145) Actually, Equation (10.144) is the exact solution of (10.138) without the second term on the right, subject to (10.133), in which and sin 0. This means that after a sudden cessation of the water supply (e.g. from rainfall) at the soil surface, the outflow proceeds initially as a diffusion phenomenon in an infinitely long aquifer. This is not unex- pected. Recall that a similar type of behavior with initial dependency occurs in other phenomena described by the advection diffusion equation as well; one example, covered in Chapter 9, is vertical infiltration of ponded water into a dry soil profile. Note also, that Equation (10.144) with (10.145) for 0 is the solution for drainage from an infinitely long horizontal aquifer proposed by Edelman (cited by Kraijenhoff, 1966). linearized hydraulic groundwater theory Unit response and response to an arbitrary input Equation(10.143)representstheoutflowratefollowingcompletesaturationofthehillslope aquifer.

For large values of the slope, and thus of the hillslope flow number Hi, the effect of advection overwhelms the diffusion. This can also be seen in Equations (10.134) and (10.138). In the kinematic wave approach, Hi is assumed to be sufficiently large that the pressure gradient term, leading to the diffusive term, can be simply neglected; thus the hydraulic gradient in (10.128) is assumed to be equal to the bed slope sin and (10.29) reduces to a first-order linear equation, as follows ∂η sinα ∂η (10.150) This approach was briefly introduced by Boussinesq (1877) for steep slopes; in the simple case of outflow without recharge I, he pointed out that, because (10.150) is in the form of a total derivative dη ∂η ∂η = + = 0, a water table height travels down the slope at a speed (10.151) Conversely, to an imaginary observer traveling down the slope at a speed given by Equation (10.151), it would appear that the height of the water table does not change withtime.Thisresultisnotunexpected,anditisanalogouswithopenchannelflow,inthat the advectivity of the diffusion equation (10.136) and the celerity of the kinematic wave (10.151)areidentical,orc .Incontrasttothekinematicwaveinopenchannelflow, Boussinesq’sresult(10.151)hasthefollowingtwofeatures.First,itcanbeseenthatc is independent of This means that all values of travel at the same speed, and the water table maintains its original shape as it moves downhill. For example, a rectangular input pulse of precipitation, which enters the aquifer instantaneously at the soil surface, will flow out from the aquifer into the stream channel as a time-delayed rectangular output pulse.Second,itcouldbearguedthatEquation(10.151)doesnotreallydescribeawave; groundwater outflow and base flow indeed, to the extent that the drainable porosity represents the mobile water in the soil (so that ) can be considered immobile water as indicated in Figure 10.12), Equation (10.151) is also the true velocity of the water in the aquifer. Therefore, it is perhaps preferable to refer to this phenomenon as kinematic flow, rather than kinematic wave. It can be seen that the reason for this equality of fluid and wave velocity is the inherent linearity of (10.150). On the other hand, it should also be remembered that, in spite of its name, the real physical significance of is not obvious; it was introduced as a mere parameter to compensate for the neglect of the partly saturated flow above the water table in the soil by the free surface approximation. While the fraction of the soil volume below the water table occupied by flowing water is not as large as the total porosity , it is probably larger than , because not all the flowing water is removed by the drainage process. Therefore, the true velocity of the water in the aquifer is not likely to be as large as (10.151). This means that it can be expected that the water table motion down a steep slope may still have certain features of a wave; but on account of the obscure physical nature of , these features are unclear and the phenomenon will require further study. The applicability of the kinematic wave approach was studied by Henderson and Wooding(1964),bycomparingtheirresultspresentedinSection6.2.2appliedtoground- water, i.e. for the case 0, with those obtainable with the full Boussinesq equation. They concluded that the differences can be significant for the decay phase, as obtain- able, for example, from the groundwater analog of Equation (6.27). As mentioned, in the kinematic approach the hydraulic gradient is assumed to be equal to the bed slope; in practice, this is usually taken to be the same as the ground surface slope. The main practical drawback of this approach is that it is unsuitable when a wide range of slopes has to be considered, including very small ones in relatively flat terrain. However, for steep slopes or large values of the hillslope flow number Hi this approach can be a useful tool to describe the flow.

{"text": "10.6.1 General features Base flow is the discharge rate in a river that results from the natural release of the water stored in the upstream river channels and adjoining riparian aquifers in the absence of precipitation, snowmelt, or other inputs. In general, this type of flow depends primarily on the physiographic characteristics of the basin, on the distribution of water storage in river channels and in groundwater aquifers, and possibly also on the evaporation from the basin. These physiographic characteristics are mainly the geomorphology of the landscape and of the stream network, and the configuration and nature of the riparian aquifers and near-surface soils; these characteristics reflect the geology and the climate catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Fig.10.29 Schematicplanviewofafirst-ordercatchmentillustratingtheintegrationofthelocaloutflowrates fromtheriparianunconfinedaquiferstoderivethetotaloutflowfromtheareaaccordingtoEquation denotesthelinealcoordinatealongtheriver; thebreadthsoftheaquifersontheleftandrightbanks,respectively;thedashedlinesindicatethe heightcontourlinesofthelandsurface. of the basin, which can be considered as time invariant at the usual time scales of the major components of the hydrologic cycle. The effect of the channel storage under base flow conditions is normally quite small. Indeed, the water stored in river channels is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than that stored in active groundwater aquifers (see also Table 1.3). Moreover, typical travel times of water in a river tend to be orders of magnitude smaller than those in the adjoining groundwater aquifers. Under certain conditions, groundwater evaporation can have a seasonal effect; however, because groundwater evaporation can take place only from limited areas, usually near theriverbanks,wherethewatertablesarecloseenoughtothesurface,thiseffectisoften negligible (see Zecharias and Brutsaert, 1988b). From these considerations, it is apparent that the base flow at any point in the river, Q(t), is mainly the result of groundwater drainage; thus it can usually be assumed to represent the instantaneous integral of all upstream local groundwater out- flows, taken along the river channels all the way to the headwaters. With this assumption the flow rate in a river at the outlet of a catchment under base flow conditions can be formulated as Q(t) (10.152) wheres istheupstreamlinealcoordinatealongallriverchannelsinthebasin, isthetotal length of these channels, and and the groundwater inflows from the left and the right bank, respectively (see Figure 10.29). Since the physiography ofthebasindoesnotchangewithtime,thelocalgroundwateroutflowratesq and are likelytobeuniqueandtime-invariantfunctionsofthelocalgroundwaterstorage.Because and depend on the coordinate s, Equation (10.152) indicates that the basin-scale base flow Q(t) depends not only on the total water storage in the basin, but also on the areal distribution of that storage over the basin. However, the storage distribution does not always remain the same and it evolves, usually as a direct result of the spatial groundwater outflow and base flow distribution of the antecedent precipitation. This means that Q(t) need not be a unique function of time. Over smaller catchments, when the precipitation can be assumed to be sufficiently uniform, this may not be a problem. However, for larger basins it is not easy to define a unique base flow function from experimental data. This difficulty of non- uniqueness is aggravated by the fact that also the time reference, that is 0, is almost impossible to define. Indeed, in the case of a long-term streamflow record with base flow episodically interrupted by stormflow events resulting from precipitation, it is not a simple matter to identify the start of each base flow episode. In the past, this difficulty of non-uniqueness and uncertainty in time origin has been avoided mainly in two ways, namely by assuming that the low-flow recession hydrograph can be represented as an exponential decay or some other a priori adopted function, or by casting the recession hydrograph in differential form."}
{"text": "10.6.2 Average base flow recession as an exponential decay process Whenever the time dependence of the flow rate in a river can be assumed to be an exponential decay process, this can be written in the following form = exp(−t/K) (10.153) where is the flow rate at 0, and is a constant, representing a characteristic storage delay in the watershed; both can be considered as parameters to be determined from observations. An important feature of Equation (10.153), and the main reason for its wide usage in practice is that, if (10.153) truly describes the flow, the value of K, as determined by regression or other techniques, should be totally insensitive to the choice of the time reference, 0. This means that in a semi-logarithmic plot of versus t, it should be possible to identify a base flow recession graphically, as the (straight) lower envelopeofanumberoftailendsectionsoflowflowrecessionhydrographs,aftershifting them horizontally until the best coincidence is obtained; the value of is obtained from the slope of that envelope. Early representations of base flow by an exponential decay function have been the total recession hydrograph in a stream channel was assumed to be the sum of three exponential decay functions, namely the contribution by surface runoff, the contribu- tion by interflow, and the contribution by the groundwater outflow from the watershed; eventually, after surface runoff and interflow are depleted, the recession consists only of ground water drainage. Some other examples of the wide practical application of Equation (10.153) in characterizing base flows can be found in the studies by Laurenson term of (10.143), that is the first harmonic of the solution of the linearized Boussinesq equation. It is, of course, also the response of a lumped linear storage element, as used in the hydrologic systems approach (see Section 12.2.2). The fact that (10.153) has the same exponential form as these physically based expressions of Section 10.4 provides a strong indication that the storage delay constant can be expected to depend on the soil catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Dailydischargedatainm3s−1measured Fig.10.30 duringstreamflowrecessionsoverafive-year periodonFallCreek,nearIthaca,NY.Therate offlowontheithdayisplottedagainsttherate offlowonthe(i+1)thday.Theareaofthis catchmentis326km2. 0 10 20 30 properties and , the thickness and the breadth of the riparian aquifers, their slopes and possibly other basin characteristics.

The applicability of (10.153) or (10.154), that is the linearity of the basin for base flow, can be checked graphically by plotting versus for available recession flow data. An example of such data is shown in Figure 10.30. The upper envelope of these points describes the fastest rate of decrease in flow rate on record; it can therefore be assumed to be caused by the depletion of channel storage during a storm flow event and, as will be discussed below, depletion of the steeper hill slopes in the basin. On the other hand, the lower envelope, which describes the slowest rate of decrease on record, can be assumed to represent base flow recession, due to the depletion of groundwater storage in the riparian aquifers. If the base flow recession is truly linear and given by Equation (10.154), must be constant; because is the slope of the lower envelope, it should be a straight line. In the example shown in Figure 10.30, the points do not quite have a straight line lower envelope, and therefore for this basin the possibility of a nonlinear base flow regime cannot be excluded. This procedure of plotting versus groundwater outflow and base flow withtheupperenvelopewasprobablyintroducedbyLangbein(1938),whoapplied ittocharacterizechannelstoragerecession.ItwaslaterextendedbyLinsleyetal.(1958) to characterize also the base flow recession by using the lower envelope."}
{"text": "10.6.3 Base flow decline rate: recession slope analysis Under conditions when freezing, thawing and snowmelt do not play a role, long-term streamflow records normally consist of base flow episodes that alternate with episodes of storm flow resulting from precipitation. In general, except when it is an exponential function of time, the functional form of the base flow obtained from streamflow data is sensitive to the choice or definition of 0, that is the assumed start of each base flow episode. This uncertainty in the determination of a consistent time reference can be avoided by eliminating the time variable from the analysis of the data, and by taking insteaditsdifferentialdt.Thiscanbedonebyconsideringnotthehydrograph Q(t)itself, but rather its slope as a function of Q, as follows (Q) (10.155) where ( ) is a function that is characteristic for a given catchment. With actual stream- (cid:14)t flow measurements versus at successive times apart, this function can be approximated by (cid:2) (cid:3) (10.156) (cid:14)t The rate of decline of groundwater outflow is markedly slower than that of other streamflow input components, resulting from precipitation related events, such as over- land runoff or channel storage depletion. Therefore in the application of Equation (10.155) it can be assumed that base flows represent the smallest for a given |dQ/dt|). (or the largest rate of flow for a given This means that in any graphical representationof(Q dataversus(Q the function ( ) in (10.155) can be taken as the lower envelope. The main objective of such a procedure is to capture some characteristics of the ensemble of many recessions, which cannot possibly be seen or detected by analyzing individual recessions. Indeed, in a natural catchment, hydrographs and their recessions come in many different shapes and they can vary greatly from one runoff event to the next. The shape of a hydrograph depends on many factors, such as the spatial distribution of the initial soil moisture content, the spatial distribution of the water table levels, and the spatial and temporal distribution of the prior precipitation events over the catchment. This infinity in possible outcomes and the large variability and non-uniqueness of shapes is illustrated by the fact that when one plots daily values of vsQ for a natural watershed one obtains a broad cloud of points. Figure 10.31 shows an example. Thus the lower envelope is the locus of points for the slowest recession rate conversely, it represents also the largest flow rate for any given recession rate Inprinciple,thislargestflowrateistheonethatwouldbeobserved(eventhoughthismay catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Datapoints−dQ/dt Fig.10.31 plottedagainst observedduringtheperiod1961–1974onTonkawaCreekin Oklahoma,withthelowerenvelopelineswithslopes1and3,respectively,inaccordancewithEquation 67km2,thetotallengthofallstreamchannelsis (10.157).Thedrainageareaofthisbasinis =70km,andtheestimatedmeandepthofthesurfaceaquifersis =1.6m.(FromBrutsaertand Lopez,1998.) never occur) if the entire watershed were initially and uniformly saturated. In natural catchments, the exact form of the base flow function Q(t) is usually unknown, especially when the characteristics of the riparian aquifers deviate markedly from those of the idealized cases considered above in Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5. Thus, beside the avoidance of the time origin problem, the procedure based on Equations (10.155) and (10.156) also has the advantage that it will give some insight into which of the above theoretical expressions may be applicable, if at all. Unfortunately, however, because it involves derivatives, this procedure is also sensitive to unavoidable inherent errors in the data. It is therefore advisable to constrain such envelopes somewhat on the basis of available theoretical considerations, as shown next. groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.32 Simplifiedschematicrepresentationofthecatchmentshownin Figure10.29,illustratingtheuseofthe spatiallyconstanteffectiveparametersq B and todescribethecatchment-scalegroundwateroutflow Q.Thusitisassumedthat Q 2qL 2LB. rate and Application with available groundwater outflow solutions For several well-known solutions of the Boussinesq equation, describing groundwa- ter outflow from an unconfined aquifer based on the hydraulic approach, it can be function, (10.157) where and are constants. Equation (10.157) is obtainable from each of these solutions by assuming geometric similarity of the drainage pattern and the channel network within the catchment. With this assumption, and by defining an equivalent or effective lateral inflow rate into the stream, one can immediately integrate (10.152) as follows 2L (10.158) As before, is the total length of all tributary and main channel sections upstream from the gauging station where the stream flow is Q. Likewise one can define an effective aquifer breadth B, as the distance from channel to divide (see Figure 10.32) by = A/(2L) (10.159) in which is the drainage area of the catchment, and is known as the drainage density. Equation (10.159) is the same as the relationship proposed by Horton (1945) for the average overland flow distance in a catchment whose channel slope is much smaller than the land surface slopes. The first of these solutions, that can be put in the form of (10.157), is the short-time outflow rate (10.64), which was obtained by Boltzmann similarity and which exhibits the characteristic behavior. Upon substitution of (10.158), (10.64) yields the basin- scale outflow rate (cid:12) (cid:13) 0.66412 (10.160) catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Operatingonthisresultinthemannerof(10.157),oneobtainsinthiscaseforitsconstants (cid:12) (cid:13) (10.161) = −1.1336 in which the subscripts 1 indicate that it is the first solution which is considered here.

This is illustrated in Figure 10.31, in which the slope of the envelope happens to be close to one, or 1 in Equation (10.157). This has also been done by linear regression with all the data log(−dQ/dt) points of against log(Q). Neither procedure appears to be objective, and at present, it is still not clear how an appropriate a priori value of can be determined, which describes the long-time behavior of a given basin. In the catchment studies by Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) and Troch al. (1993), it was concluded that whereas in Vogel and Kroll (1992), Brutsaert and Lopez (1998) and Eng and Brutsaert (1999) it was decided to be 1. This will require further study. Once the appropriate long-time outflow expression and its value of have been decided upon, the value of and (or ) can be determined from the lower envelopes with slopes 3 and 1 (or respectively, on a log–log plot of the available vs data. Examples of the procedure are shown in Figures 10.31 and 10.33. In what follows, the determination of the basin-scale aquifer parameters is outlined for the linear case with 1; however, the analogous analysis with is straightforward, and can be left as an exercise for the reader. The value of is related to the extinction coefficient of the exponential outflow equation (10.153) by (10.171) catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Fig.10.33 SameasFigure10.31,butfortheperiod1966–1977onSaltCreekinOklahoma.Thedrainageareaof 62km2,thetotallengthofallstreamchannelsis A= =76km,andtheestimatedmean thisbasinis depthofthesurfaceaquifersis 1.4m.(FromBrutsaertandLopez,1998.)

It is also related to the hydraulic diffusivity defined in Equation (10.89). Comparison between = −a (A/L)2 (10.172) Inasimilarway,thevalueofa fortheshort-timeenvelopecanberelatedtothehydraulic desorptivity defined in Equation (10.59). In this case, comparison between (10.161) and (10.61) with (10.63) shows that (2a L) (10.173) effective aquifer parameters from (or ) and .

For example, in case the mean aquifer thickness can be assumed known (say, from soil maps or othersurveys),thehydraulicconductivityandthedrainableporositycanbeimmediately obtained by combining Equations (10.161) and (10.165), namely = 0.5757(a /a and (10.174) = 1.9688(a Analogous equations can be derived by combining (10.161) and (10.163) for the non- linear case of the long-time outflow rate. Example 10.7. Estimation of basin aquifer parameters As an illustration of the results obtainable with this approach, Figure 10.34 displays the values of derived with (10.172) from the values that were obtained in a study by Brutsaert and Lopez (1998); the study made use of streamflow data from 22 subbasinsoftheWashitaRiverwatershedinOklahoma,withvaluesof Arangingroughly between 1 and 500 and between 2 and 670 km. These values had a mean of d−1 d−1), 0.0316 (with a standard deviation of 0.0167 which amounts to a mean storage half life of roughly 22 days.

Figures 10.36 and 10.37 show the ranges of values of and , that were obtained by means of Equations (10.174) in the Washita River watershed. The values of these two parameters obtained with this method appear to lie well within the accepted ranges for field measurements in other studies. It is also not surprising that the hydraulic conduc- tivities are several orders of magnitude larger than values to be expected on the basis of laboratory measurements or by “sandbox” standards. This is because of macropores and preferential flow paths that become operative at larger spatial scales. More importantly, however,thevaluesshowninthefiguresarewithinareasonablerangefromoneanother; this suggests that the arguably oversimplified hydraulic approach and the method of slope analysis can serve a useful purpose. The same study also showed that the characteristic outflow time (a K) is well correlated with spatial scale L, that is the length of all stream channels in the basin; the obtained correlation coefficient was This is not unexpected in light of Equation (10.165), but as the drainage density does not vary widely in this region, the predictive power of the relationship between and was found to be weak. The short-timeconstanta wasfoundtobestronglyrelatedwithstreamlength L;actually,the = −5.46 × = 0.91, regression equation was calculated to be (in m) withr in good agreement with the dependency in Equation (10.161).

Among the other parameters, the hydraulic conduc- tivity was found to be only weakly (if at all) scale correlated in that range of scales of 2km). The hydraulic diffusivity , the hydraulic desorptivity , and the drain- able porosity or specific yield showed no evidence of any scale dependency in the same range of scales. The effect of mean aquifer slope From the analyses developed in this chapter it is clear that the slope of the riparian aquifers canbeexpectedtoexertastronginfluenceonthemagnitudeandevolutionofthebaseflow fromabasin.Cursoryinspectionoftheunitresponsefunctionofahillslope(10.146)withthe accompanyingFigures10.27and10.28indicatesthatHicanindeedplayamajorrole.This wasalsobroughtoutintheinvestigationofmeasureddroughtflowdatafrom19watersheds in a mountainous section of the Appalachian Plateau by Zecharias and Brutsaert (1985; 1988a); the results of a factor analysis indicated that, among the geomorphic parameters that are related to groundwater outflow, total length of perennial streams, drainage density and average basin slope are most closely related to the process. Moreover, the influences of these three parameters on groundwater outflow behavior are independent of each other; thus,theinclusionofadditionalparameterswouldnotnecessarilyyieldabetterrelationship, andmayresultinredundancy.Thisempiricalresultisconsistentwiththelinearbasin-scale indicates that L, and Hi are the only three geomorphic parameters which control the flow. For the present purpose, geomorphic parameters may be considered the ones that can be derived from topographic maps. Unfortunately, in contrast to stream length and drainage density, until now attempts to includeslopeinbasin-scaleparameterizationshavebeenlessthansuccessful.Theproblem was addressed in Zecharias and Brutsaert (1988b) in the context of the applicability of Equation (10.157) in hilly terrain. The same 19 representative catchments in the Allegheny MountainsectionoftheAppalachianPlateau,mentionedabove,wereanalyzedonthebasis of(10.157)withb 1.Theresultsshowedthata,takenastheslopeofthelowerenvelopeof in agreement with Equation (10.167), but surprisingly not on land surface slope. However, theresultsalsoshowed,thatinthesesameplotsboththeslopeoftheupperenvelopeandthe mean slope through all the data points, decrease with time. For instance, in one watershed in the region, with flow values that occurred 2, 4, 6, and 7 days following a rainfall event, the slopes of the upper envelopes were observed to evolve as 0.33, 0.23, 019, and d−1, d−1. 0.15 respectively, whereas the lower envelopes remained at around 0.063 As illustrated in Figure 10.38, a similar evolution of of the upper envelopes was observed in the Washita River Basin. Thevalueoftherateofflow ofarecedinghydrographdependsmainlyonthestorage of water in the watershed. But the upper envelope in graphical representations like Figure 10.38 provides information on the groundwater outflow regime in the early stages of a dry periodwhentheratesofrecession,i.e.−dQ/dt,arehigh.Thesuccessivevaluesofa that there are aquifers in the basin whose recession rates are initially large, but decrease sensibly as the rainless period continues. Advanced states of the outflow process, which are accompanied by small recession rates, are represented by the lower envelopes, whose values in the successive scatter diagrams remain essentially the same. It is likely that the variation of the parameter of the upper envelopes with time is largely the result of groundwater outflow and base flow Datapoints−dQ/dt Fig.10.38 plottedagainst observedoverdroughtflowepisodeswiththefirstday duringtheperiod1962–1977onWestBitterCreekwithintheWashitaRiverbasinin 154km2,thetotallengthofstreamsis Oklahoma.Thedrainageareaofthisbasinis 161km,andtheestimatedmeandepthofthesurfaceaquifersis 1.3m.(FromBrutsaert andLopez,1998.) references the nonuniform distribution of the physical characteristics within a catchment. Equation (10.167) indicates that the steeper parts of a basin, where Hi is larger, must have faster depletion rates, and therefore larger values of a; such areas are usually located near the headwater sections of a basin. In contrast the downstream regions of a basin have smaller inclinations, hence relatively lower rates of depletion. All this shows that, although the characterization of a basin as a single lumped unit with basin scale parameters is a useful paradigm, it has definite limitations. The total outflow rate is the sum of flow contributions from aquifer sections with unequal response characteristics. This total flow is initially dominated by the discharges of channel storage and of the steeper aquifers, which contribute a large fraction of the total flow during the first few hours or days of a recession period. As the recession progresses, however, these storage elements become rapidly depleted and the gentler parts of the aquifer, now being the main contributors, determine the outflow. This also means that the determination of the basin scale aquifer properties by means of an analysis of the lower envelopes is valid mainly in relatively flat and even terrain. In more rugged catchments the lower envelope tendstoreflectthepropertiesofthebroadervalleysectionsinthelowerparts.Therefore,in practical applications for design purposes in hilly watersheds, it may be advisable to adopt an average value of and in Equation (10.157), say by regression through all the data points (rather than from the lower envelope alone), to describe representative basin scale parameters. These issues will require further study. REFERENCES Handbook of Mathematical Functions, Appl. Math. 55. National Washington, DC: Bureau of Standards. Aravin, V. I. and Numerov, S. N. (1953).

{"text": "11.1 RIPARIAN AREAS AND HEADWATER BASINS The transformation of precipitation, after it hits the land surface, into streamflow gen- erally takes place over an area of land along the river channel that extends from the channel banks to the nearest divide. Thus each channel segment of a river system can be visualized as lying between two strips of riparian land on either side that feed water into it. While the mechanisms involved in the transformation from precipitation to stream flow depend on many factors, an important one to consider is the relative size of the river segment within the river and tributary system of the basin. In geomorphology, it is customary to classify stream channels in a hierarchy of orders, in which the order of a stream depends on the number of upstream trib- utaries or bifurcations. Horton (1932; 1945) was probably the first to propose a downstream-moving ordering procedure. In this system, tributaries without branches are called first-order streams; the branches that receive only first-order streams are des- ignated second-order streams, and those that receive one or more second-order and also streamflow generation Fig.11.1 Theordernumbersofriverchannelsegmentsina naturalbasindrainagenetworkaccordingtothe Horton–Strahlermethod. first-order streams are considered third-order streams, and so on. The definition of first- and second-order streams is clear and unambiguous in Horton’s procedure, but the def- inition of third- and higher-order streams required some subjective decisions. To avoid these and to ensure that only one stream would bear the highest-order number in the basin, Strahler (1952) adjusted the procedure by stipulating that third-order streams can only be formed by the joining of any two second-order segments, and so on. The Horton–Strahler method, as it is now called, is illustrated in Figure 11.1; in this exam- ple, there are 18 first-order streams, five second-order streams, and one third-order Larger-orderriverchannelsusuallydonotreceivemuchwaterlocallyfromtheriparian surfaces along their banks, but they receive most of their water from upstream through lower-order streams. The catchments that are drained by lower-order streams with no or very few tributaries can be called basins, watersheds, or also headwater source area upland watersheds. Because they feed into channels of progressively higher order, these lower-order catchments are crucial for a better understanding of runoff mechanisms in larger basins as well. An important feature for the analysis of runoff from such headwater catchments is that lower-order river channels tend to have relatively short residence times; thus any storm runoff hydrograph from a source area watershed is affected primarily by the nature of the soil mantle areas surrounding the stream and very little by the nature of the stream itself. Further downstream, however, as more and more tributaries join, the shape of the hydrograph evolves, and it will increasingly reflect the hydraulic characteristics of the channel network. The flow mechanisms in riparian areas and headwater basins, a topic often referred to also as hillslope hydrology, have been the subject of intense research in the past few decades. A knowledge of these mechanisms and of their interactions is not only essential to describe streamflow generation, but it is also the key to a better understanding of solute transport in the human environment and of the evolution of landforms and erosion. storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.2 Illustrationoftheoverlandflow (OF)mechanismasinfiltration excess.Theprecipitationrate exceedsinfiltrationcapacity,and thewatertableisattheground surface.

{"text": "11.2.1 Overland flow Infiltration excess overland flow Thistypeofflowoccurswhentherainfallrateislargerthantheinfiltrationcapacity,sothat there is an excess which runs off over the surface. Although this flow generation concept is sometimes associated with the name of Horton (1933), it goes back much earlier. It was already the basis of the well-known rational method, introduced 150 years ago by Mulvany (1850), and of the various runoff routing procedures subsequently derived implicit in the unit hydrograph, as originally proposed by Sherman (1932a; b). In these and other early studies concerned with maximal rates of runoff in problems of flooding and erosion, it was assumed that the infiltration rate is smaller than the precipitation rate over the entire catchment. In the rational method, the infiltration is taken as a fraction of the precipitation, whereas in the unit hydrograph approach and in Horton’s work, the infiltration capacity or a related index is subtracted from the precipitation. Thus it was assumed that the infiltrated water is “lost” and that virtually all stormflow results from the overland flow of the precipitation excess (see Figure 11.2). In the prediction of extreme flows for design purposes in disaster situations, this assumption of overland flow was not unreasonable. It is now understood that overland flow is not a universally occurring phenomenon, that in many situations it may not occur at all, and that its prevalence depends on the nature of the catchment and of the intensity of the precipitation. But it can be expected to be the main mechanism in catchments with relatively impermeable surfaces, and with only a thin soil layer; such surfaces cover mostly urban environments, factory and farm yards and other trampled soil areas, and rocky and stony areas with little or no soil or vegetation, as seen in arid and desert environments. Thus it occurs most frequently in areas where people live and work and in denuded arid regions. It can also occur on other more permeable surfaces, provided the rainfall is sufficiently intense. For instance, in a study of a 20 ha first-order agricultural catchment with steep slopes in semi-arid Shanxi streamflow generation Fig.11.3 Schematicillustrationof theoverlandflow(OF) mechanismassaturation excess:(a)thepositionof thewatertable(WT)prior totheonsetofprecipitation and(b)duringthe precipitationevent.

Occurrence and yield of overland flow varied spatially on account of the variability of the infiltration capacity. Ingeneral,infiltrationexcessoverlandflowappearstoberareinnaturalbasinscovered with a thriving vegetation in more humid climates. Saturation excess overland flow This type of surface runoff occurs over land surfaces that are saturated by emerging subsurface outflow from below and perched water tables, regardless of the intensity of the rainfall (or snowmelt) (see Figure 11.3). It is a rapid and almost immediate transport mechanism to the stream channel, for the seepage outflow water and for the rainwater falling (or snow melting) on such areas.

The expanding and shrinking areas are often referred to as variable source areas (see Figure 11.4). On the basis of hill slope measurements in Vermont, Dunne and Black (1970a; b) also concluded that the stormflow originated fromsurfaceflowonlimitedareasalongthestreamchannel.However,theirinterpretation of the mechanism was that this surface runoff was not fed significantly by subsurface outflow, but resulted mostly from rainfall on the expanding streamside areas; the role of the subsurface flow was mainly to control the expansion and subsequent contraction of the source areas. Butsaturationexcessoverlandflowdoesnotalwaysoccurintheimmediatevicinityof the stream. In a tropical rainforest in northeast Queensland, Bonnell and Gilmour (1978) and Elsenbeer et al.

{"text": "11.2.2 Subsurface stormflow In many catchments under natural conditions infiltration is never exceeded, and the precipitation and other input can readily enter into the ground surface; thus the sub- sequent flow to the stream channel takes place below the surface, presumably through the soil mantle of the catchment. Lowdermilk (1934) and Hursh (1936) appear to have been among the first to propose subsurface flow as the main streamflow generation mechanism in forested hill slopes (see also Hewlett,1974). It was later confirmed in sev- eral experimental investigations that subsurface flow can even be the only mechanism Weyman, 1970). The notion that subsurface flow is an important, and sometimes the only process of water transmission, was resisted by many on the grounds that porous media flow is generally much too slow compared with overland flow to be able to produce the observed streamflows. One early explanation of this paradox was suggested by Hursh (1944),whoassumedthatthetransporttakesplacethroughsecondaryporosityofparticle aggregates, forming a three-dimensional lattice pattern, and through hydraulic pathways consisting of dead root channels and animal burrows (see also Section 8.3.1). At the time, this possibility of macropore flow and piping seems to have been largely dismissed asunrealisticbyexperimentalistsandmostlyignoredbymodelers.However,subsequent experimentalworkinthefield,someofitwithchemicalandisotopictracers,hasproduced ampleandincontrovertibleevidencenotonlyformacroporeflowanditsimportance,but for several other mechanisms enhancing subsurface flow as well. These are considered more closely in what follows. Macropores and other preferential flow paths The concept of preferential flow paths or macropores is an old one; “little channels” and “light soil, mixed with pebbles and roots of trees” were invoked as early as the 1680s by Mariotte to explain infiltration and to refute the claims of Seneca and Perrault that rain water cannot possibly penetrate the soil to be the source of springs. In general, macropores can be defined as secondary, often pipe-like structures of the soil matrix, thataretheremainsofpurelyphysicalprocesses,suchaserosioninitiatedbydesiccation cracking, and different forms of biological activity, such as decaying plant root channels storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.5 Schematicrepresentationofasoilprofilewithafragipanhorizon.(FromSmalleyandDavin,1982, afterVanVlietandLangohr,1981.) andanimalburrowsofvarioussizes.ReviewsonthesubjecthavebeenpresentedbyJones (1971) and Beven and Germann (1982). Because soil drying and biological activity tend to take place near the ground surface, pipes and macropores are usually most abundant in the top soil layers and they tend to become less frequent with depth. Such structures are usually obvious features of soil profiles at banks and road cuts. In addition to these macropores, different other types of preferential flow paths have been observed, which may also have ramifications for the relative transport of pre-event and event water to the stream channel. Recall that pre-event water, also called old water, is the water present in the soil mantle before the onset of the precipitation, whereas the event water, often called new water, is the water resulting from the precipitation. In one type of preferential flow, the paths can often be observed at the surface of clayey and loamysoilsascracksorfracturesresultingfromtheshrinkageoftheclayparticlesduring drying episodes. At least during the initial stages of a precipitation event, before clay swelling closes them again, such cracks can facilitate the downward water movement in the profile. A somewhat related type of preferential flow has been observed in fissured fragipan horizons (Parlange et al., 1989), as illustrated in Figure 11.5. A fragipan is streamflow generation typically a loamy clay layer with very low conductivity and higher bulk density than the overlying layers. However, in some cases during their evolution, fragipan horizons became fractured into a polygonal columnar structure with a network of interconnected vertical fissures, again, as a result of shrinkage of the clay particles; these cracks are then believed to have been filled with more permeable soil material from above, greatly facilitating water transport. The cracks are typically 10–20 cm wide. In another type of preferentialflow,thepathsareinitiallyestablishedasinstabilitiesorfingersatinfiltrating wetting fronts in coarse soils, when the infiltration rate is smaller than the saturated conductivity. A crucial point, however, is that, once established, these paths usually become permanent features of the profile, each time the soil is being rewetted (Glass et al., 1989); exceptions may occur when the soil has undergone complete drying out or completesaturation,bothofwhicharerareifnotunlikelyinnature.Figure11.6showsan example of the initial growth of fingers observed in the laboratory. Such fingers are not so obvious in the soil profile, but they become visible with dyes or other tracers. Other aspects of the nature and origin of this type of preferential paths have been clarified (see Selker al., 1992; Liu al., 1994a; b). Although the existence of macropores has been known for a long time, the precise nature of their contribution to the streamflow generation processes has been emerging only gradually. A few examples follow of investigations in which macropores were observed to play a major role. In a small basin in east-central Honshu, Tanaka et al. (1981; 1988) observed that more than 90% of the storm runoff came from below the ground surface mainlythroughpipeflow;somesaturationoverlandflowoccurredoverthegentlerslopes (S of the valley floor, when the rainfall exceeded 50 mm; the saturated area varied somewhat in location and extent from storm to storm, but it never occupied more than 4.5% of the total area (see Figures 11.7 and 11.8). No overland flow was ever observed on the steep (S hillsides. In a 0.47 ha forested catchment in Tennessee, Wilson al. (1991) found that the initial subsurface stormflow water in moderate to high intensity events consisted mainly of new, i.e. event water; they concluded from this that it had bypassed the unsaturatedsoilmatrix,inwhichthepre-eventwaterwasstored,viamacroporeswithout ever reaching the water table. Later on, however, as the flow continued, the fraction of old water gradually increased.

In summer, however, overland flow was found to be dominant; they did not observe evidence of partial area sources, as only a negligible fraction of the catchment was occupied by wetland. OnasteepforestedhillslopewithcedarandcypressinIbarakiineast-centralHonshu, Tsuboyama et al. (1994) observed a dynamic system of macropores, which expanded and conducted increasing amounts of water as antecedent conditions became wetter. Continued studies on that same catchment (Noguchi et al. 1999; Sidle et al., 2001) led storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.6 Typicaldevelopmentofanunstablewettingfrontresultinginapersistentfingeredflowpattern;the roundholesindicatethepositionsofthetensiometersinthetwo-dimensionalsand-filledchamberto monitorthewaterpressuresduringtheexperiment,andthenumbersindicatetime(s)afterthestart oftheinfiltration.(FromSelkeretal.,1992.) streamflow generation Fig.11.7 Maximalextentofthesaturatedareasanddistributionofsubsurfaceoutflowpointsatthepeak dischargerateofa195mmstorminSeptember1980onasteep0.022km2 catchmentwithinthesource regionoftheTamaRiver.Thesaturatedareaoccupiedroughly3.3%ofthebasinareaandthearea shownrepresentsroughlyonequarterofthebasinarea.(FromTanakaetal.,1981.) to the more specific view that, while individual macropore segments are usually shorter than0.5m,theytendtoself-organize,aswetnessincreases,intolargerflowsystemswith such preferential flow connections between them as buried pockets of organic material and loose soil, small depressions of bedrock substrate, and fractures in the weathered bedrock. Chemical analysis of measurements on a 0.75 ha forested first-order catchment in the sub-Andean foreland basin of Peru by Elsenbeer et al. (1995b) indicated that the stormflow response is dominated by event water. This water traveled to the stream channel as a combination of overland flow and through pipes. Some pipe flow reached the stream directly, but some emerged to the surface before reaching the stream. The overland flow was thus generated by emerging pipe flow and directly by the rain. This made them observe that, from the perspective of the catchment, the distinction betweenpipeflowandoverlandflowismeaningless,asbothmechanismsproducedevent From observations in a semiarid pine forest in New Mexico, Newman et al. (1998) concluded that most of the lateral subsurface flow takes place in the B horizon through macropores.Thusthroughoutmostoftheyear,thesoilprofilebehaveslikeatwo-domain storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.8 Theprecipitation andrunoff hydrographofthe 195mmstorm eventonthe catchmentshown inFigure11.7. (FromTanaka etal.,1981.) system; this consists of a macropore domain, which provides rapid subsurface flow that is not in equilibrium with the soil matrix, and of a matrix domain, in which the trans- port is very slow and in which evaporative processes cause major water losses and increased salinity (see Figure 11.9). Variations in the ratio of old to new water in the runoff were seen to depend mainly on the size of the precipitation event; macropores can conduct the flow directly or they may also feed shallow perched saturated zones overly- ing low permeability bedrock. Whenever the entire profile is fully saturated, as during snowmelt episodes, the two domains are connected, and large subsurface flow rates are produced. In the above studies it was shown how subsurface flow through macropores and other preferential flow paths can play a major role in storm runoff generation. However, the specific interpretations of the measurements, especially on the relative roles of old and newwaterinthisprocess,differedsomewhat,andinsomecasestheywerecontradictory. Although this is largely the result of the wide variety in catchments that were being studied, it is no doubt also related to the differences in experimental techniques used in these studies. This was brought out, for example, in the long-term observations, carried out on the steep mixed evergreen forest catchments (1.63–8.26 ha) in a humid climate (2600 mm y at Maimai in New Zealand; a succession of detailed studies has streamflow generation New water A-horizon lateral flow has a higher matrix flow component than B horizon, possibly as a result of ponding on top of the B horizon. B-horizon lateral flow is dominantly through preferential flow paths with some matrix flow during saturated periods. Flow into tuff appears to be minor compared with that in the A and B horizons.

On the basis of subsequent investigations with electrical conductivity and natural tracers, Pearce et al. (1986) and Sklash et al. (1986) arrivedatadifferentconclusion;theydeducedfromthemeasurementsthatitwasmainly old water throughflow that was responsible for hydrograph generation, and that the flow of new water above the ground surface or below it through the soil matrix or through macropores could not explain the streamflow response. To resolve these discrepancies, a third set of studies was carried out by McDonnell (1990; McDonnell et al., 1991a) in whichachemicaltraceranalysiswassupplementedwithsoilwaterpressureobservations by means of tensiometers installed in near-stream, mid-hollow and upslope positions. It was observed that the soil water pressure response was dependent on storm magnitude, intensity and antecedent water content. For storm events producing peak runoff less than 2 mm h the water appeared to infiltrate downward as a wetting front in the soil matrix without appreciable macropore bypass flow; no water table developed along the slope and the streamflow consisted of old water issuing mainly from the near stream valley bottom groundwater. For events with peak storm runoff in excess of 2 mm h storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.10 PerceptualrunoffproductionmechanismsinamidslopehollowofahumidcatchmentinNewZealand. movesdownthroughverticalcracks.Theinvadingnewwaterperchesatthesoil–bedrockinterface, andbacksupintothenewlysaturatedsoilmatrix,whereitmixeswiththemuchlargervolumeof storedoldwater.Oncefreewater(withpositiveporewaterpressures)exists,thelargerpipesinthe lowersoilzonesquicklydissipatetransientwatertableslaterallydownslope,producingarapid throughflowresponseofwell-mixed,albeitmainlypre-eventwater.(FromMcDonnell,1990.) the lower soil horizons along the slope responded almost instantaneously, indicating a rapid macropore flow, as Mosley (1979) had already surmised. The predominance of old water in the streamflow runoff was explained by McDonnell (1990) by the fact that the rapid flow of new rainwater through downward crack macropores backs up into the soil matrix at the soil–bedrock interface, which is still dry; this rapidly causes saturated conditions, and results in the emergence of well-mixed old water from the matrix into lateral pipe macropores and rapid downslope transport (see Figure 11.10). In a fourth set of experiments, Woods and Rowe (1996) dug a trench 60 m long and 1.5 m deep along the toe of a hillslope hollow, with 30 subsurface flow collection points along its length. The outflow from the hillslope was found to be very variable; this led to the conclusion that outflow data from single hillslope throughflow pits should not be extrapolated to an entire hillslope and further (Woods et al., 1997) that this variability depends on wetness and surface topography. The latter conclusion was refuted by McDonnell and associates streamflow generation Fig.11.11 Schematicillustrationofthe rapidsubsurfacestormflow (SF)throughvarioustypesof I n f i l t r a t i o n preferentialflowpaths, pipesandmacropores.The relativeamountsofnew (dashedarrows)andoldwater (solidarrows)inthemixing processdependmainlyonthe B e d r o c k precipitationintensityandon thepre-stormsoilmoisture conditions. (McGlynn al., 2002) on the basis of a fifth set of hillslope-scale tracer measurements with bromide at the same catchment. The main conclusion from that study was that it is not the surface topography, but rather the spatial pattern of the bedrock topography, with local preferential flow and mobile and immobile regions, conditioned by small local depressions in the bedrock, which controls the tracer outflow variability; tracer material and old water may remain trapped temporarily in such depressions and become mobilized only by a new storm event. From measurements in a forested Canadian Shield basin in Ontario, Peters et al. (1995) concluded that preferential flow channels brought the water vertically down, after which it flowed laterally over the bedrock and that practically all the lateral flow occurred within a thin weathered zone near the soil–bedrock interface. The conductivity of this preferential flow layer appeared to be so large that some of the fast flows and peak runoff were suspected to be of the non-Darcy type. The storm runoff in the channel consisted of a mixture of event and pre-event water. This was interpreted to show that thefastinfiltrationoftheeventwatercausedsaturatedsoilconditionsabovethebedrock, which in turn resulted in the downhill flow of both event and pre-event water; moreover, during the hillslope transport, there was ample opportunity for interaction between the event runoff water and the soil matrix. Insummary,thesubsurfacestormflow,observedinseveralofthehillslopeexperiments reviewed here, exhibited the common feature of unimpeded entry by new water from rainfallintothesoil,followedimmediatelybyrapiddownslopeflowthroughpreferential paths, pipes and other macropores; this flow involved mixing with the old water already presentinthesoilprofile(seeFigure11.11),tovaryingdegreesdependingontheintensity of the rain and on the initial moisture status of the soil mantle. Throughflow in a shallow permeable layer In many catchments covered with natural vegetation the soil mantle has a relatively permeable top layer consisting of organic debris and mineral soil with high organic content; typically, this layer has a thickness of only a few tens of centimeters and its bottom interface is characterized by an abrupt decline in hydraulic conductivity in the underlying mineral soil. Thus infiltrating rainwater tends to flow and build up along storm runoff mechanisms this interface and develop a perched water table and fully saturated conditions, although deeper layers may remain partially saturated. In several experimental studies it has been observed that such layers can be effective enough to be a major, and sometimes even the main transport medium for stormflow. As noted above, this type of flow was observed to occur by Bonnell and Gilmour (1978), in conjunction with saturation over- land flow, in a catchment in Queensland. The chemical signatures of hillslope waters in a catchment in Wales made also Chappell et al. (1990) conclude that this can indeed be the dominant mechanism for water and ion transport to lower near-stream riparian zones. Similarly, Jenkins et al. (1994) used natural tracers to characterize rain water, soil water and ground water in a moorland catchment in northeast Scotland. The inter- face between mineral soil layers and the upper organic layers of peaty podsol were identified as preferential pathways. Flow of water in this upper layer was observed to be triggered nearly instantaneously by the onset of the rain, and also to stop nearly as suddenly as the rain ceased; the water in this layer had a chemistry very similar to that of the rain. In the runoff hydrograph, the peak flow was found to be domi- nated by rain and soil water, whereas the recession part was dominated by pre-event groundwater. Although they did not consider this type of flow as being representative of the entire catchment, McDonnell et al. (1991b) did observe it on small portions of the Maimai catchments in New Zealand. During a rain storm event of some 47 mm and with the soil water suctions initially ranging between H 60 and 150 cm water column, most of the water was seen to flow out from the organic soil layer perched on the mineral soil profile;allthewhile,thelowersoilprofileremainedonlypartlysaturated.Morerecently, from an experimental study on seven nested (from 8 to 161 ha) forest catchments in the Catskill Mountains of New York, Brown et al. (1999) concluded that a large fraction of the rapid delivery to the stream took place through this same mechanism. Event water appeared to be most prevalent in the stormflow especially during dry conditions, with relative contributions between 50% and 62% near peak flow. Wavelike mobilization of the water table As illustrated in Figures 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7, for most soils within the nearly saturated capillary fringe, a small change in water content can result in a relatively large change in pore water pressure. This has led to the view that the addition of a very small amount of watertoarelativelymoistsoilcanraisethewatertablerapidly,almostasapressurewave type of propagation, to produce a saturated soil profile. Wherever the profile becomes fully saturated this way, subsurface flow may emerge and saturation excess overland flow is also bound to occur. This type of water table rise may be especially fast in the lower parts of the hillslope and may result in the build up of an emerging groundwater mound, exhibiting greatly increased hydraulic gradients and groundwater discharge to the channel, and forming a partial or variable source area producing saturation excess overland flow as well. Thus the phenomenon is not unlike that depicted in Figure 11.3, except that here the water table rise is presumed to involve very little actual water movement. streamflow generation Phenomena interpreted to be the result of this type of mechanism were observed, for example, in a swampy area by Novakowski and Gillham (1988) and in a grass-covered low relief basin by Abdul and Gillham (1989), both in Ontario. In these studies, the rise of the water table was most pronounced in the near-stream areas. The mechanism has also been inferred to occur in more rugged terrain. During a sprinkler irrigation experiment on a very steep (43%) forested hillslope near Coos Bay in Oregon, Torres et al. (1998) applied a sudden input spike, after the system had been driven to a steady state flow and the soil water pressures were mostly between 0 and cm. They supposed that the timing and magnitude of the pore water pressure and of the dis- charge rate response to this sudden input were much faster than could be expected from advective water movement, and concluded that the fast response was triggered by a pressure wave moving undetected through the unsaturated zone; thus a small amount of rain on a wet soil profile can supposedly result in a rapid rise in the satu- rated zone, with a relatively slight increase in hydraulic gradient and a large increase in hydraulic conductivity. They also observed some preferential flow, but they felt that in this particular soil, this effect was minor compared to that of the soil water retention characteristics. The concept that suction-saturated capillary fringe water can be easily converted into water below the water table, that is from a negative to a positive pressure, by a relatively small amount of rain, is undoubtedly realistic. Clearly, only a little additional water is required to mobilize the soil water, when the soil is already close to saturation. But the importance of this mechanism should be kept in perspective. For example, it can only be expected to be effective when the pore water pressure in the top layers of the soil is arrived at during a drainage phase and not during a wetting phase; as illustrated in Figures 8.14, 8.18 and 8.19, the capillary fringe is usually much smaller in the wetting cycle.Similarly,intheabsenceofanymacroporesorpipes,thewatertable(i.e.thelocus ofatmospheric-orzero-porewaterpressure)canonlybeexpectedtomoverapidlydown a steep slope, if it is already close to the surface. As illustrated in Figure 10.12, the drainable porosity n is smaller when the water table is closer to the surface, that is when ) is smaller. While not a perfect representation, hydraulic groundwater theory, asformulatedbytheBoussinesqequation(10.29)anditslinearizedform(10.134),isalso fully consistent with this. This can be seen by considering the advectivity in Equation c (11.2) it describes the speed of propagation of a given water table height (or of a disturbance ofthewatertableresultingfromrainfall)downtheslope.Thisshowsthat,intheabsence of preferential flow paths, large values of c can result only when the drainable porosity issmall.AsseeninEquation(10.151),thisisequallyconsistentwiththekinematicwave approximation. Capillarityinducedflowenhancementhasalsobeenlinkedtosoilstratification.Insit- uationswhereafine-texturedsoillayeroverliesamorecoarse-grainedmaterial,theinter- face between the two layers can develop into a capillary barrier (Ross, 1990; Steenhuis summary of mechanisms et al., 1991). On account of the different soil water characteristics in the two layers, for a given water pressure at the interface, at equilibrium the soil water content in the upper layer is normally larger than in the lower coarse-textured layer. As a result, the hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer may be considerably larger than in the lower layer; this is illustrated in Figure 8.26. In such a case infiltrating rain water will not readily enter into this lower layer but will tend to be diverted laterally and may cause a rapid rise in water table further down the slope if the water in the upper layer is already close to suction-saturated. Field observations within the source region of the Tama River in east-central Honshu by Marui (1991; Tanaka, 1996) on a hillslope unit, characterized by a 4 mthick fine-grained loam layer underlain by 15 m thick gravel layer, were con- sistent with this sequence of events. He observed a large-scale groundwater ridge along the steep hillslope. In addition, the air in the underlying partly saturated gravel seemed to be confined by the surrounding groundwater body, and by the saturated zone in the loam layer. In a separate study, Onodera (1991; Tanaka, 1996) inferred that the result- ing air pressure increase may have led to increased groundwater outflow at the slope surface. In conclusion, it stands to reason, that mechanisms related to capillarity can lead to so-called groundwater “ridging” not only in riparian areas, but also along hillslopes, wherever the capillary fringe is already close to the ground surface. However, until now no experiments have demonstrated that by itself this type of phenomenon is related to the hydrograph; thus, whether or not this mechanism can explain large subsurface stormflows remains to be answered."}

These mechanisms can be overland flow due to infiltration excess precipitation, or to saturation excess near the soil surface, resulting either from return outflow from the subsurface, or from rapidly mobilized capillary fringe water in the soil profile to full saturation. On steep slopes overland flow is more likely on converging sections in hollows. The mechanisms can also be subsurface flow of water in a number of different ways. Especially during large rainfallevents,thiscaninvolvedifferenttypesofmacroporesandpreferentialflowpaths, namely as vertical bypass flow to some depth, and then as lateral flow through pipes or through a shallow porous soil layer with high organic content or at the soil bedrock interface. At the same time a slower and less localized throughflow takes place in the soil matrix. Several of these mechanisms have been found to be more than adequate to produce high-intensity runoff events. It is also striking that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and that in many situations they coexist and operate interactively in the production of streamflow; their relative importance then depends on the prevailing streamflow generation conditions, such as initial moisture conditions in the catchment and the magnitude of the precipitation. In some cases the coexistence of different mechanisms can give rise to some unusual phenomena. For instance, under low initial conditions in a watershed in central Cˆ ote d’Ivoire,Masiyandimaetal.(2003)observeddouble-peakedhydrographsresultingfrom the same rainfall burst; the first peak, which occurred while it rained, was produced by therainfallonthesaturatedvalleybottom;thesecondpeak,whichcameminutestohours after the first, resulted from the rain that had fallen on the area surrounding the valley bottom and that had traveled to the stream channel by subsurface flow. All this underscores again the extreme complexity of the stream generation process. These observations suggest that a single unifying runoff model may not be possible nor even desirable, and they have profound implications for the development of modeling strategies for predictive purposes in applied hydrology. Identification of major mechanisms Inordertokeeptheformulationsufficientlysimpleandparsimonious,itmaybenecessary toidentifyandincludeonlythedominantmechanismsforanygivensetofconditions,and toacceptsomeinevitableuncertaintyresultingfromtheomissionoftheremainingminor mechanisms. On the basis of a knowledge of these local conditions, the analyst must then decide which mechanisms are the major ones that must be considered to represent a particular catchment. The insight gained by the recent field observations can also give some guidance in this. For instance, different kinds of subsurface flow can be assumed to dominate the runoff process in humid areas with an active vegetation. Well-developed mineralsoilsundoubtedlyfavorthedevelopmentofpreferentialflowpaths,whereasthin porous soils with organic litter probably lead to shallow lateral flow of the perched water above the less permeable soil or bedrock. Wetland areas near the stream may allow rapid mobilization or ridging of the water table, and the development of partial and variable sourceareas,onwhichsaturationexcessoverlandflowcantakeplace.Infiltrationexcess overland flow will be prevalent during large precipitation events on unvegetated surfaces in arid regions and in areas subject to intense human activities. Objectives of the analysis This wide variety in possible mechanisms also means that, in the development of mod- eling strategies for engineering and other applied purposes, for a given catchment it may be advisable to adopt different formulations depending on the objectives of the analysis. For example, the prediction of disastrous flash flooding, under extreme precipitation conditions, may require an entirely different approach from those needed to describe solutetransportandwaterqualityintheenvironment,toanalyzepossibleclimatechange scenarios under more normal flow regimes, or to assess the potential for erosion or land- slides. For flood prediction, mainly the flows at a certain point along the river may be of interest;forclimatechangescenarios,surface–atmosphereinteractionsareofparamount importance; and for water quality purposes it may be crucial to know the pathways, in order to determine the fate and transport of admixtures and water pollutants; finally, summary of mechanisms erosion and landslide hazards tend to be related to the pore water pressure distribution and the local flow velocities. Appropriate parameter values But even for the same formulation, it may also be necessary to adopt different parameter values depending on the flow regime. The formulation of river flow usually requires dif- ferent values of the roughness parameter in the Gauckler–Manning or Ch´ ezy equations, dependingonwhetheritislowflowwithintheregularchannelorhighflowwithflooding outside the banks. Similarly, in the description of hillslope outflow by some of the sub- surfaceparameterizationsofChapter10,theappropriatevaluesoftheeffectivehydraulic conductivity k and of the thickness of the flow region , used to represent stormflow conditions with active macropores, will be considerably larger than those appropriate for conditions of baseflow, after the water tables have subsided and many of the macro- pores in the upper soil layers have emptied and are no longer active. Actually, because of the high flow velocities, subsurface stormflows may not be of the Darcy type, and it may be necessary to use Forchheimer’s Equation (8.34) with an additional transmission parameter beside the hydraulic conductivity. Ultimately, the performance, in a general sense, of any kind of parameterization and of the resulting model, has to be judged on the basis of its ability to simulate or replicate observations of the variables of interest.

{"text": "11.3.2 How to put it all together? Distributed versus lumped approach As already explained in Chapter 1, scale is the appropriate criterion to classify the differentmethodologies.Accordingly,onecandistinguishtwogeneralclassesofmodels that have been used in the past to simulate streamflow generation. In the distributed models, also called models, the computational scales are much smaller runoff routing than the flow domain characterizing the catchment, whereas in the lumped models the computational scale is essentially of the same order as that of the catchment. The main feature of the distributed approach is that the basin outflow is obtained by tracking the water through its different transport phases in the basin interior. In brief, these phases are surface and subsurface transport into the stream channel network, in response to precipitation after it reaches the ground surface, and the subsequent open channel flow to the basin outlet; between precipitation episodes the basin outflow is dominated by baseflow and evaporation processes. The different mechanisms in each of these transport phases may be described by combining some of the formulations of the relevantprocesses,aspresentedinChapters2–10.Theseformulationsinvariablyinvolve a number of assumptions neglecting certain aspects of the flow, which are considered to be less important; this means that they can be only simplified representations of reality. The distributed approach has been receiving increasing acceptance in recent years with the advent of digital computation and with the growing availability of higher-resolution streamflow generation data from digital terrain and other geographical information systems; rapid advances continue to be reported in the literature. Among the main advantages of distributed models one can note that they allow the exploration of the consequences of various simplifying assumptions; as a result, they can lead to a better understanding of the various pathways and of the interplay between the main processes and related aspects of complex hydrologic systems in the real world. They can also be useful in the prediction of outflow from headwater catchments, pro- vided their parameters can be determined. But this requirement subsumes also one of their main shortcomings. Ideally, the parameters should be determined a priori, that is independentlyfromthemodel’sperformance.Inmanycases,however,thisisimpossible andtheparametersmustbeestimatedbycalibration.Butthen,distributedmodelstendto containsomanyparametersthatitbecomespracticallyimpossibletoestimatethemallin objectiveandphysicallyconsistentways.Anothermajordrawbackisthattheunderlying mathematical rigor of the parameterizations of the model components may instill in the practitioneraconfidenceandasenseofrealismabouttheirperformance,thattheydonot deserve, on account of the many simplifications and uncertainties involved. As a result, the limitations of such models may not be fully understood by uninitiated users and they may be applied to situations for which they were not intended. In contrast, the lumped models, whose computational scales are of the same order of magnitude as the catchment scales, rely on fewer parameters, which are generally easier toestimatefromtheavailabledata.Therefore,theyareeasiertoapplyinbasinoutletflow simulationsforpredictionandforecastingpurposes.Unfortunately,asthecomputational scaleincreases,itbecomesincreasinglydifficulttogiveaphysicalinterpretationtothese parameters, in the sense of the processes described in Chapters 2–10. This means that it is usually impossible topredict changes in these parameters,asthe catchment undergoes physical changes, such as those resulting from an evolving land use or changing climate. Another drawback is that even when the catchment characteristics remain unchanged, catchment-scale parameters are incapable of accommodating spatial variability of the input(e.g.rainfall)andoftheflowprocesses(e.g.infiltrationandevaporation).Moreover, it is impossible to use this approach to describe the detailed flow paths required in the predictionofpollutanttransportorerosion.Inspiteofalltheseshortcomings,thelumped approach continues to be useful in the prediction of streamflow for certain operational and design purposes. Specific implementations of this approach are further treated in detail in Chapter 12. Again, in closing this review, it should be understood that, although a classification into distributed and lumped models is useful to bring some order in the multitude of possible approaches, it is also somewhat artificial. Comparison of the different methods treated in Chapters 5–10 has made it clear that the lumped kinematic approach is merely the simplest extreme in a continuous range of complexity levels, which can be applied in up-scaling the analysis from the finest resolution of the full space- and time-dependent conservation equations of momentum, energy and mass to the coarsest resolution, that is the scale of the catchment itself. However, the level of model complexity necessary for a specific application is still not well known; nor is it clear what scenarios warrant the use of more complex models or under what conditions a distributed model will consistently references outperform lumped models. In other words, there is still no general consensus regarding the optimal simplifying assumptions that are most appropriate to describe streamflow generation under a given set of conditions. Although it could be argued that there never will be a consensus, this field is in an active state of development and rapid advances continue to be made. REFERENCES Abdul, A. S. and Gillham, R. W.

The basic philosophy of this type of approach is that the physical processes are assumed to take place at the scale of the catchment, without consideration for the detailed subscale processes or for the intricacies of the flow paths inside the watershed. In a sense, this is analogous with the view espoused in continuum mechanics orthermodynamics(albeitintheirownrespectivescaleranges),whereonlythe“macro” or “everyday” properties of the fluids are taken into account, without consideration of their properties at the molecular or nuclear scales. Because by far most applications of the lumped approach in the past have been based on the assumptions of linearity and stationarity, these will be treated first and in greatest detail."}
{"text": "12.1.1 Basic concept Definition The unit hydrograph, or unit graph, can be defined as the hydrograph of unit volume of storm runoff produced by a unit volume of uniform (in space and in time) intensity excess rainfall over a unit period , with the basic assumptions of and D linearity time invariance. As defined here, the unit hydrograph is the response function of a linear system, which is treated in more general terms in the Appendix, and can be denoted by respectively, the storm runoff per unit of catchment area and the intensity of excess rainfallorotherinputperunitcatchmentarea,whichdirectlyproducesthisstormrunoff; note that in some practical applications, the determination of and may require the abstraction of baseflow and of the interception or deep infiltration of the precipitation. According to the definition of Equation (A9), in the present context the assumption of linearity or superposition means that the hydrograph, resulting from any input pattern of rainfall or snowmelt, can be built up from separate unit hydrographs by superposition, that is, after scaling them in magnitude and after sequencing them in time. In light of the definition (A10), the assumption of invariance or stationarity means that the runoff from a given catchment due to a given input pattern is the same, regardless of the particular circumstances; thus there are no effects or feedbacks resulting from current conditions (e.g. season) or antecedent input during the event. The unit volume and unit periodarearbitrary,buttheycanbetaken,forexample,as1cmovertheentireareaofthe streamflow response at the catchment scale Exampleofaunithydrographu u(Du;t);itsvolumeis1cmoverthecatchmentareaanditresults Fig.12.1 fromaunitvolumeprecipitationexcesswithanintensity cmh lastingaunitduration catchmentand1horamultiplethereof,respectively.Theconceptoftheunithydrograph was introduced by Sherman (1932a,b) as a method of extending available data, in order to predict floods resulting from more complex and higher intensity storms, than those on record. Example 12.1. Application of unit hydrograph To illustrate this concept, Figure 12.1 shows an example of a 2 hunit hydrograph for a certain catchment; the numerical values are listed in Table 12.1. This hydrograph represents the storm runoff from the catchment, produced by a rainfall excess which has a unit volume, i.e. 1 cm, and a unit duration 2h. To achieve this unit volume, the rainfall intensity is of necessity 0.5 cm over the 2 h period. This unit hydrograph can now be used to calculate the storm runoff produced by any pattern of spatially uniform excess rainfall. Consider the following sequence: 1 cm for 0 2h, 2 cm for 2 4 h, and 1.5 cm for 4 6h. The t x t x t first rainfall burst, i.e. 1 cm has twice the intensity of the input that produces the unit hydrograph; therefore it produces a storm runoff hydrograph, whose magnitude is twice that of the unit hydrograph. The second burst, i.e. 2 cm has four times the intensity of the input that produces the unit hydrograph, and so on. The ordinates of the resulting three hydrographs are then added to yield the storm hydrograph, as illustrated in Figure 12.2. Practical limitations The assumptions of linearity and invariance have their limitations, and the requirements of uniformity are rarely met. For example, the assumption of linearity implies that the stationary linear response Table12.1Valuesofthe2hunithydrographusedinExample12.1 h−1) h−1) 0 0.0000 6.5 0.0654 0.5 0.0080 7 0.0477 1 0.0414 7.5 0.0342 1.5 0.0963 8 0.0242 2 0.1610 8.5 0.0169 2.5 0.2195 9 0.0118 3 0.2471 9.5 0.0081 3.5 0.2433 10 0.0055 4 0.2190 10.5 0.0037 4.5 0.1851 11 0.0025 5 0.1494 11.5 0.0017 5.5 0.1164 12 0.0011 6 0.0883 12.5 0.0008 Fig.12.2 Exampleofthestormrunoff(heavyline)calculatedbymeansofthe2hunithydrographshownin Figure12.1,resultingfromastormwithexcessprecipitationratesof1cmh−1 for0 2 h,2cm h−1 h,and1.5cmh−1 for2 4 for4 6 h;thesesuccessivepulsesandtheirresponsesare indicatedbya,bandc.Therespectivevolumesare2,4and3cmoverthecatchmentarea. time scales of runoff remain independent of the magnitude of the input. This assumption is acceptable as long as the flow rates do not deviate too much from some average or characteristic values. However, nonlinearities can be expected to show up when the flow rate magnitudes of interest cover a wide range; this holds especially true over smaller catchments. For instance, in the case of free surface flow, the Ch´ ezy and GM equations, (5.39) and (5.41), indicate that the velocity depends on the water depth. This means that the more water is flowing in the rills, gutters and creek channels of the basin, the streamflow response at the catchment scale May 27, 1938 P=12.07 cm Sept. 2, 1941 P=6.73 cm Apr. 17, 1941 P=4.95 cm Oct. 22, 1941 P=3.35 cm July 20, 1948 P=2.41 cm 60 80 120 140 Time, t (min) Illustrationofthenonlinearfeaturesoftheunitresponseu(Du;t)ofaverysmall(0.11km2) Fig.12.3 x P)varies agriculturalcatchmentinIllinois,whentheexcessprecipitationinputrate (denotedhereas overawiderangebetween2.4and12.1cmh−1.Theunitduration wasnearlythesameforallfive casesandrangedbetween10and14min;theindicatedtimeisfromthestartoftheexcess precipitation.(AfterMinshall, 1960.) shorter the time to peak of the outflow hydrograph will be, and thus also the higher the peak flow rate will tend to be. This type of nonlinearity is illustrated in Figure 12.3. The unit hydrographs were derived from field data in a study by Minshall (1960) on a small agricultural catchment of 0.11 The durations were nearly the same for all five cases and ranged between 10 and 14 min, but the rainfall rates changed five-fold over a range between 24 and 121 mm This type of response may be called superlinear. However, watersheds need not always behave this way. For instance, in the extreme case ofalargeflood,whenthewaterspillsoverthebanksofthechannelontothefloodplain,it may happen that the flow is retarded by the larger roughness of the flood plain obstacles; the peak is then likely to arrive later than predicted by the unit hydrograph obtained from flows under more moderate flow conditions. This would be a case of sublinear response. The requirement of a spatially uniform rainfall input imposes an upper limit on the catchment area; for practical applications, an upper limit of the order of 1800 has been suggested by O’Kelly (1955)."}
{"text": "12.1.2 Extensions of original approach: alternative response functions S hydrograph This type of response function results from a uniform input of unit intensity, which con- tinues indefinitely. Thus with the same assumptions, as those used in the definition of the unit hydrograph, the S hydrograph can be obtained by superposing the unit hydro- graphsresultingfromanuninterruptedsequenceofunitrainfallvolumesofunitduration.

Therefore, the superposed unit hydrographs must be scaled, that is divided by this intensity (or multiplied by ), to obtain the S hydrograph for a continuous input of unit intensity. The main feature of the S hydrograph is that it allows the determination of the unit hydrograph for any other adopted unit period, say . This is accomplished graphically by time-shifting the S hydrograph time units to the right and by then subtracting thetime-shiftedfromtheoriginalShydrograph.Again,however,becausetheunitvolume (cid:3) (cid:3) musthaveanintensityequalto(1/D inputpulseofduration ),theresultingdifference must be multiplied by this amount to produce the output resulting from a unit volume input.

As illustrated in Figure 12.5, first an S curve, time-shifted byhalfanhour,issubtractedfromtheoriginalone.Aninputrateof lasting for half an hour produces a total volume of 0.5 cm. Therefore this difference must be scaled by multiplying it by 2, to obtain a unit runoff volume of 1 cm. The instantaneous unit hydrograph This is the outflow hydrograph resulting from an input of unit volume placed instanta- neouslyanduniformlyovertheentirecatchmentsurface,againundertheassumptionsof linearity and time-invariance. Clark (1945) was probably the first to apply this concept in runoff computations. As shown in the Appendix, an instantaneous input can be repre- sented by a Dirac delta function. Hence the instantaneous unit hydrograph is in fact the impulse response or Green’s function of the catchment. In the notation of the Appendix, it can be represented by u(t). It also means that the outflow from the catchment, in response to a uniform rainfall input of intensity x(t), can be obtained by means of For instance in the case of Equation (A14) this is = x(τ) − τ)dτ y(t) u(t (12.2) the catchment. Recall that y(t) is the storm runoff rate per unit area of catchment; stationary linear response Fig.12.6 Convolutionoperationwithaninstantaneous unithydrographu u(t),astheanalogof thesummationshowninFigure12.2,inthe Du dt y andu limitas 0.(Thevaluesof arenotdrawntoscale.)(Seealso FigureA5.) hence,forastreamflowrate Q(t)attheoutletofacatchmentofarea A,thefunction represents so that it has the dimensions just like x(t). This means that the dimensions of the unit response function in Equation (12.2) are [u] [T corresponding, for example, with the units of cm per hour of runoff per cm of rainfall input. In the operation represented by the convolution integral (12.2), 0 is defined as the start of the input rate x(t). At any given value of time t, the total output rate is the result of all past inputs from the start of the input at 0 until t, weighted at each instant with the unit response, as indicated in Figure 12.6, with the argument (t In the integration is the dummy time variable of integration, and is treated as a constant. (A more mathematical illustration of this or is given convolution folding in Figure A5.)

Because of this one-to-one relationship between the finite duration unit hydrograph and the instantaneous unit hydrograph, no distinction need be made between the two, and both can be referred to as unit response function. The instantaneous unit hydrograph can also be used to derive the S hydrograph by simply applying Equation (12.2) with a constant unit input rate, x(t) starting at 0, that is a unit step function as defined in Equation (A8), or = − τ)dτ (t) u(t (12.6) rule (A2) shows readily that the instantaneous unit hydrograph is the slope of the S hydrograph. Actually this also follows directly from Equation (12.1), as can be seen by letting the unit duration approach zero, or in the limit as 0 u(t) (12.7)"}
{"text": "12.2.1 From available data Simple storm events In principle, it should be relatively straightforward to determine the unit hydrograph, whenever the rainfall occurs as a single burst of acceptably uniform intensity and of a suitable duration, and is accompanied by an easily identifiable streamflow hydrograph. This may be done by first subtracting the baseflow from the observed hydrograph and by identification of linear response functions thenscalingtheremainderhydrographtothedesiredunitvolume,thatisbydividingitby the observed excess rainfall depth. Trial and error may be required in the determination of the baseflow and of the precipitation losses, to ensure that the excess rainfall volume equalsthestormrunoffvolumeoverthecatchmentarea.Severalunithydrographsderived from different storm events of a similar duration can be averaged in order to obtain a more representative result. If necessary, a common duration can also be obtained by means of their respective S hydrographs. Complex storm events More often than not, precipitation events do not have a uniform intensity in time and the resulting runoff hydrograph may be quite irregular. The unit hydrograph must then be estimated by considering its mathematical operation in some detail. Precipitation and also streamflow data are usually given with discrete time steps. According to Equation (A18), the discrete analog of the convolution integral is y(t) x(k (12.8) inwhichτ = n(cid:3)τ(≤ t)isthetimeofthelastinputpulsepriortothedesignatedresponse τ = (cid:3)τ time t.

Clearly, the number of ordinates of each of the functions must satisfy 1 (12.12) which is illustrated in the following example. Example 12.3. Numerical convolution Consider a rainfall event consisting of 3 rainfall input pulses, and 6 measured output hydrograph ordinates; this implies a discretized response function with 4 ordinates.

In the identification of the response characteristics of the system, as formu- ,u ,...,u that need to be determined. Because there are equations available, the sys- tem is over-determined. Nevertheless, one might be tempted to determine these identification of linear response functions u-values algebraically by forward substitution, for example with Equation (12.11) as ,u ,...,u and so on for . This could also be done by backward substitution, starting with as follows ,u ,...,u andsoonfortheremainingvaluesu .Thisprocedurewouldbefineifthe data were accurate and if the real system in nature were indeed to perform as formulated in these equations. Unfortunately, hydrologic data are invariably subject to considerable error and natural catchments tend to exhibit some nonlinear and non-stationary features in their response characteristics. Therefore, an optimal solution must be sought, which makes use of all available equations. Among the more common solution methods of a set of equations like (12.9) and (12.11) are those based on the least squares criterion (see Snyder, 1955) and on other mathematical programming techniques (see Deininger, 1969; Diskin and Boneh, 1973, Box al., 1994). The method of least squares The underlying criterion in this method consists of the minimization of the sum of the squares of the differences between the measured data and the calculated values in Equation (12.9). These differences are called the residuals, say . A simple example will illustrate how their squares can be minimized. Example 12.4. Application of least squares method Consider again the simple case described by Equation (12.13) and illustrated in Figure 12.8. The sum of the squares of the residuals is )2 )2 )2 (y (y (y x u x u x u x u x u x u 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 3 2 2 3 1 )2 )2 )2 x u x u x u x u x u x u 4 1 4 2 3 3 2 5 2 4 3 3 6 3 4 ∂ ε2 /∂u = This sum can be minimized by putting 0 for each value of i.

These constitute a system of four linear equa- tions for the four unknown values of , which can readily be solved. The technique may also be used in the solution of even more complex cases; various algorithms involving operations of matrix transposition and inversion are available and can be found in textbooks on numerical analysis. Transform methods of identification Beside the direct solution methods of Equations (12.9) and (12.11), numerous other methodsareavailabletoderiveoptimalu values.Inseveralofthese,byusingadifferent usually algebraic, relationship between the three is obtained, which is more tractable for computation than the convolution integral (12.2) or (12.9). In the method of moments, the functions are characterized by their moments. The optimal values, or the optimal constants in the function, that is used to describe u(t), are determined such that the moments of the calculated output function are equal to the moments of the observed output function y(t). In principle, this method is based on the application of the theorem aredescribedasFourierseriesexpansions.Theoptimalu valuesortheconstantsinu(t), are determined such that the constants of the Fourier series expansion of the calculated output are exactly the same as those of the observed output. In Fourier and Laplace transform methods, the functions are formulated, respectively, in the frequency domain and in the (i.e. the Laplace transform) domain. A review of the application of many of the identification methods investigated in earlier years in catchment hydrology has been presented by Dooge (1973). In practice, however, some of these techniques of direct identification from available data result in response functions, which can be quite sensitive to small errors in the measurements, exhibiting such “non-physical” features as severe oscillations or negative values. Ways of coping with such problems have been discussed by, among others, Neuman and de Marsily (1976) and Singh (1976)."}
{"text": "12.2.2 More concise parameterizations by linear runoff routing The data needed to derive the unit hydrograph for a given basin are not always available. Therefore, it should be no surprise that over the years many attempts have been made to develop methods enabling the prediction of this unit response function from basin characteristics. The goal of these studies was to derive unit hydrographs for ungaged watersheds from maps and from some other readily available physical attributes. In one class of methods, empirical equations and empirical curves were used to describe the unit hydrograph, with parameters in terms of basin characteristics. However, because of their strictly empirical nature, their applicability tends to be limited to the region where they were developed, and they will not be considered any further here. Inanotherclassofmethods,whichareofamorefundamentalinterest,varioustheoret- ical forms of the response function were proposed by postulating different combinations of model elements, which replicate the most important flow mechanisms to transform identification of linear response functions the precipitation into steamflow. In general, the response function is derived by routing a lumped rainfall excess input through a number of elements of storage and translation, whicharepatternedafterthedifferentprocessesasdescribedinChapters2–10;therefore, such methods might, in a certain sense, be considered physically based. One of the main advantagesofthesemethodsis,thattheresultingresponsefunctionsusuallyrequireonly few parameters; this makes them more general and also easier to calibrate. On the down- side, however, since their computational scale is so large, the correspondence with the actualphysicalprocessesisnotalwaysclear.Indeed,asthecomputationalscalebecomes much larger than the variability scales of the basin, the parameters gradually lose their original physical meaning. Because of this ambiguity, these types of parameterizations have also been called conceptual models (see Dooge, 1973). Linear translatory transport: the Rational Method This is probably the earliest attempt to relate precipitation with the resulting runoff from a catchment. Evidently (Dooge, 1957), the method was pioneered already some 150 years ago by Mulvany (1850) in Ireland, but versions of it are still being used today in the design of small drainage structures. The underlying concept of the method is that each catchment has a (constant) concentration, , which is the time needed for time of t the water to flow from the most distant point of the catchment to the outlet. The peak dischargerate takesplacewhentheentirecatchmentarea Acontributestotheoutflow, and this occurs at the time after the onset of the rain at 0. Thus for a mean input intensity (rainfall or snowmelt) over that period, the peak rate of flow is or, in input–output notation, in which such that [y ] and CI.

The equation proposed by Kirpich (1940), on the basis of Ramser’s (1927) data, is often quoted; this can be expressed as follows (cid:5) (cid:6) 0.062 (12.21) where is in hours, is the length of the main channel from the furthest divide to the outlet in km, and is the average (dimensionless) slope, that is the ratio of the fall of the main channel from the divide to the outlet and its length. As an alternative for very small catchments, the time of concentration can also be taken as the time to equilibrium (6.20) obtained analytically by means of the kinematic wave method. For turbulent flow, identification of linear response functions with the Gauckler–Manning formula (5.41), one has and so that Equation (6.20) can be written as (cid:5) (cid:6) (n0.60P −0.40) It is remarkable that the powers of and are not very different from those in the strictly empirical formula (12.21). Note, however, the different conceptual origins of Equations(12.21)and(12.22);theformerreferstothetimerequiredbythefluidparticles to travel the length of the drainage area, whereas the latter refers to a wave motion, that is the time for the steady state signal to cover that same distance. Recall also that on the basis of experimental data on reported in the literature, McCuen and Spiess (1995) recommended that Equation (12.22) should not be used when ) exceeds Next, a decision must be made regarding the return period of the event . This is usuallytakenastheexpectedlifetimeofthestructure.Togiveanidea,ASCEandWPCF (1982) suggest, depending on the economic justification, typical values of 5 y for storm sewers in residential areas, 20 y in commercial and high value districts, and 50 y or more for flood protection works. Finally, with the duration of the rainfall event, i.e. D, and the return period of the design storm, i.e. , both decided upon, the intensity can be determined from the available intensity–frequency–duration data for the site. Figure 3.16 shows an example of such data. If deemed necessary, the rainfall intensity at the point can be converted to an area value by such means as illustrated in Figure 3.14. Thejustificationforequatingthetimeofconcentrationwiththedurationoftheselected design rainfall event is illustrated in Figure 12.9. This shows that, if it is assumed that , only part of the drainage area can contribute to the outflow. On the other hand, if one assumes that , the intensity obtained for this longer duration, would be too small; indeed, as illustrated in Figure 3.16, for a given return period , the rainfall rate decreases with increasing duration D. Thus to allow the entire drainage area to contribute to the outflow rate, and to obtain the maximal intensity for the selected return period, it is reasonable to put . variations in the engineering literature are based on the notion that storm runoff consists primarily of overland flow. As discussed in Chapter 11, on hillslopes with permeable soils, this is often a tenuous assumption, as most of the runoff takes place through subsurface flow paths. If for such situations Darcy’s law is valid, the kinematic flow speed (10.151) yields the following time of concentration ,k αareeffectivevalues inwhich isthehillslopelength(seeFigure10.26),andn and of the drainable porosity, the hydraulic conductivity and the slope angle, respectively. streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.9 Intheapplicaticationofthe rationalmethodtocalculatethe peakflow,thedurationofthe designstormistakenasthetimeof D tc.Ifthe concentration,or durationwereshorter,sothat D tc,onlypartofthecatchment wouldcontributetotherunoff;on theotherhandifalongerduration D tc,the wereassumed,sothat designrainfallrate,derivedfrom availableintensity–duration information(e.g.Figure3.16), mightbetoosmallfortheadopted designreturnperiod Linear translation with the time–area method The rational method provides only the peak discharge rate, and over the years attempts have been made to broaden the approach, in order to allow a more complete description of the entire hydrograph including its rise and subsequent recession. This was done, for instance by Hawken and Ross (1921), who considered the effects of the drainage area shape and of the time variation of the storm rainfall. The effects of the shape of the drainageareaandofthedrainagenetwereaccountedforbytheintroductionofthetime– ofthetraveltimesinthebasintotheoutlet.Thisfunctionisobtainedbyfirstestablishing atraveltimeforeachpointinthebasin,andbythensketchingisochrones,whicharelines connectingpointsofequaltraveltime.Thetime–areafunction (t)isaplotofthe relative areas (as fractions of the total basin area) between different isochrones (equally spaced in time), against their respective travel times; thus it is the density function of the travel times to the outlet (Figure 12.10). In this approach, the time variation of the rainfall input was accounted for by a procedure, which, as pointed out by Nash (1958), was in fact a numerical convolution operation. Just like in the standard version of the Rational Method, the basic assumption is that the entire catchment is equivalent with a plane on which the rainfall is transported to the outlet by translation. Because the system is linear, the transformation mechanism is that of a linear kinematic channel as formulated in Chapter 5. Since it is normalized, identification of linear response functions Ar Ar(t),asan Fig.12.10 Sketchofatime–areafunction extensionoftherationalmethod.Thedashed linesonthecatchmentmaprepresentlinesof equaltraveltimeorisochrones.

Hence, the time–area function (t) is the unit response function of this type of catchment (see Figure 12.11), and the outflow resulting from a rainfall input x(t) is given by Equation (12.2), or = x(τ) − τ)dτ y(t) (t (12.24) Note with Dooge (1973) that, while this approach made use of an instantaneous unit hydrograph in the form of the time–area function, it predated the formal invention of the unit hydrograph by Sherman (1932a,b) by about a decade. But the time–area approach never gained wide acceptance, probably because it takes insufficient account of storage mechanisms in the basin. In natural drainage basins precipitation cannot be immediately translated to the outlet, but a portion of it first must build up some water as storage on the vegetation and on the soil surface and in the pores of the soil profile, before any flow can take place. Therefore, it can be expected that, when the travel times in a basin are estimated on the basis of known velocities of overland flows and channel flows, the calculated peak outflow rates will tend to be severely overestimated. This realization led to increased efforts to include storage effects in subsequent developments. In recent years the concept of translation, underlying the time–area–concentration function, has continued to be studied and used in a more formal way. This is done by streamflow response at the catchment scale Widthfunctionw w(s+) Fig.12.12 forthechannelnetwork showninFigure11.1.Inthis case,thevariables+ topologicaldistancefromthe outletofthecatchment, scaledwiththelongest (topological)streamlength fromtheoutlet. 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 w = w(s); means of what is now usually called (see Kirkby, 1976) the width function this function can be defined as the density function of the channel flow distances in the catchment from the outlet, and it describes the (normalized) number of links, or channel segments, as a function of distance from the outlet. This distance variable hasvariouslybeentakenastheactualdistancealongthechannels,asgeometricdistance, that is the piecewise straight line joining junctions, or as the number of links, that is the in large networks the longest topological distances differ only slightly from the longest geometricaldistances.)Thenumberoflinksisstronglyrelatedwithbasinarea;moreover, average stream velocities are known (Wolman, 1955; Pilgrim, 1977; Rodriguez-Iturbe al., 1992) to remain relatively constant in the downstream direction, in spite of the decreasing slopes. Therefore, as the distances from the outlet can be taken to be roughly proportional to the travel times, the width function concept is essentially equivalent with the time–area function. However, because the width function is based on well-defined morphologicalcharacteristicsoftherivernetwork,itcanbedeterminedmoreobjectively and is therefore better suited for analysis. The correspondence between this concept and the time–area function as a unit response function was probably first pointed out by Surkan (1969), who used it to study the effect of stream channel pattern on the flow at theoutletofthebasin.Subsequently,thewidthfunctionhasprovedtobeausefultoolfor studyingthestochasticpropertiesofstreamnetworks(seeKirkby,1976;Venezianoetal., 2000) and implicitly some of their translatory response characteristics (see Gupta and Example 12.5.

The results are shown in Figure 12.12. identification of linear response functions Linear translation in series with one linear storage element The transformation of a rainfall input hyetograph into a streamflow output hydrograph involves both a delay as a result of translatory effects and a deformation and attenuation as a result of storage effects. In a linear context, the simplest way of incorporating both effects is simply to add them. Thus it stands to reason that historically the next step in the development of linear runoff routing procedures consisted of the superposition of a linear time–area function, representing pure translation, with a linear reservoir, representing pure storage. In one of the better known implementations of this idea, Clark (1945) derived the instantaneous unit hydrograph from streamflow records by numerically routing the time–area concentration function of the basin through a single concentrated storage element by means of the Muskingum method with 0. Hence, in light of Equation (7.15), this type of storage element is characterized by where is the outflow rate, and the storage, both per unit catchment area, so that storage coefficient. A similar approach was also applied successfully in the development of large-scale drainage schemes in a number of Irish catchments by O’Kelly (1955) and his fellow engineers at the Office of Public Works. However, in the early stages of this work it became clear that the routing through the concentrated storage element had such a smoothingeffectonthetime–areafunction,thattheexactshapeofthetime–areafunction was not very critical, and that there was little loss in accuracy when it was replaced by an isosceles triangle. The main parameters in the applications of this concept were the time of concentration , which is the time base needed to scale the triangular time–area function, and the storage coefficient K, or the delay, in the routing procedure by means of Equation (12.25). O’Kelly’s report is noteworthy and it suggests that in many studies the importance of the time–area function, and of the width function, may have been exaggerated. Variousprocedureshavebeenusedinthepasttoestimatethetwoparameterst and K. In Clark’s (1945) application, it was assumed that the direct effect of the rainfall ceases attheinflectionpointoftherecessionlimboftheoutflowhydrograph,andthat,fromthat time on, the outflow is merely a release from storage in the basin; accordingly he took as the time between the end of rainfall and the inflection point of the falling leg of the hydrograph, and the storage coefficient from the recession after the inflection point with 0. In the procedure described by O’Kelly (1955) the shape of the instantaneous unit hydrograph is uniquely determined by the ratio (see also Example 12.6); thus the general shape of the experimentally obtained unit hydrographs for the basin provided an estimate of this ratio, which allowed then in turn the estimation of the value of (or K) by matching the peak outflow rates. Because the shapes could not always be fitted well, often various ratios were tried yielding different and values. A review of some of the earlier methods to estimate these parameters has been presented by Dooge (1973, pp. 198–200). In several of these studies and were expressed in streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.13 Alineartranslationelementplacedinserieswithalineartankelement,asamechanisticmetaphorfor therunoffderivedbysuccessiveconvolution(orrouting)oftheinstantaneousinputδ(t)througha time–area(orwidth)functionandthroughaconcentratedstoragefunction. terms of powers of basin characteristics, such as and A. Note that both (12.21) and (12.22) suggest that should be proportional to a power of the combined variable To derive the unit response function of this model, it is necessary to consider first the unitresponseofaconcentratedstorageelement.Theflowthroughalinearstorageelement After substitution of the concentrated storage function (12.25), this can be rearranged as (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(t/K), which, upon multiplication of both sides by yields the solution exp(−t/K) constant (12.27) With a delta function input, that is x(t) the output of (12.27) is the unit response function for a single storage element; in light of (A7) this has the form exp(−t/K) u(t) (12.28) As could be expected, this is the same as the Muskingum response function (7.28) for the storm runoff is derived by successively routing the rainfall input through trans- lation and storage, can thus be formulated by simply putting (t) in sequence with becomes the input into the storage element, whose unit response is (12.28). This is illustrated in Figure 12.13. The routing is accomplished by a convolution operation, which produces immediately the unit response function of this combined system, u(t) (t (12.29) identification of linear response functions Fig.12.14 Unitresponsefunctionresultingfromatime–areafunctionwiththeshapeofanisoscelestriangle K/tc.Both routedthroughalinearstorageelementfordifferentvaluesofthetime-scaleratio u(t)andt aremadedimensionlesswithtc.Thetimescaletc isthetimeofconcentrationofthe time–areafunction(dashedline)andthetimescale isthecoefficientofthelinearstorageelement. Example 12.6 Consider a hypothetical diamond-shaped catchment with the stream channel running along one of the diagonals; in the present context this produces a triangular time–area function (or width function), which can be formulated as follows = ≤ ≤ /2 = + /2 < ≤ where is the time of concentration. Observe that the area under (t) equals unity, as it should. The unit response is calculated by applying (12.29) with (12.30). Thus, one has for −(t−τ)/Kdτ u(t) (12.31) which upon integration results in Similarly for , one can write = τe − τe + u(t) (12.33) streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.15 Sameasprevious figure,forthecaseof atime–areafunction K/t =0.1 withtheshapeofa right-angledtriangle (dashedline). which yields (cid:5) (cid:6) u(t) 1 (12.34) ItcanbereadilycheckedthatEquations(12.32)and(12.34)yieldthesamevalueforu at as they should.

The resulting instantaneous unit hydrograph, obtained by patching (12.32), (12.34) and (12.35) together over their respective time ranges, is shown in Figure 12.14. In principle, it should be possible to use this three-component unit response function with any input function x(t) in the convolution integral (12.2), to calculate the actual involved, so that in practical applications it may be more convenient to convert u(t) into tabularformandcarryoutthecalculationsnumerically.Anideaoftheeffectoftheshape of the time–area function on the resulting unit response can be gained by comparing this result with the response function obtained with a right-angled triangle shown in Figure 12.15.

For instance, Figure 12.16 shows the arrangement used to describe flood flows of the Kitakami River in northern Honshu; the basin was represented by two elements in = = 2.9h parallel, one with 33h that receives 60% of the input, and one with that receives 35% of the input; 5% of the total input and 20 mm of the initial input into the fast response tank were assumed to be “lost.” Unlike in flood flows, in the description of daily flows, interflow and baseflow are more important; to simulate these, a differ- ent arrangement was used, which is illustrated in Figure 12.17. Initially after a drought period, precipitation flows out of the first tank into groundwater storage, from which the water flows out as baseflow. Only after the first tank has become full, does the overflow into the second tank result in subsurface stormflow runoff. Several arrangements were also proposed by Sugawara and Maruyama (1956) to accommodate spatial variation of theinputcharacteristicsofthebasin.Oneoftheseisconsideredinthefollowingexample. Example 12.7. Tank model allowing for spatial variability Figure 12.18 illustrates an arrangement by which each storage element represents a subarea of the basin. Thus each tank receives as input the output from the upstream tank, in addition to the rainfall on the subarea it represents. Let and be the fractions of the total area represented by each tank. Then, for an input into the first tank given streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.18 ExampleofatankarrangementusedbySugawara andMaruyama(1956)toaccommodatespatial variabilityoftheinputoverthecatchmentarea,to derivetheunitresponseu u(t). multiplied by . Similarly, the unit response from the second tank can be calculated by routing the output from the first tank, i.e. (t), plus the instantaneous rainfall on the second subarea, i.e. through the tank representing this second subarea, (cid:9) (cid:10) = α + α δ(τ) dτ or (12.36) (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(−t/K) In the same way, one can show that the outflow from the third tank, resulting from an instantaneous input over the entire area, which is the unit response of the catchment, is given by (cid:11) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(−t/K) α = = + α + α In a similar approach, Nash (1957) assumed that the transformation of catchment input into streamflow output is equivalent with a succession of routings through a series of linear storage elements; thus, the input enters the first tank and is then successively routed through the second, the third, and so on (see Figure 12.19). The unit response of the Nash cascade, as it is sometimes called, can be derived as follows. The input of an instantaneous rainfall of unit volume produces an output given by Equation (12.28). identification of linear response functions Fig.12.19 Thetankcascade,proposedbyNash (1957),consistingofnequalstorage elementsplacedinseries,asametaphor fortheresponseu u(t)ofacatchment toaninstantaneousinput When this is taken as input into the second storage element, the output from that second storage is (t) (12.38) This, in turn, is input into the third storage element and produces an output (t) (12.39) The same process can be continued to obtain the outflow from the last storage element, (t/K)n−1 exp(−t/K) (t) (12.40) whichistheresponsefunctionoftheentiresystem.Inordertoallowtheuseoffractional values of n, the factorial can be replaced by the complete gamma function. Finally, the unit response of the entire catchment can be written as (t/K)n−1 exp(−t/K) u(t) (12.41) K(cid:8)(n) Equation (12.41) is known as the integrand of the incomplete gamma function or as the gamma density function. It has only two parameters, but it is quite flexible as it can accommodate a wide variety of hydrograph shapes; as illustrated in Figure 12.20, can be considered a scale parameter and a shape parameter. Equation (12.41) has been applied widely in watershed hydrology to parameterize unit hydrographs in terms of drainage basin characteristics. streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.20 Theunitresponse function,obtained withthegamma densityfunction (12.40)or(12.41)as u(t/K),for differentvaluesofthe parametern. For example, Nash (1960) used Equation (12.41) to determine the instantaneous unit hydrographs for a number of British catchments by means of the method of moments. It can readily be shown (cf. Equation (13.9)) that its first moment about the origin is and that its second moment about the mean, or center of gravity (cf. Equations (13.10) and (13.12)), is Note that with 1 and 0 these are the same as Equations (7.31) and (7.34) for the Muskingum formulation. Because the moments of u(t) can be calculated from available rainfall and streamflow records by means of the theorem of moments, as given directly with relevant basin characteristics; in this case, these were found to be drainage area, mean slope and length of the main channel. A similar study was carried out by Wu (1963) with catchments in Indiana. Actually, prior to its conceptual derivation by Nash, the incomplete gamma function had already been used by Edson (1951) on different grounds, to describe finite duration unit hydrographs. It was subsequently also used for this purpose by Gray (1961). Several features of the tank cascade may help to explain, perhaps, why the inte- grand of the incomplete gamma function has been used so widely in applied hydrology. First, consider the case where is allowed to increase indefinitely. As indicated by Equation (12.42), the center of gravity of the flood wave will then occur at a finite value of the time t, only if the storage coefficient of each tank in the cascade, K, is made to become very small. But if is made to become very small, the second moment (12.43) indicates that the duration of the flood wave will become very short. At the same time, if theareaunderthewavecurveistomaintainamagnitudeofone,themagnitudeofthepeak mustbecomeverylarge.ThisisillustratedinFigure12.21,forthecasenK 1.Thus,in → ∞, → 0, the extreme case of but finite nK, the unit response function (12.41) identification of linear response functions (12.41)(i.e.thegammadensityfunction)approachesadeltafunctionasn Fig.12.21 Theunitresponsefunction becomesverylarge.Thecurvesshownareforn= 2,5,10,20,40,80and120.Toalloweasy comparisonbetweenthedifferentcurvesasnincreases,theircentersofgravity,i.e.thefirstmoments = = 1/ninEquation(12.41). (12.42),aremaintainedatt K 1byputting should be recalled that the delta function is also the unit response function of the linear kinematic channel, as formulated in Equation (5.124). This means that a tank cascade consisting of a finite number of storage elements is in fact intermediate between two and that Equation (12.41) provides some weighted average of both effects. Put differently, a finite set of storage elements is capable of accommodating not only storage effects but also the translatory effects of the hillslopes and of the channel network in the catchment. A second feature is that, while Equation (12.41) is derived for a cascade consisting of storage elements with the same value of the storage coefficient K, this result is not very sensitive to this restriction. The following example illustrates this. Example 12.8. Cascade with unequal storage elements In the case of 2 tanks, each with a different value of the storage coefficient, namely and , instead of Equation (12.38), the unit response function becomes or, upon integration, (t) (12.44) streamflow response at the catchment scale Ku(t/K)ofacascadeofthreestorageelements(1)with Fig.12.22 Dimensionlessunitresponsefunction K,asgivenbyEquation(12.41)withn equalstoragecoefficients 3orEquation(12.39),(2)with = = 0.75K = 1.5K,and K1 K2 K3 unequalstoragecoefficients,namelyEquation (12.45)with and = 0.4,K2 = 1.0K (3)withunequalstoragecoefficients,namelyEquation (12.45)with and Inthesameway,forn 3tanks,withthreedifferentstoragecoefficients and , instead of Equation (12.39), one obtains the following expression 1 1 3 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 3 This process can be continued for any number of tanks. For 3 as an example, Figure 12.22 shows a comparison between Equations (12.39) and (12.45) with and also with K, the main K K K K K 2 3 1 2 3 point is that the difference between these response functions is not very large, because the total lag time, that is the first moment has been kept the same in all three cases, such that 3K (cf. Equation (12.42)). The agreement would have been even better, if also the second moment had been kept the same in all three cases. This calculation illustrates why the passage of rain water through a succession of storage elements, such as interception and detention, soil moisture and groundwater, overland and channel flows, may still be described reasonably well by Equation (12.41), even though each one of these storage elements may have a different storage coefficient K. Stochastic interpretations Several of the above response functions, as combinations of storage tanks with or with- out linear channels, have been used with good results in the solution of a number of engineering problems. In some of these studies of specific catchment situations, ad hoc empirical relationships were derived for the parameters in these runoff representations. stationary nonlinear lumped response However, because no direct link could be established between the parameters and the physical mechanisms in the catchment, like any other unit hydrograph they suffer from a lackofgeneralityandtheymustalwaysbecalibratedtobeofanyuse.Forthisreasonthe quest has continued for better formulations of the catchment scale processes involved in the transformation of precipitation into runoff. One of the more active lines of endeavor has made use of stochastic concepts to describe the instantaneous unit hydrograph as the distribution of the arrival times of water at the catchment outlet. These approaches have typically consisted of linear rout- ing of precipitation through topologically random channel networks with various prob- ability distributions for the channel segments and with different assumptions regarding the holding time or travel time distributions of the water in the channel segments. As different concepts have matured, the width function has gradually emerged as the tool of choice to describe the structure of the channel network (Snell and Sivapalan, 1994; Marani al., 1994; Veneziano al., 2000), and has replaced earlier methods based on Horton–Strahler stream ordering (see Figure 11.1) and the resulting order ratios. Simi- larly, different attempts have been made to improve the formulation of the holding times from exponential distributions (Rodriguez-Iturbe and Valdes, 1979; Gupta al., 1980) to more realistic response functions, such as obtained from the complete linear solution The inclusion of hillslope outflows into the channel network has also been explored (see VanderTak and Bras, 1990; Robinson al., 1995) with different hillslope response functions. Note that the assumption of an exponential distribution of residence times in a channel segment is equivalent with the assumption of a linear storage element as formulated by Equation (12.28). An overview of advances in this stochastic approach has been presented by Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo (1997). With the growing complexity of such representations and the increasing number of the required parameters, these approaches are gradually evolving into direct simulation models; however, in the process the appeal of parsimony of the unit hydrograph is being lost,whileitsmainlimitations,namelylinearityandtimeinvariancearebeingkept.Also, although the description of the channel network is becoming increasingly realistic, the simulation of some critical processes at the catchment scale, involving the inclusion of hillslope mechanisms, with such thorny aspects as preferential flow and simultaneous transport of new and old water (see Chapter 11), has not received much attention so far; its inclusion in linear theory remains an elusive goal and will require more research."}
{"text": "12.3 STATIONARY NONLINEAR LUMPED RESPONSE It is generally recognized that the transformation of precipitation and other inputs into streamflow can be quite nonlinear and non-stationary, so that the unit hydrograph is not always the proper method of approaching this problem. This is especially true in the case of extreme deviations, such as catastrophic floods, when rainfall–runoff systems tend to exhibit considerable nonlinearities, as manifested by the fact that runoff fails streamflow response at the catchment scale to be simply proportional to precipitation intensity. Over the past few decades various attempts have been made to incorporate nonlinearities in response formulations at the catchment scale. These can be subdivided into two broad categories, which are briefly considered in this section."}

In most of these studies one of the conclusions was that the nonlinear formulation is better able to simulate rainfall–runoff behavior of catchment areas than linear methods.

{"text": "12.3.2 Nonlinear runoff routing This method of transforming rainfall into basin streamflow has mostly made use of concentrated storage elements, and is therefore also referred to as storage routing. In most cases the nonlinear storage function was assumed to be of the power type, m((cid:7)= where and 1) are adjustable parameters; in this form the storage function can be considered a generalization of Equation (12.25). After substitution of (12.48) in the In what follows a few examples are presented of past attempts to include this type of nonlinearity in the catchment response behavior. Horton (1941) was the first to use this approach; he proposed that flood hydrographs can be considered the result of a triangular “virtual channel inflow graph” produced by rainfall on the adjoining land, which is then routed through nonlinear channel storage by means of Equation (12.49). Horton (1936; 1937) estimated the parameters of the storage function (12.48) from quasi-steady open channel flow considerations. From analysis of a large number of flood events on different rivers, he showed that during a recession the channel storage behaves nearly the same as if the entire volume were concentrated in a single reservoir; but during rising stages it behaves as a reservoir of somewhat streamflow response at the catchment scale larger capacity. He reasoned by means of the GM equation (5.41) that should lie around for channels with a rectangular section, and around for channels with a triangular section; although there was some scatter, an analysis of river recession flow data (cf. Equation (12.54)) confirmed that was mostly between 0.6 and 0.8. Interestingly, although it was nonlinear, Horton’s approach provided the impetus for Section 12.2.2. Asecondtypeofnonlinearrunoffmodel,whichhasbeenusedinanumberofstudies, consists of arrays of nonlinear storage elements, like Equation (12.48), in series and in parallel representing different components of the basin; the storage arrays are usually structured in the same arrangement as the actual stream channel network. Such arrays can be considered nonlinear analogs of the linear ones, examples of which are shown in Figures 12.16–12.19. One such routing procedure was described by Rockwood (1958), who used it to forecast streamflow in the entire Columbia River Basin on the basis of preceding streamflows and forecasts of basin inputs from snowmelt and rainfall. This large basin was assumed to consist of a number of subbasins, lakes and stream channels. Each subbasin was assumed to consist of two nonlinear storage elements in seriesrepresentingsurfacerunoff,whichareplacedinparallelwithtwostorageelements in series representing subsurface runoff. Channel segments, mostly between 30 and 80 km long, were represented by three nonlinear storage elements in series. The routing procedure consisted essentially of the numerical solution of Equation (12.49) for each storage element, in which it was assumed that and was derived by trial routings. Different arrays of nonlinear storage elements, each representing a subarea and each receiving the excess rainfall input on that subarea plus the outflow from the upstream storage elements, were devised by Laurenson (1964) and subsequently by Mein al. (1974) to simulate storm flows from catchments in Australia. In this approach the catch- ment area is first subdivided in a number of approximately equal subareas along the major tributaries, and a nonlinear tank is then located at the center of gravity of each of the subareas and assigned a relative lag time of that location. At first this relative lag – or storage delay – time was assumed to be proportional to ), where and are the length and slope of the reach through the subarea, and the summation was carried out from the location of the subarea to the outlet; however, it was subsequently found that putting it proportional to the distance from the outlet, i.e. L, yielded the same results; this shows that the effects of slope, flow depth and surface roughness become irrelevant in this type of idealization. The parameter was estimated by observing from comparison of (12.25) with (12.48) that Then in accordance with Equation (7.19), logarithmic regression was carried out for a number of storms between the time from the centroid of the excess rain to that of (cid:8)y(cid:9); the storm runoff and the average storm runoff during the event, the slopes of the Askew,1970)arangeofroughly0.60 ≤ ≤ 0.81.Thesevaluesareverysimilartothose stationary nonlinear lumped response could be used as a typical value. As indicated in Equation (12.50), is proportional to the time of travel; accordingly, this parameter was estimated by putting in which was taken to be the value of the relative travel time through the subarea represented by that particular storage tank, i.e. ) or mentioned earlier. With and known, remained as the only unknown parameter of the model; this was estimated by trial-and-error routings with available data. A more optimal estimation of theparametersinthismodelwassubsequentlydevelopedbyKuczera(1990)andKuczera and Williams (1992). A similar nonlinear storage routing procedure was developed by (or lag) was made to depend also on the area represented by the storage element, aAbym−1; = = 0.57 namely as in their case the constants were taken as and the slightly different value Physical justification of nonlinear tanks In the past, the nonlinear storage relationship (12.48) has been justified on physical grounds,mostlybyconsideringopenchannelstorage.Theargumentusuallyfollowsthat originally developed by Horton (1936; 1937), based on a lumped kinematic analysis for quasi-steady, quasi-uniform flow. Thus the volume of water stored in a channel reach of length is assumed to be given by L, in which is the average cross-sectional area in the reach. The channel is assumed to be wide enough, so that the hydraulic radius equals the mean water depth, or h, and the cross-sectional area of the channel equals the depth times the width, or . For steady uniform conditions, (5.39) (or (5.43)) produces then the outflow rate from the reach as the channel storage is in terms of the outflow from the reach (cid:7) (cid:8) Q1/(a+1) in which and are the parameters in the open channel equation (5.39). Hence, if it is assumed that all the storm runoff water in the catchment is stored in the stream channels, so that one has (cid:7) (cid:8) y1/(a+1) inwhich,asbefore, isnowthelengthofallstreamchannelsinthecatchment upstream from the point where is determined, and in which the other variables are assumed to be averages over the catchment area A. This result is in the form of (12.48), = + = 0.60 = 0.67 with (a for the GM equation, and for the Ch´ ezy equation. But this derivation of Equation (12.53) is not wholly convincing, first, because obvi- ously not all the storm runoff water is stored in channels, and second, because it is well known that a major part of most storm flows is generated by subsurface runoff, as explained in Chapter 11. Some estimate of groundwater storage can be obtained streamflow response at the catchment scale by considering unconfined flow under the hydraulic assumption.

If the system can be linearized, the solution is given by (10.113) and after longer times by (10.116). Integration of Equation (12.54) with the latter produces in the same way expected for a linear system. In summary, most of the values from field data reviewed here not only conform with the values expected for open channels, but they appear to be intermediate between the values for nonlinear and linear groundwater aquifers as well."}
{"text": "12.4 NON-STATIONARY LINEAR RESPONSE In the definition of the unit hydrograph the two stipulated assumptions are linearity and time invariance. Until now, these two assumptions have mainly been studied separately, andtheircombinedeffecthasnotyetbeenfullyexplored.Theincorporationofnonlinear effects into stationary systems, which is treated in Section 12.3, seems to have received more attention in the literature and relatively few studies have been devoted to nonsta- tionary effects on linear catchment response. Yet, several experimental investigations reviewed in Chapter 11 have indicated that, for instance, the ratio of old and new water in the catchment outflow is affected not only by the intensity of the rain, but also by such factors as seasonal moisture status and the time since the start of the rain. Hence, as the catchment contains more or less water, different flow paths and mechanisms come into play in the production of the runoff, and this results in a non-stationary response. In general, one can distinguish two ways of describing non-stationarity. One type of formulation makes use of a coarse time variable describing changes in catchment responseatmonthlyandannualtimescales;thesechangescouldconceivablybecyclical, that is seasonal, or in the nature of a trend in the case of changes in land use or climate. non-stationary linear response The second type of approach uses a finer time variable to describe response changes during the event itself, as a result of physical changes inside the catchment resulting from continued rain, snowmelt or flooding. These two types can be combined formally in a convolution integral, as an extension of Equation (12.2), namely y(t) (12.57) u(χ,τ,t − τ) stationary case of Equation (12.2), here the unit response is a function of three time variables; the first variable is the coarse time scale in terms of months, seasonsoryears.Thesecond,τ,isthedummyvariableofintegration,suchthat0 ≤ τ ≤ however, as argument in the unit response, it denotes the time of the input and thus specifies the response for the input at that time. The third, t, is the time for which − τ) x(τ). the output is to be determined and (t is the time elapsed since the input The convolution operation of Equation (12.57) describes superposition, which is the essence of linearity. However, as pointed out by Diskin and Boneh (1974), in contrast to the stationary case, here the convolution (or superposition) operation is generally not commutable. This means, for example, that two non-stationary systems connected in series, say A followed by B, will produce a different output when their order is reversed, B followed by A. Forthefirsttypeofnon-stationaritytheunitresponseinEquation(12.57)dependsonly year.Thismeansthatduringtheinputeventtheresponsecanbeconsideredstationary,and the concepts discussed in Sections 12.1 and 12.2 are applicable. Therefore, the second type is the one usually considered, when time variance effects are to be included. In this case, the unit response depends only on and (t and (12.57) can be simplified to y(t) (12.58) This is illustrated in Figure 12.24. In discrete form (cf. Equation (12.9)) this can be written as or alternatively (cf. Equation (12.10)), as i−k+1 i−k+1,k where the first subscript of the response function refers to the time of the input, and the second indicates its role in the numerical convolution. In several applications of the nonstationary linear approach in the past, the form of the unit response function has been assumed a priori. For example, Snyder (1970) derived the catchment response by routing, what was essentially a time–area diagram through a linear storage element with time-dependent storage coefficient streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.24 Illustrationoftheconvolution (cid:13) = x(τ)u(τ,t operation withanonstationaryunitresponse = u(τ,t).(Thevaluesof u y anduare notdrawntoscale.)Thevariablet denotesthetimeforwhichtherunoff iscalculatedandτ isthetimesincethe startoftheprecipitationinput unitresponse,whichisshownatonly threeinstantsoftimeτ,continually changesitsshapeastheprecipitation continues.Comparethiswiththe stationarycaseofFigure12.6. ered different combinations of time-variant linear channel and time-variant linear stor- age elements, one among them being a cascade of equal storage elements. Diskin and Boneh (1974) developed numerical least squares procedures to derive more general, i.e. not with a preconceived mathematical form, response functions , as shown in probablytheonlyonethatconsideredbothfine-scaleandcoarse-scalenon-stationarityas formulated in Equation (12.57).

The approach was later extended by Chiu and Huang (1970) to include nonlinear effects by replacing (12.25) by its nonlinear analog (12.48). references REFERENCES Amorocho, J. and Brandstetter, A.

{"text": "13.1 RANDOM VARIABLES AND PROBABILITY Inpracticalterms,arandomvariablemaybedefinedasthemagnitudeofanevent,which is the outcome of an experiment; the variable is called random because this magnitude cannot be predicted with certainty. Random variables can be classified as discrete or as continuous, or sometimes as a combination of the two. When an event occurs times in an experiment, that is carried out times, its relative frequency is the ratio (n The probability of this event can then be defined as the limit of its relative frequency, when is allowed to increase indefinitely, or P(A) lim (13.1) To be sure, this definition is intuitively appealing, as it gives a “feel” for the meaning of probability in everyday life. However, in any physical experiment the number can only be finite, so that this limit is only a hypothesis. For this reason, the probability of an event is preferably defined axiomatically (Papoulis, 1965), as a number linked to (ii)theprobabilityofallpossibleoutcomes,i.e.theprobabilityofcertainty,equalsunity; (iii)if and aremutuallyexclusiveevents,theprobabilityof or occurringequals definition (13.1) satisfies these axioms. In this sense, the word usually relative frequency refers to the empirical probability, that is the probability estimated from a finite sample, which is presumably drawn from an infinitely large population.

A rod graph is a natural way to represent the distribution of the probabilities as relative frequencies of a discrete variable (see Figure 13.1). A random variable is called continuous when it can assume any value in a certain range of real numbers, which may or may not be unbounded.

{"text": "13.2.3 Return period The reciprocal of the probability that a certain value will be exceeded is referred to as the period, also called the recurrence interval or the exceedance interval, or (x) (13.15) This return period is the expected number of observations required until is exceeded This can readily be shown as follows. Let F(x)) denote the probability that, at any trial in an experiment, the magnitude of the event will not be larger than x; then, the probability, that this magnitude will not be exceeded in the first (k 1) trials and finally will be exceeded in the last trial, is given by P{k > x} = − trials until p) (13.16) This probability function is known as the geometric distribution (see Section 13.3.1 below).

The term “return period” stems from the fact that, whenever the observations are made at regular intervals in time, the number of observations is a time expressed in the same units. It should be emphasized that the return period represents the average number of observations. This does not mean that the event will occur once every number of observations. Thus a 100 y flood need not occur every 100 y. In fact, it may very well occur next year, or again, it may not occur at all for another 1000 y, although that is unlikely. In practical applications, the return period as given by Equation (13.15) is normally used to characterize phenomena whose severity increases with their magnitude x. For example,a500yfloodismoresevereandcausesmoredamagethana100yevent.When, on the other hand, the severity of the event decreases with its numerical magnitude, the return period should be defined as (x) (13.18) This will ensure that, for instance in the case of a drought, lower flows and lower rainfall amounts,asmeasuresofdroughtseverity,willbecharacterizedbylongerreturnperiods."}
{"text": "13.2.4 Empirical probability plots It is often useful to plot the data from a hydrologic measurement record to gain a general idea of their statistical characteristics. The (empirical) probability plot, also known as the frequency plot or frequency curve, and sometimes as the quantile plot, is a common tool for this purpose. This plot is a graphical representation of the probability (of non- exceedance or exceedance) of the individual data in the record against their respective magnitudes, i.e. F(x). For a data record, consisting of items, normally measured at regular intervals, the procedure is as follows. (i) Tabulate the data, , ranked in increasing magnitude, so that ; (ii) assign an order number to each item, in 1,2,...,m ,...,n accordance with its respective subscript, namely ; (iii) estimate the (empirical) probabilityP , that the magnitude of the item will not be exceeded, for each itembymeansofasuitableplottingpositionformula.Thisplottingposition isusedas an estimate of the value of the unknown probability F(x ) for the observed event . In the past numerous plotting position formulae have been suggested. Cunnane (1978) has presented a critical review of the history and properties of some of the more common ones. Plotting position Probably the oldest and intuitively the simplest is The problem with this expression is that the largest item on record is assigned a probability of one, that is certainty;inotherwords,withthisformulaitisassumedthatthemagnitudeofthelargest will never be exceeded in the future. Because this is impossible, the use of this plotting position is tantamount to discarding the largest item in the record. This difficulty may be summary descriptors of a probability distribution function = − 1)/n,butthisyieldscertaintyforthesmallestitemin avoidedbytheformula (m = − 1/2)/n. therecord.Hazen(1930)proposedanintermediateposition,namely (m An obvious feature of Hazen’s choice is that with Equation (13.15) it produces a return period 2n for the largest item in the record; in other words, the resulting return period is twice as long as the period over which the data have been recorded. This is unacceptable, according to Gumbel (1958), because the estimated return period of the largest event should approach the length of the period of record, as becomes large. These difficulties are not encountered in the Weibull formula that beside the avoidance of difficulties for 0 or 1, so that all data can be plotted, it also has the following advantages: (i) it is independent of the distribution function F(x); (ii)thereturnperiodofthelargest(orsmallest,asthecasemaybe)observationapproaches the number of observations n; (iii) all observations are equally spaced on the frequency scale, which means that the difference between the plotting positions of the mth and the (m 1)th observation is a function only of n; (iv) it is intuitively simple and can be readily implemented.Its mainadvantage, however, is that itcan be theoreticallyjustified as the mean of the probability of the mth smallest observation; this can be proved as follows. Derivation of Weibull plotting position Consider again a sample of observations, after they have been ranked in increasing magnitude, so that . The probability distribution of the mth smallest observation by itself is given by Equation (13.3), or and the density of this observation by itself is (X ) (13.21) However, doesnotoccurbyitself,butinconjunctionwith(n 1)otherobservations; and (m 1) do not. The probability of this occurrence is given by the binomial distribution (see Section 13.3.2 below), and equals Fm−1 )n−m in which the symbol F(X ) is introduced for conciseness of notation, and “success” refers to non-exceedance. The probabilities of each observation are inde- pendent. Moreover, the mth smallest observation, , can occupy different places in the sequence of the remaining (n 1) observations, namely in front of all of them and elements of frequency analysis in hydrology behind each one of them. Hence the density function of the mth smallest observation ,occurringinconjunctionwiththeoccurrenceoftheremaining(n 1)observations, is equal to times the probability given by (13.22), multiplied by the density of by itself (Equation (13.21)), or Fm−1 )n−m if has a density function (y), then the density function of is given by (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) Applyingthistothepresentcasebyputting and ,oneobtainsthedensity function of (X ) from (13.23), namely Fm−1 )n−m g(F ) (1 (13.25) The mean of is the first moment, or, since 0 1, inwhich isadummyvariableofintegration.Theintegralinthisexpressionisacomplete betafunction,whichcanbeexpressedintermsoffactorials(e.g.AbramowitzandStegun, proves that the assumed plotting position of Equation (13.19) is in fact the mean of the probability of non-exceedance of the mth observation, that is .

To facilitate interpretation of the plotted dataandinterpolation,itisdesirabletoeliminateorreducethiscurvaturebystretchingor shrinking the scale in the appropriate range of values of , so that the points plot more nearly along a straight line. A common way to accomplish this is the use of probability paper. Hazen (1914b) appears to have been the first to advocate the use of probability paper in hydrology. Probability graph paper, for any given probability function F(x), is designed in such a way that, when that function or the corresponding return period (x) is plotted against x, one obtains a straight line. The most common types of probability paper involve a probability function with two parameters, say and b, whose values depend on the data summary descriptors of a probability distribution function under consideration; thus to make the probability paper generally applicable to any data set it is necessary to eliminate the dependency on these parameters. This can be done with a linear transformation of the type a(x b) (13.27) in which the nature of and depends on the particular function F(x) that is being used. For instance, in the case of the normal distribution one has and the case of the first asymptote for largest values, as will be seen below, is the mode, that is the value of where the density (x) is a maximum, and This transformation results in a distribution function, say (y), given by = + y/a) (y) F(b (13.28) whichisindependentoftheparameters.Inprinciple,probabilitypaperisconstructedasa plotof versus y,withthevaluesofa and leftunspecified;when F(x)issymmetrical, 0 is placed at the center of the scale. Parallel to the y-scale, a (y)-scale is plotted and in some types of probability paper a third scale is shown with (1 values. However, most types of probability paper do not show the y-scale, and only is based on the normal probability distribution, has been made available commercially in the past, nowadays normal scales can be generated by standard computer programs. For some applications, the x-variable is transformed logarithmically, so that it is log(x) which is plotted against (y) or (y). Figures 10.34–10.37 illustrate applications of lognormal probability paper. Example 13.1.

The same is done for selected values covering the entire range of interest. As mentioned, on most types of probability paper not all three axes are shown, but only the resulting F- or -axis.

{"text": "13.3.1 The geometric distribution This distribution was already discussed briefly in connection with the return period. For convenience,thereasoningcanbebrieflyrepeatedhere.Consideranexperimentinwhich there are two possible outcomes, namely success with a probability p, and failure with a probability (1 p). If the trials are independent of one another, then it follows that the probability that (k 1) successes will be followed by one failure is given by Equation (13.16), or as formulated here P{k failure} = − trials until first p) (13.29) Equation (13.29) can be used next, for example, to calculate the probability that it will take or fewer trials to incur failure. This is simply the sum of the probabilities, or if denotes the number of trials needed to experience failure, as a random variable, P{K ≤ k} = − p) (13.30) which yields immediately 1 It can also be seen that Equation (13.30) yields unity, that is certainty, when Actually, (13.30) could also have been obtained by considering first the probability that failure would not occur for trials; since the trials are independent, this is equal to Its complement is the probability that it will take or fewer trials for failure to occur. Example 13.2. Probability of exceedance of a flood of a given return period Assume that “success” means that the annual maximum flow in a river, also called the annual flood, does not exceed a given magnitude x, so that F(x). As an example, consider the event for which from Equation (13.15) it can be seen that this is a 50y flood. Figure 13.4 shows the probability, that it will take exactly years before that event is exceeded as a function of k, calculated with Equation (13.29). The probability thatitwillbeexceededthefirstyearis0.02.Theprobabilitythatitwillbeexceededafter 0.9849 × 0.02 = 0.00743. exactly 50 y is Figure 13.5 shows the probability calculated withEquation(13.30),thatitwilltakek orfeweryearstoexceedx,thatis,theprobability of the occurrence of a flood in excess of the same magnitude x. It can again be seen that the probability of this occurrence in the first year is 0.02; also, the probability that it will − 0.9850 = 0.636. be exceeded before 50 y have passed is 1 The probability approaches one as becomes large. Example 13.3. Probability of sequences of dry or rainy days The geometric distribution has been used by Hershfield (1970a, b; 1971) to study the probability of periods of a given length with or without precipitation. In this type of application pdenotestheconditionalprobabilityofasuccessbeingfollowedbyasuccess. elements of frequency analysis in hydrology Fig.13.4 Theprobability that anannualmaximum flowwithaknown probability = = 0.98,will beexceededafter exactlyk years.Thisis a50yeventandthe probabilitythatitwill beexceededafter50y is0.00743.(See Example13.2.) 0 20 40 60 801 Fig.13.5 Theprobability thatanannual maximumflowwith aknownprobability = = 0.98, willbeexceeded years.Thisisa50y eventandthe probabilitythatit willbeexceeded before50yhave passedis0.636.(See Equation(13.30)and 0 20 40 60 100 Example13.2.) In general, a success can refer to a day without rain, a day with rain, or some other desirable event, whatever the case may be. For the sake of illustration, let denote the probability that a day without rain be followed by a day without rain. In this case, the form of Equation (13.29) arises again as the simple product of the probabilities of a dry day being succeeded by a dry day for a sequence of days, multiplied by the probability of a dry kth day being succeeded by a rainy (k 1)th day; in other words, (13.29) represents the probability of experiencing a sequence of exactly dry This product in (13.29) involves the assumption that the events are independent, or which is the same, that remains constant and does not change with k, the duration of the period of dry days. Whether or not this is the case can be examined on the basis of the following considerations. In the present context, the probability that the dry period will last at most days is the sum of the probabilities of all dry periods shorter than some probability distributions for discrete variables 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Numbersofdrydaysequenceslastingatleastk+1days,plottedagainstthenumbersofsequences Fig.13.6 lastingatleastk days,asobservedovertheperiod1951–1960atPortland,Maine,onthebasisofthe analysisbyHershfield(1970a).Thedrydaysaredefinedforthreethresholdsofdailyprecipitation, namely 0.254mm(circles), valuesoftheslopesofthebest-fitstraightlinesthroughtheoriginare0.708,0.815and0.868;theseare nearlythesameastherespectivevaluesoftheconditionalprobabilities obtainedwiththemethodof moments,namely0.708,0.816and0.870.Forclarification,valuesofk areindicatednexttothepoints ofthesevenshortestdrydaysequenceswith 0.254mm(circles). or equal to days; this is given by Equation (13.30), which can readily be shown to yield 1 Conversely, the probability that a dry day sequence will last at least 1 days, that is, that it will be equal to or longer than 1 days, is the complement of (13.30), or Similarly, the probability that a dry day sequence will last at least days is Hence, the validity of the assumption, that is independent of k, can be readily examined empirically in any given situation by checking whether or not the ratio of the number of sequences, that last at least days, over the number of those that last at least (k 1) days is a constant for all k, or = const. wheretheconstantshouldinprinciplebeequalto p.Asanillustration,Figure13.6shows a plot of the numbers of dry day sequences against observed at Portland, Maine, over the period 1951–1960, on the basis of precipitation data analyzed by Hershfield less than a certain finite threshold; three such thresholds were considered, namely days with less than 0.254 mm, 2.54 mm and 6.35 mm. The slopes of the regression lines through the origin are 0.708, 0.815 and 0.868, respectively, which should be reasonable estimates of for each of these three thresholds. The more common way, however, to estimate the parameters is the method of moments. Because the geometric distribution (13.29) has only one parameter, viz. p, a knowledge of the mean of will suffice. The mean duration of a dry period is given by elements of frequency analysis in hydrology in which is the total number of dry days in the data record under considera- tion, and is the number of dry periods in the same record. As can be seen from Equation (13.17), this mean duration is also given by (1 which shows how can be determined immediately from the record by means of (13.32). The respective conditional probabilities of dry day sequences obtained this way with the data from Portland,Maine,onwhichFigure13.6isbased,werefoundtobe0.708,0.816and0.870 for the three thresholds; as was to be expected, these values are nearly the same as those obtained from the slopes of the lines through the points mentioned above. This example was presented for sequences of dry days, or rather days with precipita- tionlessthanacertainfinitethreshold.Thesamereasoningalsoholds,mutatismutandis, if represents the probability of a rainy day (i.e. in excess of a certain threshold) being succeeded by a rainy day. Finally, it should be kept in mind that p, as used here in this example, is different from the probability of a dry day; the latter is defined as the ratio of the number of dry days over the total number of days (dry and rainy) of the record. However, Hershfield (1970b) has shown how the two may be related."}
{"text": "13.3.2 The binomial distribution Consider again an experiment with two possible outcomes, namely success and failure, whose respective probabilities are and (1 p). This distribution provides the answer to the question what the probability is of successes and (n k) failures in trials. This question is similar to the one leading to the geometric distribution. Indeed, if the sequence of independent successes and failures were made to occur in a certain specified order, the probability of the outcome would be given by however, there are k)!] ways to select items out of a total of items. Therefore, if denotes again the random variable for the number of successes, the total probability is the sum, or P{K = k} = k!(n k)! As before, it is assumed that the events are independent of one another. Example 13.4. Probability of a year without freezing An obvious application of the binomial distribution could be the following problem. From a 45 y temperature record at a certain location it is known that in 26 y (out of 45) the temperature did not go below Thus the probability of a frost-free year can be = (26/45). estimated to be Equation (13.33) then provides the probability of frost- free years during a period of years; in Figure 13.7 the results are illustrated for the different values of during an 8 y period. A related problem is the determination of the probability of at least a certain number of years without freezing temperatures during a period of years; for instance, what is the probability that during the next 5 y the site will experience a year with freezing temperatures not more than twice?

{"text": "13.4.1 The normal distribution This is a well-known function, but it is useful to consider it briefly, mainly as a reference or benchmark to compare other less common distribution functions with it later on.

For convenient reference a few values are presented in Table 13.1. As will be seen below, the values listed in Table 13.2 for zero skew (i.e. for 0) are the quantiles of (x of the normal distribution for the indicated probabilities. The use of this distribution can be justified by means of the Central Limit Theorem; thisstatesthat,ifarandomvariableisthesumofn random,notnecessarilyindependent, variables, each with its own, not necessarily normal, density function with a finite mean and variance, then the density of this random variable tends to the normal function (13.34) as increases. In hydrology the normal distribution is commonly assumed to be applicable in the description of various types of central tendency observations, such as mean annual temperatures, annual river discharge rates, among others. Example 13.5. Probability distribution of annual mean streamflows In Figure 13.8 the annual mean values are plotted on normal probability paper for the Susquehanna River, as measured near Waverly, NY, for 57 years over the period 1938– 1994,andfortheChemungRiver,measuredatChemung,NY,for90yearsduring1907– 2000. Both stations are operated by the US Geological Survey.

The main point is that most of the data appear to obey the normal distribution fairly well, although it can also be seen that the wettest years plot above the best-fit line. As an aside, note that the largest mean flow rates at both stations were recorded for the year of Tropical Storm Agnes. This event took place in June of 1972; the total precipitation varied, with reported maxima of up to 450 mm, but over these two areas it was of the order of 150–250 mm over three days (Bailey al., 1975). It caused the most severe flood ever experienced in the entire Susquehanna basin and resulted in the loss of some 120 lives; at the time, this flood was the most destructive and elements of frequency analysis in hydrology costly natural disaster in the United States.

{"text": "13.4.2 The lognormal distribution Many natural phenomena, which have a lower bound and exhibit positive skew, cannot be described well by the normal distribution, but in some cases their logarithms can. According to the Central Limit Theorem, this would be the case when the random variable is the product of variables, each with its own arbitrary density function with a finite mean and variance. Upon applying Equation (13.24) with lnz to (13.34), the lognormal density function results, and it can be written as (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:5) (cid:6) 1 1 ln(x) where and are the mean and the standard deviation of ln(x).

The determination of is not always easy. A rough idea of its value can be obtained graphically by plotting the data on log-normal probability paper, i.e. ln(X versus produces the best straight line. The value of can in principle be obtained by the method ofmoments.Sincethefirsttwomomentsarealreadyusedin(13.40)todetermineμ σ, the third moment is needed.

Theideaofthelognormaldistributionappearstohavebeenintroducedintohydrologic practice by Horton (1914) after a suggestion by his uncle George W. Rafter in the 1890s. But Hazen (1914a) was probably the first to state explicitly, “. . . that if the logarithms of the numbers representing the several floods are used instead of the numbers themselves, the agreement with the normal law of error is closer.” For many years after that the lognormal distribution was the main function used in the United States to describe annual maximal river discharges for design purposes.

Lognormal distribution applied to annual peak streamflows The flow rate in the Cayuga Inlet near Ithaca, NY, has been measured since 1935 and the data have been published by the US Geological Survey (see also the web site W, at 133 m above sea level, and it has a drainage area of 91.2 after correction of the original precipitation data (Korzoun al., 1977) the average annual precipitation was estimated to be of the order of 1100 mm.

{"text": "13.4.4 The generalized log-gamma distribution A random variable is said to be described by the log-gamma distribution, also called the log-Pearson Type III distribution, when its logarithms obey a three-parameter gamma distribution.Acommonway(seeBenson,1968)ofdeterminingtheprobabilitywiththis distribution consists of the application of Table 13.2 with the first three moments of the logarithms of the data, as calculated with Equation (13.13). Inthelate1960sthisdistributionwasrecommendedbyaFederalinteragencygroupfor adoption by all government agencies in the United States for flood frequency analysis; this recommendation was arrived at (Benson, 1968; Thomas, 1985) to foster greater consistencyanduniformityinplanningforflood-plainmanagementandwater-resources development. It is now still widely used in the United States for this purpose. Further details and recommendations by this interagency group for the practical application of this distribution can be found in Bulletin 17B (Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data, 1982). Beside the standard application of the method, Bulletin 17B also contains suggestions on plotting historical data (i.e. dating from prior to the period of record), and regionalization with data from hydrologically similar watersheds. A more comprehensive treatment of this distribution was presented by Bob´ ee and Ashkar As noted earlier, the skew coefficient tends to exhibit greater variability between samples than the mean and the variance. This may be overcome by regionalization (see Section 13.5.2 below). Several techniques have been used in the past to obtain a regional value, in place of the locally calculated value, if the data record is short. These include the construction of a map with iso-lines obtained by interpolation of the values computedattheexistinggagingstationsintheregion;anotherpossibilityisthederivation of a regression relationship between the available skew values in the region and basin characteristics; finally, as a third possible approach, the skew may simply be taken as the average of all available skew values from the records in the region with long records; the average can also be weighted by multiplying each available value by the number of years of record at that gaging station divided by the average number of years of record of all stations in the region. Hardison (1974) has presented regional values of the skew coefficient for the annual peak flow rates in rivers in the United States, but with the availability of additional data since then, these results have gradually become obsolete. Tasker and Stedinger (1986) have further improved the estimation procedure of regional skew values. Example 13.7.

{"text": "13.4.5 The first asymptotic distribution of extreme values Extreme values and their initial distribution When several samples consisting of, say, items are taken from the same population, the mth smallest item in each sample is a random variable, which follows a certain distribution function. The form of this distribution function of the mth quantile depends elements of frequency analysis in hydrology on and n, and on the distribution function of the population from which the samples are drawn. When the distribution function of the population as a whole is mentioned in reference to the distribution function of the quantiles, it is often called the distribution. The extreme values of the samples are their smallest and their largest items. Obviously,thedistributionfunctionsoftheseextremevaluesofthesamplesdependonly on n, the number of items in the samples, and on the initial distribution. When the size of the samples is very large, i.e. in the limit when the distribution functions of the extreme values are called or asymptotes. Clearly, asymptotic distribution functions an extreme value asymptote no longer depends on and n, but only on the nature of its initial distribution. Inthestudyofextremevaluesthreegeneraltypesofinitialdistribution F(x)havebeen considered (Gumbel, 1954a; 1958). Each of these types results in a different functional form of the extreme value asymptotes. The first type, which is called the exponential type, comprises those distributions that for large converge to unity at least as fast as the exponential function itself; all their moments exist. These types of distribution satisfy and (13.45) for very large and for very small values of x, respectively. Since both numerator and denominatorintheseratiosareverysmall,thissuggeststheapplicationofdeL’Hospital’s rule; hence one can continue the process, to obtain for very large x, (cid:6)(x) 1 F(x) (x) and so on, and an analogous result for very small x. Examples of this type of distri- bution are the normal, the logistic, the gamma, and their logarithmically transformed distributions. The distributions of the second type are also referred to as distributions; Cauchy type these are distributions, which do not have moments above a certain order. The belong to the third type of initial distributions; these are distributions ited distributions with an upper or lower bound or with both. In hydrology they are mainly of interest in the analysis of low flows and droughts. This brings up the point that the classification into these three separate types of initial distributions is not always rigid. For exam- ple, the lognormal distribution is of the exponential type at the upper end, since can assume values all the way to infinity; however, it is of the limited type at the lower end of the distribution, because cannot be smaller than zero or c, as can be seen in Equations (13.38) and (13.39). The first asymptote for largest values This distribution is also often referred to as the Gumbel distribution after the statistician who clarified and promoted its use (Gumbel, 1954a; 1958). Several derivations have been presented in the literature. One of the simpler derivations proceeds as follows. The starting point is the Taylor expansion of the initial distribution about some characteristic some probability distributions for continuous variables large value of x, denoted by , or n n n n n From the definition of exponential type distributions (13.45) for large values it follows 1 F(u ) [1 F(u The value of is fairly arbitrary, but if it is defined such that its probability is given = − 1/n, by F(u ) 1 the derivation becomes especially straightforward. (Note that this is almost, but not quite, the average probability of the largest event in the sample, − 1/(n + some algebra, (13.47) can be written as (cid:13) (cid:14) α2 − α3 − α = )/[1 − parameter; thus, with the definition of , this series becomes = − exp[−α − Recall that F(x) is the initial distribution of the population from which the items of the sample were taken, and that it indicates the probability that any item of the sample is smaller than or equal to x. The probability that all items are smaller than or equal to G(x) (13.50) provided the items are independent of one another. Combination of Equations (13.49) and (13.50) produces (cid:5) (cid:6) exp[−α − In the limit, as the size of the sample is allowed to increase indefinitely, so that one obtains (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964, 4.2.21) the asymptotic distribution function of the largest values G(x) (13.52) (cid:6)(x), and the corresponding density function g(x) or g(x) (13.53) where (x )isthereducedlargestvalue.Thedistributionandthedensityfunc- tion of the extremes are denoted in this section by G(x) and g(x), merely to distinguish them from the initial distribution function and the initial density function, respectively. elements of frequency analysis in hydrology Probability paper based on (13.52), often referred to as Gumbel paper, is illustrated in Figure 13.3. In the derivation of Equation (13.52) its two parameters and were related to the properties of the initial distribution F(x). In practice, however, the parameters are determineddirectlyfromtheobservedlargestvalues.Bymeansofthemomentgenerating functions (Gumbel, 1958) the first two moments of (13.52) can be shown to be and 6) (13.54) γ = 0.57722 α where is known as Euler’s number. Thus the parameters and can be determined immediately from the first two moments of the largest values, as calculated with (13.13). Observe that, since the mean of the reduced variable is given by on account of the first of (13.54), it follows that so that 2.328; in other words, the first asymptote (13.52) predicts that the return period of the mean is 2.33 time units (e.g. years in the case X, the random variable in question, represents the annual flood). Note also that by putting 0 with + 0.36651/α with (13.52) one finds that the median is given by (u ). The first asymptote has been widely applied in the description of maxima. In hydrol- ogy, it has been especially useful in the analysis of annual floods, i.e. the yearly maximal discharges on record. It is useful to restate the assumptions on which the derivation is based, to gain a better understanding of its applicability. These are (i) the initial dis- tribution is of the exponential type; (ii) the events, from among which the largest are considered, must be independent; (iii) the sample size is infinitely large. In the case of the yearly floods, i.e. the maxima of the daily flows, these conditions are not really met. There is no doubt a strong correlation between successive daily flows; thus the truly independent events in one year are likely to last much longer than a single day; this greatly reduces their number from 365 to a value, which is probably not large enough to allow the use of an asymptote; this fact also obscures the nature of the initial distribution, which may not be exponential. Oneofitspracticaldisadvantagesisthat,sinceithasonlytwoparameters,allmoments above the second are related to the first two; this means, for example, that it has a third = 2.40411/α3 moment about the mean , and therefore a constant skew coefficient, = /σ3 = 1.1395. namely Only rarely does the estimated skew coefficient of a record of annual floods have this value. Of course, other two-parameter distributions, such as the lognormal or gamma distributions, suffer the same drawback. Another point of interest is the behavior of the first asymptote for extremely large events. Inversion of (13.52) with (13.15) yields the reduced variable as a function of the return period Since ln(1 z) (provided 1 and (Abramowitz and some probability distributions for continuous variables written as ln(T ) (13.56) or, to a good approximation, lnT (13.57) This shows that, if the largest events are plotted against on semi-log graph paper, they should tend to a straight line in the range of very large values of . This may be a useful procedure to apply, when no probability paper is available. It is remarkable also that Equation (13.57) is in the same form of, and thus provides a theoretical justification for, the equation proposed by Fuller (1914) to describe annual floods. Indeed, Fuller found empirically, “. . . by plottings of the existing data on American rivers” available to him, that the largest 24 h average rate of flow to be expected in years is = + 0.8logT (1 ) (13.58) in which is the average annual flood and log denotes the decimal logarithm; Fuller (1914) also observed that is proportional to where is the drainage The first asymptote for smallest values Whenever the initial distribution F(x) is symmetrical about the origin, in accordance with Equation (13.11), the probability that an observation is larger than is given by hence the probability that the smallest in a sample of independent observations is larger than is making use of this symmetry, one obtains G(x) (13.60) whereasbeforey (x ).Thusthefirstasymptoteforsmallestvaluescanbeobtained from that for the largest values by replacing and by and , respectively. Most initial distributions are not symmetrical; but Gumbel (1958) has indicated how in the case of asymmetrical distributions the symmetry principle can be extended simply by adopting new parameters, say and , instead of and . In other words, Equation (13.60) can still be applied but the reduced variable is (x ), and the parameters are derived from observations of the smallest values."}

Indeed while, in principle at least, different types of common events, suchasrainfallamounts,windspeedsorriverflows,canoftenbeassumedtobeunlimited in magnitude, even the smallest of such events can never be smaller than zero. Thus the smallest values often have a definite lower limit below which they cannot go.

Thus, as was the case with the first asymptote for the largest values, the parameters can only be determined from the available smallest values. In case one out of the three parameters is known (usually the lowest value ), the method of moments will require only the first two moments (13.69) and (13.70). If all three parameters have to be determined, the first three moments could be used, in principle. However, as noted earlier, the third moment is often unreliable, and a different approach may be desirable. Gumbel (1954a) has described a rapid method after a procedure developed by Weibull. First the value of is determined; since ) 1 one can take as the value of which has an observed probability of 0.632 or, which is the same from Equation (13.18), a return period of 1.58 time units. For example, in the case of annual low flows or “droughts,” can be taken as the magnitude of the 1.58 y event. The value of can be determined from the probability of the mean as observed from its plotting position. Thus is the solution of the combination of (13.65) with (13.69), that is 1 (13.71) The value of the lower limit can then be determined from the variance, as given by Equation (13.70), in which and are already known. elements of frequency analysis in hydrology Finally,itshouldbenotedthat,justlikethecorrespondingdistributionsforthelargest values in (13.61), the first asymptote for smallest values is linked to the third by a logarithmic transformation, as follows (cid:5) (cid:6) ln b(z ) (13.72) where now Hence, with (13.60) one obtains (cid:5) (cid:6) = − −exp = as given in (13.65). This shows how probability paper constructed for the first asymptote can be used for the third asymptote by plotting the logarithms of the magnitudes of the events, i.e. logx instead of (see Example 13.1). Hence, the lay-out shown in Figure 13.3 can be used for this purpose, by changing the scale of the ordinate from linear to logarithmic.

{"text": "13.4.7 The generalized extreme value distribution The first and third asymptotes were already shown in Equations (13.61) and (13.72) to be related by a logarithmic transformation. It should not be surprising, therefore, that the three asymptotes can be combined into a single expression. So far in hydrology, this idea has mostly been applied to the largest values. In this case the distribution function is usually written in the following form c)/b)1/a] F(x) a(x for 0 (13.74) in which and are constants. Clearly, when 0, the term inside the square brackets approaches an exponential function, and Equation (13.74) reduces to the first the extreme value distribution has three parameters, and can therefore be considered more general.

With this result can be obtained from the sample variance and (13.80), and then from the sam- ple mean with (13.79). If the data record is so short that the third moment must be considered unreliable, one can also apply the Weibull procedure, explained earlier for the third asymptote for smallest values. In brief, this consists of observing that Equa- = exp(−1); tion (13.74) produces F(c) thus the parameter can be estimated immedi- ately from the available data as the value of x, which corresponds with a probability elements of frequency analysis in hydrology 1) or with a return period of 1.58 time units. The two remain- ing parameters and can then be determined from the first two moments (13.79) and (13.80). The generalized extreme value distribution in the form of (13.74) was introduced in the environmental sciences by Jenkinson (1955), and it has subsequently found wide application in the prediction of various extreme phenomena, such as floods, rain events, wind speeds and wave heights; it has also come to be used in the estimation of regional Madsen al., 1997; Martins and Stedinger, 2000). Its full potential continues to be explored (Katz al., 2002). Example 13.8. Extreme value distributions applied to annual peak flows In this example a stream in a more arid climate is considered.

{"text": "13.4.8 Power law (or fractal) distribution Many natural phenomena exhibit a type of self-similarity or scale invariance in their magnitudes, such that, for instance, the ratio of the event with return period 100 and that with 10, is equal to the ratio of those with 1000 and 100.

The corresponding density function is (x) (13.86) In the practical application of this function, the parameters and can be derived simply by least squares linear regression of the logs of the observed values against the logs of their return periods , in accordance with Equation (13.84). The power distribution has been found useful in the description of numerous phe- nomena, such as fragmentation, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mineral deposits, and land forms, among others. In hydrology, the power distribution probably found its ear- liest application in the description of rainfall intensities. Equation (3.3), whose origins Figure 3.16.) A noteworthy feature in this particular application of Equation (13.84) is that its coefficient is also a power function of the duration of the rainfall event, for values of in excess of 2 h. In a different context, namely in the description of substitution of (8.5), suggests a power distribution and fractal features of the smaller pores; this is illustrated for a sand in the example of Figure 8.20, indicating a straight line for large values of the capillary suction H. More recently, the power distribution has also been used to describe flow maxima. Turcotte (1994) and Malamud al. (1996) have presented cases where it provided a better fit with flood data than the generalized log-gamma distribution. However, the distribution appears to be more applicable to partial duration flow data than to annual flow maxima. Partial duration flow series contain all the data above a given pre-defined base, whereas annual flow series contain only the peak discharge rates observed during each year of the record. The main disadvantage of an annual series is that in some years a number of events may be larger than the annual event in other years. In the analysis of very large events this is rarely a problem, because the two types of data series tend to be nearlythesameforeventswithreturnperiodsinexcessofaboutthreetimeunits,yearsin thiscase.Hence,intheestimationoftheparametersa and inthepowerdistributionfor annual peak flows, it is advisable to use only the data whose return period is larger than 3 y, or whose probability of non-exceedance is larger than 0.67. This is illustrated below in Example 13.9. The performance of the power distribution, to describe annual peak flowsincomparisonwithotherdistributions,isalsoillustratedFigures13.9,13.10,13.12 and 13.14. It can be seen that it tends to produce smaller values of the non-exceedance probability and of the return period, and therefore will usually lead to more conservative design values. Example 13.9.

Accordingly, linear regression of the logs of the flow rates against the logs of the return periods in = 48.10, = 0.3657. excess of 3y yielded the values of the parameters and Equation (13.84) with these parameters is plotted in Figures 13.13 and 13.14 as the heavy line 5.

Because most hydrologic records are notoriously short, it is desirable to include such information whenever possible. Historical information may be derived from archived documents, or from evidence of a botanical or paleo-event (see Kochel and Baker, 1982; Stedinger and Baker, 1987) nature found in the natural environment. Return periods In practice, inclusion of information from the period prior to the start of the record is concerned with the assignment of a plotting position to each historical event, whose magnitude is known, in order to estimate the return period. As an illustration of pos- sible scenarios for annual floods, consider the three cases discussed by Dalrymple (i) A single historical event, larger than any event during the regular period of record, is known to have occurred earlier. If is the number of years since that historical event or, better, the time since the beginning of recorded historical information, thereturnperiodofthehistoricaleventcanbetakenas(N 1),anditsprobability as 1)]. The regular record of duration is treated as usual. extension of available records (ii) An historical event is known to have occurred and is the largest ever, until an even largereventoccursduringtheperiodofrecord.Inthiscasethelargesteventduring the period of record is assigned the return period (N 1), and the historical = + 1)/2]. event [(N The remainder of the record is treated as usual with the second largest during the period of record assigned a value of [(n and so on for the third, etc. (iii) An historical record is available of all events above a certain base, such as for example “bankful stage,” and it can be assumed that the distribution of the lesser events during the regular period of record is typical for that of the entire histor- ical period. When the return periods or the corresponding plotting positions are obtained as outlined in the previous two cases (i) and (ii), there is a gap between data points of the regular record and those of the historical events, which causes some difficulty in deriving a best-fit curve. Such difficulty can be avoided, or at least alleviated, by means of Benson’s (1950) procedure; this consists of weight- ing the lesser events (i.e. those below base) of the period of record more heavily by adjusting or “stretching” their order numbers, so that they cover the historical period. Consider to denote the length of the historic period (e.g. the number of years since the first historical information became available until the present), the total number of events above base over that period, the number of events below base during the period of record, and the number of events that cannot be used (e.g. incomplete or missing records due to faulty equipment, etc.) during the period of record. Thus the weight assigned to each of the lesser events is and their adjusted order number is Forexample,iftheregularrecordconsistsofannualobservations,bythisprocedure eachdatapointbelowbaseismadetorepresent yearsinsteadof1y.Theplotting positionsandreturnperiodsofthelessereventscannowbedeterminedasbeforein (cid:6);forinstance,withtheWeibull Section13.2.4butwiththeadjustedordernumberm plotting position, these are 1) and (H 1 The larger events (i.e. those above base) are not weighted, but treated as usual, and their order numbers are not adjusted; thus they are in increasing magnitude Estimation of moments The same weighting method was also recommended in Bulletin 17B (Interagency Advi- soryCommitteeonWaterData,1982)toadjustthemomentsfortheparameterestimation of the generalized log-gamma distribution. From Equation (13.13) it follows immedi- ately that, when the lesser observations are weighted in accordance with (13.87), the elements of frequency analysis in hydrology adjusted moments can be calculated from the data as follows (cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (H 1)(H 2) where the circumflex denotes the adjusted moment, is one of the observations below base during the period of record, and one of the observations above base during the entire historical period to the present. Although commonly used in practice, the weighting method leading to Equation (13.88) for the plotting positions and to Equations (13.89) for the moments has its drawbacks (Hirsch and Stedinger, 1987). Better but more intricate methods have been proposed in the literature to accomplish the same objective. For instance, Cohn al. (1997; 2001) have developed a procedure to estimate the parameters by means of the method of moments for the generalized log-gamma distribution, which was found to be more efficient than Equations (13.89), and which is nearly as efficient as the method of maximum likelihood."}
{"text": "13.5.2 Regionalization Hydrologic data records are rarely available where they are needed. Moreover, even at the locations where a record is available, it is often too short to allow the reliable determination of the true distribution of the phenomenon of interest. Regional analysis, or regionalization, refers to the extension of available records in space. Its dual objective istoimprovetherecordatregularmeasuringsites,andtoprovideestimatesoffrequency characteristics at sites, where no data are available. In what follows several methods are reviewed which have been found useful in the analysis of flood peaks. Index-flood method Thismethodisprobablytheoldestand,asdescribedbyDalrymple(1960),formanyyears it was the standard procedure used by the US Geological Survey. The underlying idea is thatinahydrologicallyhomogeneousregiontheflooddistributionfunctionsfordifferent streams are similar; in this case similarity means that, when the distribution functions are scaled with their respective index-flood, the resulting dimensionless distributions of all basins in the region can be assumed to have the same shape, which is independent of drainage area and of any other basin characteristics. Accordingly, the method comprises two components. The first component consists of a regional flood frequency curve. To derive this curve, first the flood distribution curve of each streamflow gaging site in the region is made dimensionless, that is normalized, by dividing the flow rates by the extension of available records index-flood of the site; this index-flood is usually taken as the sample mean annual Theregionalfloodfrequencycurveisthenconstructedastheaverageorthemediancurve of the available dimensionless curves. The second component of the method consists of arelationshipbetweenthemagnitudeoftheindex-floodsandeasilyobtainablebasinand climate characteristics. In principle, many different characteristics can be used for this purpose; however, in past practice usually only the drainage area has been considered as the significant characteristic. To summarize, the end products of the analysis of the available flow data are a dimensionless regional frequency curve, and a graph or a regression equation relating the index event with drainage area. These two relationships can then be used to predict the frequency curve for any ungaged catchment. In practical applications, the index event is first estimated from the drainage area of the ungaged catchment, and as mentioned possibly from other relevant characteristics; this index event is used in turn to dimensionalize the regional frequency curve. While the analysis todevelopthesetworelationshipsissimpleinprinciple,italsorequiresadjustmentofall available records to a common base period, normally that of the station with the longest record. Examples of the application of this method can be found in Cruff and Rantz (1965) for coastal basins in California, and in Robison (1961) for New York State. In many studies based on this approach the mean floods, often taken as the events with y (cf. Equation (13.54)), were found to be related to the drainage area by an equation of the power type where and are constants for a hydrologically homogeneous region. For most regions wastypicallyfoundtolieintherangebetweenroughly0.65and1.00;thisisconsistent with Fuller’s (1914) earlier finding in relation to Equation (13.58). The main difficulty experienced in applying the method is that, although tests have been proposed for this purpose, it is not immediately clear how a homogeneous region can be defined or delineated in terms of frequency curves with a similar shape and in terms of hydrologically relevant basin characteristics. A more serious problem is that the frequency is scaled with only one parameter, namely the index event, usually taken as the first moment. Thus it is implicitly assumed that higher moments have no effect, or that these higher moments (when made dimensionless as and ) are constant within the region of hydrologic homogeneity. The limitations of this assumption have investigated (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). Quantile estimation with multiple regression Inthisapproach,firstthefrequencycurvesareconstructedforthestationsforwhichdata areavailablewithintheregionofhydrologichomogeneity.Onallthesefrequencycurves the values of the quantiles are noted at several selected return periods, say, 2 B,C, D,..., relevant basin, climate or other characteristics, as explanatory variables, elements of frequency analysis in hydrology by linear regression in a stepwise manner with an equation of the type b,c,d,..., in which are constants, whose values depend on the return period of the quantile.Characteristicstobeconsideredmayincludedrainagearea,mainchannelslope, main channel length, mean annual precipitation, fraction of area with lakes and ponds, meanannualrunoff, y24hrainfall,meanbasinaltitude,fractionofbasinareacovered with forest, basin shape as ratio of main channel length and area, mean basin elevation, and possibly others. The final selection of the characteristics to be included can be made on the basis of their respective statistical significance and on the basis of the reduction of the standard error caused by their inclusion. The basic idea and early applications of the method to the quantiles of annual floods were described by Benson (1962a, b) and Cruff and Rantz (1965). The method was also explored for other streamflow characteristics, beside the annual maxima, by Thomas and Benson (1970). The quantile regression procedure has subsequently been refined by means of a generalized least squares (GLS) procedure (Tasker and Stedinger, 1986; 1989) to take account of the fact that the stations may have records of unequal lengths and that concurrent observations at different stations may not be independent, but cross- correlated. With these improvements the method has become the main tool of the US Geological Survey to derive the frequency of flood flows for selected return periods on a regional basis in different states. A nationwide summary of the information derived as of 2002 was compiled by Ries and Crouse (2002). However, as more information is becoming available and the streamflow records become longer, the regression equations areperiodicallybeingrevised.Forsomeexamplesofrecentupdatesbystatethereaderis al., 2001). In these more recent studies the frequency relationships for each of the individ- ual gaged sites were commonly derived on the basis of the generalized log-gamma distribution with a regionalized skew. In most cases the delineation of hydrologic regions within the state and the identification of the important explanatory variables for Equation (13.91) were next carried out in a stepwise manner by means of ordinary least squares regression. The regions were usually delineated by inspection of the statewide regression residuals. Once the explanatory variables were identified for each region, the final predictive equations for the different quantiles in terms of the basin characteristics were calculated by means of the GLS procedure, as outlined by Tasker and Stedinger (1989).Theexplanatoryvariablesthatwerefoundtoaffecttheflowpeakquantilesvaried greatly from one region to another, but the number of adopted variables was usually kept as small as possible and restricted to two or three at most. In all regions the size of the drainage was found to be the most important variable and key basin descriptor; for some regions it was actually concluded to be the only significant one (Pope al., 2001; Wiley al., 2000). It has also been suggested on the basis of scaling arguments (Gupta al., 1994) that the sole dependency of on drainage area A, and on nothing else, can be used as the criterion to define a hydrologically homogeneous region. In regions with extension of available records Fig.13.15 Examplesofthedependenceof thecoefficientaT onthereturn period inEquation(13.92) withunitsofm3 for Curve1represents thevaluesforMaineasderived byHodgkins(1999),andcurves 2,3and4representthevalues 4 fortheSandHills,theBlue Ridge–Piedmontandthe CoastalPlainhydrologic regions,respectively,ofNorth 1 10 100 CarolinaasderivedbyPope etal.(2001).

In other regions the secondary variable was the fraction of the area occupied by lakes and wetlands (Hodgkins, 1999). In all past studies the quantiles were found to be related to drainage area by a power function, as in which and are constants depending on the return period of the quantile in question. The order of magnitude and tendency of these constants are illustrated for several regions in Figures 13.15 and 13.16. In most regions the constant lies in the and with the values reported for (13.90). However, is usually not a constant, and typically it decreases with increasing , as illustrated in Figure 13.16. This tendency indicates that the peak flow rate dependency on decreases with increasing severity of the flood; put differently, it means that the runoff per unit area (Q decreases elements of frequency analysis in hydrology more rapidly with increasing size of the drainage area as the severity of the flood increases. As an aside, if Equation (13.92) is valid, it follows that, unless is independent of and is a power function of , the underlying assumption of the power distribution the following criterion for the validity of the power distribution −b10 −b5 Ab100 Ab50 This shows that in this case the ratio in (13.82) depends on the drainage area; in other words, the equality in (13.93) needed for the validity of the power distribution requires a certain size of the basin, so that it is practically never satisfied. For instance, in the case 100km2,theleft-hand ofthetypicalvaluesobtainedforMaine(seeFigure13.16),for km2,theleft-handside sideof(13.93)is1.67,andtheright-handsideis1.82;for 1000 of (13.93) is 1.54 and the right-hand side is 1.65. Theoretical distribution functions with regionalized moments Theunderlyingassumptionofthisapproachisthatthemomentsinahydrologicallyhomo- geneous region depend on known or measurable basin and climate characteristics. Thus, once the moments can be estimated for an ungaged basin within the region on the basis of these characteristics, it becomes possible to calculate the parameters of the selected prob- ability distribution function. In principle, because several moments, namely the mean, the variance and the skew coefficient can be related to basin characteristics, the method is less restrictivethantheindex-floodmethod,whichmakesuseofonlythefirstmoment.Fortwo- parameter distributions the skew is not needed, and for three-parameter distributions, as it tends to be unreliable, a regional value can be assumed. The method has not been widely applied.Forexample,intheirapplicationtotheKlamathMountainsinnorthernCalifornia, Cruff and Rantz (1965) found that the sample mean and the sample standard deviation are both related to the catchment area and to the mean annual basinwide precipitation, respectively, by power functions similar to Equation (13.91).

{"text": "14.1 EARLIEST CONCEPTS: THE ATMOSPHERIC WATER CYCLE For as long as humans have been on Earth, they must have been acutely aware of their dependency on different forms of water in their environment. Water was literally vital for their health and sustenance but it could also be destructive and even lethal in severe weather,floods,andtheotherhazardstheyfacedintheirdailylives.Alreadyintheearliest writings there are indications that among natural peoples in their primal stage it was a common notion that water in nature moves continually between different states in some repetitive, if not cyclical, fashion. Whatever is left of these early writings is not always easy to interpret, mainly because the meanings of even the most elementary concepts have evolved in the meantime. Nor is it always easy to distinguish profane views and naturalistic descriptions from the more sacred narratives and religious interpretations. Nevertheless,acursoryscanofsomebetterknownearlywritingsyieldsseveralinstances of water related imagery even in widely different cultural settings, in which the evidence is fairly clear, and which provide some idea on the thinking of early humans. AsearlyastheeighthcenturyBCEinGreece,thepoetHesiodpresentedaremarkable description. In a passage with advice to farmers to get dressed warmly and to finish the For the morning is cold when Boreas [the north wind] bears down; in the morning from the starry skyovertheearthafertilizingmistspreadsoverthecultivationsofthefortunate;this[mist],drawn from ever flowing rivers, and lifted high above the earth by a storm wind, sometimes falls as rain toward evening, or sometimes blows as wind, while Thracian Boreas chases the heavy clouds. This passage contains interesting features; it explains that mist is derived from river water, and that it may lead to rain; on the other hand, it implies that evaporation may be both a result and a cause of the wind. Apart from the reference to Boreas, the god of the north wind, Hesiod’s passage appears quite naturalistic. Several water cycle related passages appear in the Hebrew Bible. The oldest among as follows (see, for example, Edition, 1976). Oxford Study He...whoturneddarknessintomorninganddarkeneddayintonight;whosummonedthewaters of the sea, and poured them over the earth; . . . he whodoes this, his name is the Lord. Amos, a native of Judah, was by his own account originally a shepherd and a pruner of sycamore fig trees. From the context, that is from the first part of this quotation which refers to the cycle of day and night, it is possible that the second part refers to some kind afterword of cyclical process as well; but if so, it is a cyclicity in the sense of periodicity and not in the sense of a water cycle. Here also, rain over the Earth results from evaporation from Book of Isaiah, namely, the following. This is the very word of the Lord . . . and as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return until they have watered the earth, making it blossom and bear fruit, and give seed for sowing and bread to eat, so shall the word which comes from my mouth prevail; it shall not return to me fruitless without accomplishing my purpose or succeeding in the task I gave it. Isaiah also lived in the eighth century BCE but this chapter is now generally considered a later addition and attributed to an unknown prophet, who wrote in Babylon toward the end of the exile in the sixth century BCE. In this passage the physical phenomena serve mainly an allegorical purpose and their description is fairly naturalistic; they appear to occur on their own and not as a result of direct divine intervention. The description involves unambiguously some kind of cycle by which water returns to where it came Notions on various cyclical processes were also held in ancient China. In a naturalist atmospheric phenomena are described as follows.

Still, it is equally plausiblethatitreferstotheevaporationofthesewatersfromtheseaandtheirsubsequent precipitation back to the sea. The main point is that it implies a cyclical process. The above descriptions are merely a few examples. A common feature of most of theseearlydescriptionsisthat,wherevertheyimplyawatercyclingprocess,theyreferto, or hint at, the atmospheric phase of the water cycle. Wherever evaporation is mentioned explicitly it is mostly, though not exclusively, assumed to take place from rivers and the sea. While some of the descriptions include flowing streams, they are silent on the origin greek antiquity of these streams or on whether or how the water returns to where the streams originated. The earliest speculations on this problem, which were not of an obvious mythical nature but based on observations, were probably those of the Greek natural philosophers."}

Inspection of their writings and other transmitted evidence indicates that water and various aspects of the water cycle played a central role in their cosmology. As seen in Hesiod’s passage, the atmospheric phase of the hydrologic cycle was already a common concept among the Greeks in pre-philosophic times (see also Brutsaert, 1982). Therefore, it is mainly the evolution of their opinions on the origins of springs and rivers, that will be examined in what follows."}
{"text": "14.2.1 The Presocratics The earliest Greek philosophers who were active in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE are customarily referred to as the Presocratics. Some of their writings were handed down to us in the form of fragments and some were paraphrased by later writers. Among these natural philosopherstwocompetingtheoriesprevailedontheoriginofthewaterinsprings,streams, and other fresh water bodies. These are the seawater filtration theory, which was probably the earlier of the two, and the rainfall percolation theory, which contains the essence of our present understanding. Seawater filtration theory The basic idea of this theory is that seawater seeps upward through the Earth, loses its salt by filtration and becomes the source of the springs and other surface waters (Figure 14.1). The written evidence points to Hippon as the earliest proponent of this view. Hippon of Rhegion,inwhatisnowsouthernItaly,alsocalledHipponofSamos,wasacontemporaryof Pericles,sohemusthaveflourishedaroundthemiddleofthefifthcenturyBCE.Hisopinion on the matter, in the only surviving fragment by him (Diels, 1961, p. 388) is formulated as follows.

Thisfragmentisratherterseandnotveryexplicit.However,itshouldbeseeninlightofthe factthatHippon’sotherviewswerenearlyidenticalwiththoseofThales,presentedatleast a century earlier. The following passage by Theophrastos in his (Diels, Physical Opinions 1879, p. 475) is revealing. Of those who say that the original principle (arche) is one and movable, whom he (Aristotle) calls physicists, some contend that it is bounded; for instance, Thales of Miletos and Hippon, who appears evento(have)becomeanatheist,saidthatwateristhefirstprinciple,beingledtothisbytheobservation ofthephenomena;forheatthrivesinmoisture,deadmatterdriesout,theseedsofeverythingaremoist, andallfoodissucculent;andnaturallyeachthingisnourishedbythatfromwhichitoriginates.Water is the principle of the moisture and the bond of everything. Therefore, they maintained that water is thefirstprincipleofeverythingandthattheearthevidentlyrestsonwater. afterword Fig.14.1 SketchoftheseawaterfiltrationtheoryofthePresocraticphilosophersinancientGreece.The writtenevidencepointstoHipponastheearliestproponentofthisconcept,butitwasprobably Thaleswithwhomitoriginated. Thales of Miletos in Ionia flourished around 585 BCE, and he is generally considered to be the first Greek natural philosopher, with whom the formal inquiry started into the reality behind the changes in the Universe. He does not appear to have committed his ideas to writing, and no actual quotations of him have survived. While there is nothing on the origin of rivers or springs, the essence of Thales’ views is well known and two of the most important ones are contained in the above passage; these are that the first principle of everything is water, and that the Earth rests on water. Hippon is mentioned here in the same breath as Thales, so it would be surprising if Hippon’s opinion on the origin of rivers were very different from that of the old master. It is, therefore, difficult to dis- agree with Gilbert’s (1907) opinion that Thales can reasonably be considered, as the actual originator of the seawater filtration theory, at least among the Greeks. But the roots of this theory may actually be much older. It is now known (see Eliade, 1978) that as early as the third millennium BCE, that is some 2000 years before Thales, in Sumer in lower Mesopotamia it was already a well established view that the Earth rests on the Hippon’sfragmentdoesnotmentiontheremovalofthesalt.Butthisaspectofthetheory theory, some 200 years later. It was this difficulty which led people to suppose that the sea was the primary source of moisture and of all water. So some say that rivers not only flow into it but out of it, and that the salt water becomes drinkablebybeingfiltered. This is a clear indication that the theory was around at the time of Aristotle and that it was taken seriously by many of his contemporaries. Rainfall percolation theory The earliest seeds of this second theory appear in the philosophical views of Anaximander of Miletos; Anaximander, a younger associate of Thales, was born around 610 BCE, and must have been in his prime around 565 BCE. While the issue of the origin of streams and rivers is not addressed directly, his main views can be deduced from the remaining evidence(seealsoGilbert,1907,p.405).Onthenatureandtheoriginofthesea,Alexander of Aphrodisias, a well-known commentator, who flourished around 200 CE, summarized Anaximander’s views as follows (Diels, 1879, p. 494). greek antiquity Some of them (natural philosophers) say that the sea is the leftover of the original moisture. As the region around the earth was wet, the first of that moisture was evaporated by the sun and became the winds,andfromittheturningsofthesunandofthemoonaswell;thus,astheturningsarecausedby thesamevaporsandbytheirexhalations,itbecomesthentheproviderofthesame(moisture)forthose revolving around them. The part of it (the moisture) that is left behind in the hollow places is the sea; therefore,itdecreases,asitiscontinuallyevaporatedbythesun,andeventuallyitwillperhapshaveto bedry.AnaximanderandDiogenes(ofApollonia)arrivedatthisview,thusreportsTheophrastos. Anaximander’s opinion on what happens to this continual evaporation was summarized by Hippolytus, a Christian writer of the early third century, who died in 235 CE; in his Refutation Windsaregeneratedwhenthefinestvaporsoftheairareseparatedoffandwhenevertheyareputinto motionastheygather;rainsaregeneratedfromthevaporthatisreleasedupwardfromtheearthbythe These two passages indicate that Anaximander considered the sea to be the remainder of theoriginalwateraroundtheEarth;theevaporationfromtheseaisthecause,insteadofthe result, of the winds and also the cause of the rains. There is no specific mention of streams. Anaximanderdidnotassume,asThalesdid,thattheEarthfloatsonwater,whichwouldthen flowupwardtothesurfacetofeedspringsandstreams;instead,heisknowntohaveposited that the Earth does not rest on anything and that it is suspended in the sky in some sort of equilibrium, because it is equidistant from everything on all sides. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have assumed that the sea feeds the streams by some upward filtration, as asserted by Thales and Hippon. Rather, it would seem more natural in his scheme that it is a different source of water, perhaps rainwater, which is feeding the streams that flow into thesea.Ontheotherhand,itisclearthathedidnotthinkthatalltheevaporatedwaterends up in streams and rivers, because the sea is gradually drying out; thus, he definitely did not propose a closed cycle. In any event, he seems to have started, or at least stimulated, a productive line of thought, as can be seen from the views of Xenophanes. Xenophanes of Colophon (c. BCE) was probably in his prime c. 530 BCE, which is roughly some 35 years after Anaximander. According to Aetius (in Diels, 1879, (Mansfeld and Runia, 1997), Xenophanes said that . . . what happens in the sky is caused by the heat of the sun; for, when the moisture is drawn out of the sea, the sweet part, which is distinguished by its fine texture, forms a cloud, and drips out as rain bycompressionlikethatoffelt,andthewindsvaporizeitaround.Andhewroteemphatically (an actual fragment follows in verse, Diels,1961, p. 136) Theseaisthesourceofthewater,thesourceofthewind.Forintheclouds,neitherwouldtheforceof thewind,whichblowsoutward,originatewithoutthegreatsea,northeflowingofthestreams,northe rainwaterfromthesky;butthegreatseaisthegeneratoroftheclouds,windsandstreams.... Regarding the saltiness of the sea, the opinion of Xenophanes is described by Hippolytus Theseaissalty,hesays,becauseofthemanyadmixtureswhichflowtogetherintoit. All this indicates that Xenophanes had some idea of the hydrologic cycle, as we now know it. He not only includes streams in his description, but he specifies that together with the winds, with the rain and with the clouds, the streams are caused by the evaporation from the sea. The only possible interpretation is that this occurs indirectly through the rain on the land surface. This is further supported by his explanation that the saltiness of the sea is afterword Fig.14.2 SketchoftherainfallpercolationtheoryofthePresocraticphilosophersinancientGreeceon theoriginofrivers.Theconceptappearstohaveevolvedfromroughbutseminalideasby Anaximander,followedbymorecompleteformulationsbyXenophanesandAnaxagoras. causedbythestreamswhichflowintoitcarryingdifferentsaltyadmixturespickedupalong the way. Clearly, the views of Xenophanes are a further development of Anaximander’s. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (c. 500–428 BCE), who came some 70 years after Xeno- phanes, appears to have been even more explicit on the matter. It is again from Hippolytus ...thattheseabegantoexistfromthemoistpartsontheearth,thatitoriginatedthiswayasthewaters initwerebeingevaporatedorsettleddown,andalsofromthedownflowingrivers;thattheriverstake their substance from the rains and out of the waters that are in the earth; for this is hollow and that it haswaterinthecaves. ButthemostsolidproofthatAnaximander,Xenophanes,Anaxagorasandperhapsother Presocratics developed the notion, that the origin of streams and rivers can be accounted for by rain (see Figure 14.2), is found in its attempted refutation by Aristotle in his Meteorologica, some one to two centuries later. Evidently, at the time of Aristotle, the rainfall percolation theory was well enough established, that he considered it necessary to mount a head-on attack against it. Aristotle (1952, I 349 b,2) summarized the theory as follows. Some people hold similar views about the origin of rivers. They suppose that the water drawn up by the sun when it falls again as rain is collected beneath the earth into a great hollow from which the rivers flow, either all from the same one or each from a different one: no additional water is formed in the process, and the rivers are supplied by the water collected during the winter in these reservoirs. This explains why rivers always run higher in winter than in summer, and why some are perennial, some are not. When the hollow is large and the amount of water collected therefore great enough to last out and not be exhausted before the return of the winter rains, then rivers are perennial and flow continuously:whenthereservoirsaresmaller,then,becausethesupplyofwaterissmall,riversdryup beforetherainyweatherreturnstoreplenishtheemptycontainer. The statement, that “no additional water is formed in the process,” is a clear indication that the rainfall percolation theory had eventually led to the concepts of a water cycle and of water mass conservation. From the space devoted to it in Aristotle’s Meteorologica, the rainfall percolation theory was undoubtedly the more widely accepted at the time. Both Anaxagoras and Aristotle refer to caves and hollows as the main underground storage spaces of water. This should not be surprising. About 65% of the terrain of Greece is limestone; this is easily eroded, resulting in a karst landscape (Higgins and Higgins, greek antiquity Fig.14.3 SketchofAristotle’stheoryontheorigin ofrivers.Whilerainpercolationprovides asourceofwater,thisisinadequateto supplythenecessaryamounts.Another importantmechanism,notunlikethe generationofrainabovetheEarth,isthe formationofwaterresultingfromcooling andcondensationofrisingvaporousair insidetheEarth. 1996), with sinks, underground streams and caverns. Present day Greece is known to be among the regions of the world most endowed with caves, some seven thousand of them and of all kinds, large and small, vertical, horizontal, inland and along the coast."}
{"text": "14.2.2 Aristotle It is generally agreed that Greek philosophy culminated with Aristotle (c. 384–322 BCE). Eventhoughinantiquityhewasacclaimedmoreasalogicianthanasanaturalphilosopher, his influence over the ensuing 18 centuries was to be so large, that it is necessary briefly to review his ideas here. On the origin of rivers and springs AfterhavingdescribedthePresocraticrainfallpercolationtheoryinthepreviousquotation, he immediately proceeds to present his own view (Aristotle, 1952, I 349 b,16). But it is evident that if anyone tries to compute the volume of water constantly flowing each day and thentovisualizeareservoirforit,hewillseethattocontainthewholeyearlyflowofwateritwillhave tobeaslargeastheearthinsizeoratleastnotsomuchsmaller. And though it is true that there are many such reservoirs in different parts of the earth, yet it is absurd for anyone not to suppose that the same cause operates to turn air into water below the earth as above it. If then cold condenses vaporous air into water above the earth, the cold beneath the earth mustbepresumedtoproducethesameeffect.Sonotonlydoeswaterformseparatelywithintheearth andflowfromit,buttheprocessiscontinuous. Aristotle does not reject the rainfall percolation mechanism altogether; but he feels that the available underground storage and the amount of rain are inadequate to supply the observed river flows, so that there must be another important mechanism at work. That mechanism is the formation of water out of vaporous air beneath the Earth’s surface (see Figure 14.3). Aristotle is correct in that water vapor does condense under the ground in caves; they are often wet and damp and water can be seen to drip from their walls and ceilings.Itisnowknown,however,thattheamountsproducedthiswayareverysmall,and thatregularprecipitationexceedsbyfaranykindofcondensationbeneaththesurfaceasthe water supply for springs and streams. Compared to the rainfall theory of the Presocratics, Aristotle’s explanation is definitely a step backward in the development of hydrologic has presented his argument strongly or clearly enough, because he continues as follows. afterword Besides, even if one leaves out of account water so produced and considers only the daily supply of wateralreadyexisting,thisdoesnotactasasourceofriversbysegregatingintosubterraneanlakes,as it were, in the way some people maintain: the process is rather like that in which small drops form in theregionabovetheearth,andtheseagainjoinothers,untilrainwaterfallsinsomequantity;similarly inside the earth quantities of water, quite small at first, collect together and gush out of the earth, as it were,atasinglepointandformthesourcesofrivers.Apracticalproofofthisisthatwhenmenmake irrigation works they collect the water in pipes and channels, as though the higher parts of the earth were sweating it out. So we find that the sources of rivers flow from mountains, and that the largest andmostnumerousriversflowfromthehighestmountains.Similarlythemajorityofspringsareinthe neighborhood of mountains and high places, and there are few sources of water in the plains except rivers.

Aristotleconcludestheparagraphbysummarizingonceagainhisownopinion:springsand the sources of rivers result both from rainfall and from condensation inside the Earth. On why the sea does not overflow Beside the origin of rivers, Aristotle also concerned himself with the problem why the sea The place occupied by the sea is, as we say, the proper place of water, which is why all rivers and all thewaterthereisrunintoit:forwaterflowstothedeepestplace,andtheseaoccupiesthedeepestplace on earth. But one part of it is all quickly drawn up by the sun, while the other for the reasons given is left behind. The old difficulty why so great an amount of water disappears (for the sea becomes no largereventhoughinnumerableriversofimmensesizeareflowingintoiteveryday)isquiteanatural onetoask,butnotdifficulttoanswerwithalittlethought.Forthesameamountofwaterdoesnottake the same time to dry up if it is spread out as if it is concentrated in a small space: the difference is so greatthatintheonecaseitmayremainforawholeday,intheother,ifforinstanceonespillsacupof wateroveralargetable,itwillvanishasquickasthought.Thisiswhathappenswithrivers:theygoon flowinginaconstrictedspaceuntiltheyreachaplaceofvastareawhentheyspreadoutandevaporate rapidlyandimperceptively. He calls it an “old difficulty,” so it must have been a problem of long standing in Greek philosophy; indeed as seen earlier, Anaximander had already thought about it and had concludedthattheseamayeventuallydryupaltogether.WhileAristotleseemstohavebeen the first on record to resolve the issue successfully by providing the correct explanation, it was considered elsewhere as well. For instance, it appears to have been of concern in ancient China (see Lin, 1949). In the Zhuang Zi (or Chuangtse, d. 275 BCE), raised the issue, as follows. There is no body of water beneath the canopy of heaven which is greater than the ocean. All streams pourintoitwithoutcease,yetitdoesnotoverflow.ItisbeingcontinuallydrainedoffattheTail-Gate, yetitisneverempty.Springandautumnbringnochange;floodsanddroughtsareequallyunknown. greek antiquity is a mythical hole in the bottom or end of the ocean; this depletion mechanism to balance theriverinflowsisclearlydifferentfromtheHippon–Thalesseawaterfiltrationmechanism and from Aristotle’s evaporation. The same issue was touched upon in the book L¨ (or Lu-Shih-Chun-Chiu), written a few decades later during the Qin (or Chin) dynasty by a team of scholars under Prime Minister L¨ u Bu Wei (or Lu Buwei, d. 235 BCE) 1959, p. 467).

Thetermswithinbracketsprobablyrepresenttheinterpretationofthetextbythetranslators; butthisinterpretationisnotunreasonableanditwouldbedifficulttocomeupwithadifferent meaning. Thus here the invoked evaporation mechanism is the same as Aristotle’s, and the authors clearly have some kind of hydrologic cycle in mind. The problem was to continue to receive much attention throughout Western history, and this preoccupation stemmed directly from (1, 7) in Ecclesiastes (Oxford Edition, 1976) as follows Allstreamsrunintothesea,yettheseaneveroverflows;backtotheplacefromwhichthestreamsran theyreturntorunagain. Ecclesiastes dates from the third century, about a century after the death of Aristotle and of Alexander (the Great), when Hellenistic influences had been spreading like wildfire all overtheMediterraneanworld.ThefirstpartofthispassageissoreminiscentofAristotle’s, that one has to wonder if the author of Ecclesiastes somehow had not been affected by Greek ideas. Ecclesiastes, like all the other Wisdom books, probably originated in the Jewish diaspora following the Babylonian exile, and possibly even in Alexandria, the very center of Hellenism. To be sure, the book is generally acknowledged to be quite different in literary style from the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, and it has even been said that some ancient rabbis were distressed by its pessimism. On the other hand, however, the description in the second part is not quite the same as the explanation given by Aristotle. Aristotle unequivocally attributes the fact that the sea does not overflow to evaporation; in Ecclesiastes the way by which “they return” is not specified, but one cannot help inferring some kind of seawater filtration mechanism. At any rate, this passage shows that the “old difficulty” was of concern in Judaism. This preoccupation was also shared later by most Christian writers, and it was to endure well into the Middle Ages. But the theme kept recurring: Dobson (1777) contended that his data supported the wisdom in this biblical passage and, as recently as 1877, Huxley (1900, p. 74) used the passage in his description of the hydrologic cycle."}
{"text": "14.2.3 The Later Peripatetics Upon Alexander’s death in 323, Aristotle decided to leave Athens and he handed over the leadershipofthePeripateticSchoolattheLyceumtoTheophrastos(c.372–287BCE).From the present vantage point, it would appear that Aristotle’s continued to be Meteorologica held in high esteem because it was an essential part of the Aristotelian body of works, as it came to the Arab world and later to Western Europe in the thirteenth century.

Moreover, for several centuries their writings were the only source of ancient philosophy available in Western Europe; they are therefore an indispensable background to understand and trace the thought currents that brought about the scientific revolution. The views of Lucretius (c. 99–55 BCE) in his work provide a revealing On Nature exampleofsomeaspectsofnaturalphilosophyinRome.InthefollowingpassageLucretius (1924, V, 261) deals with the problem of why the sea does not overflow and with the origin of springs. Moreover,thereisnoneedtosayhowsea,rivers,andspringsforeverwellupinabundancewithfresh watersandtheirstreamsflowunceasing:thegreatpouringdownofwatersfromallsidesmakesitclear. But, bit by bit, whatever comes first of the water is taken off, and the result is that there is no excess of liquid in the sum total: partly because strong winds sweep the surface and diminish it, as does the sun on high unraveling it with his rays; partly because it is distributed abroad through all the earth underneath; for the pungency is strained off, and the substance of the water seeps back, and all meets atthesourcesofeachriver,whenceitreturnsovertheearthinacolumnofsweetwateralongthepath whichhasoncebeencutforitinitsliquidcourse. A more elaborate but similar account is given in VI, 608–638. In contrast to Aristotle’s explanation,evaporationisnottheonlyreasonwhytheseadoesnotoverflow;seawateralso flowsbackundergroundtofeedthesprings,inaccordancewiththeoriginaltheoryofHippon and Thales. Also in contrast to Aristotle, who only considered the sun (Brutsaert, 1982), the latin era Lucretius allows for the wind to be involved in the evaporation process. One of Lucretius’ aims in writing his book was to promulgate the doctrines of Epikouros, whose natural philosophy,inturn,wasderivedfromtheatomictheoryofDemokritosandLeukippos;this passagefullyreflectsthis.Themainprinciplesofthistheoryarethatnothingcanbecreated out of nothing (or vice versa), which is equivalent with the principle of mass conservation, and that everything is made up of indivisible particles. This explains his view that on the whole there is no excess of water over the original amount, and that the winds are capable of sweeping water particles by evaporation. Unfortunately, beside the works of Lucretius and of Diogenes Laertius (1925) (third century CE), little is left that might give a better idea of what the Greek atomists themselves thought about these hydrologic phenomena. A completely different example of Roman thought is the comprehensive treatise on architecturebyVitruvius(MarcusV.Pollio),acontemporaryofLucretiusinthefirstcentury BCE.HecomposeditafterhavingservedasamilitaryengineerunderJuliusCaesarinGaul and in Spain. On the generation of spring water he wrote (see Vitruve, 1986, 8, 1) the following. Wesee,infact,thattherainwaterscongregateinthehollowsfoundathigherlevelsinthemountains, wherethetrees,whichgrowthereingreatnumber,keepthesnowforalongtimeandwhere,asitmelts little by little, it flows out imperceptibly through the veins of the earth; it is this water which, after it reachesthefootofthemountains,producesspringsthere. Vitruvius is explicit and specific in attributing springs to rain water and snowmelt which, after infiltrating into the ground, flow out at lower levels. He undoubtedly gained this insight during his military campaigns up north in Gaul, where rainfall and all kinds of seepageoutflowphenomenafromhillsidesaremoreobviousandmoreplentifulthaninthe more arid Mediterranean regions. Similarly, the writings of Seneca (c. 4 CE), born in Cordoba, and teacher and later advisor of Emperor Nero, also give a good idea of the status of natural philosophy amongeducatedRomans.InhisworkNaturalQuestionshequotedsome40references,five among them Latin authors, but the remainder Greek. Book Three is devoted to the waters of the earth. He successively discusses five theories on “. . . how the earth supplies the continuous flow of rivers, and where such great quantities of water come from” (Seneca, a river, the same will be so of streams and springs.” In brief, these five theories are (i) the seawater enters the land by hidden paths (that is why the sea does not increase) and is filtered of its salinity while in transit; (ii) whatever rainfall the Earth receives is sent out again through the rivers; (iii) rivers are supplied by primal fresh water in vast underground reservoirs; (iv) within the deep cavities inside the Earth the stagnant cold air ceases to maintain itself and changes into water; (v) “. . . all elements come from all others: air from therearenoprecedentsofthisfifththeory,sothismustbeSeneca’sown.Thefirsttwoare,of course, the theories of the Presocratics, the third apparently a cleaned up version of Plato’s Tartarus theory, and the fourth Aristotle’s underground condensation theory. While Seneca seems to be willing to admit more than one theory, he is totally opposed to the rainfall percolation mechanism. Because Seneca was to exert such a profound influence on later Itisobviousthatmuchcanbesaidagainstthistheory.Firstofall,asadiligentvine-gardenermyselfI assure you that no rainfall is so heavy it wets the ground to a depth beyond ten feet.

So you know that no water from the sky exists there nor any collection of moisture, but what is commonly called living water.Thetheorythatallwatercomesfromrainisdisprovedbyanotherargument:thefactthatcertain springs well up on the high tops of mountains. It is obvious that they are forced up or are formed on thespot,sinceallrainwaterrunsdown. Seneca apparently admits that most rainwater makes its way to river channels, but he feels that this is a short-lived phenomenon and that these quantities are insufficient to maintain a continuous river flow. He bases this argument on observations in his vineyards, which are certainly perceptive, and similar to the findings of Perrault and de LaHire in the late seventeenth century, as will be seen below. In the later stages of the Roman era Judaic and Christian views gradually gained in influence. In their writings the fathers, or early leaders, of the Christian church displayed a broad knowledge both of biblical accounts and of classical philosophy. But in their eclec- ticism among the different philosophical concepts they invariably accepted only those that couldbereconciledwiththebiblicalnarrative.ThesetofhomiliesOntheHexaemeron,i.e. this. Basileios had been educated in the classical tradition at Caesarea, Constantinople and Athens, and his writings generally reflect this background. In reference to Genesis (I,1,9) Forthisreason,accordingtothesayingofEcclesiastes‘Alltheriversrunintothesea,yettheseadoth not overflow.’ It is through the divine command that waters flow, and it is due to that first legislation, ‘Letthewatersbegatheredintooneplace,’thattheseaisenclosedwithinboundaries.Lesttheflowing water,spreadingbeyondthebedswhichholdit,alwayspassingonandfillinguponeplaceafteranother, shouldcontinuouslyfloodallthelands,itwasorderedtobegatheredintooneplace. Then, in (4, 6) he had this to say on the origin of rivers and springs. In the first place, the water of the sea is the source of all the moisture of the earth. This water passing throughunseenminuteopenings,asisprovedbythespongyandcavernouspartsofthemainlandinto which the swift sea flows in narrow channels, is received in the curved and sinuous paths and hurried on by the wind which sets it into motion. Then, it breaks through the surface and is carried outside; and,havingeliminateditsbitternessbypercolation,itbecomesdrinkable. Evidently, Basileios judged that among all available theories, the Hippon–Thales view was the main one in harmony with the creation events in Genesis and with the water cycle in Ecclesiastes. Similar views were promulgated some seventeen years later, around 389, by Ambrosius (c. 333–397) in his own Hexameron, which was partly inspired by that of Basileios. Ambrosius was then Bishop of Milan, but he had been converted to Christianity only at the age of 41, and his early education had been in the classical Latin tradition of 5, 22) are nearly the same as those of Basileios. The writings of Basileios and Ambrosius show how the fundamental concept of natural philosophy, as Thales had initiated it, was retained. Thus the Greek tradition of searching for an explanation of the physical world within that same world, without animistic or direct divine intervention, was continued. But the latin era the emphasis had shifted somewhat, since this knowledge had to serve as an aid for the transmission of the Christian doctrine and as an illustration of the wisdom of the Creator."}

And then Solomon says: the streams return to wheretheycomefrom. From which it can be understood that the sea does not increase also because, after being returned to their sources through some conduits hidden in the deep, the waters flow back and run back along the usual course through their rivers. But the sea was made purposely so it would receive the runs of all rivers. While its depth is variable, the equality of its surface, however, cannot be discerned. As a result, it is believed that it is called a plain, because its surface is even. But the physicists say that the seaishigherthantheland. ThetitleofIsidore’sbookisnearlythesameasthatofLucretius;also,asnotedbyFontaine (inIsidore,1960)itsoutlineisinmanyplacessimilartothoseofAristotle,Lucretius,Pliny and Aetius. So to organize his subject matter, Isidore must have had some doxographic references at his disposal, or at least a monastery school manual of such material. But it is striking how in this particular instance, Isidore’s treatment on the origin of streams comes closest to the opinion of Lucretius, quoted earlier. (Note that in the past Ecclesiastes has often, evidently mistakenly, been attributed to Solomon). Less than a decade later around Therefore, the reason why the sea does not increase, although it receives all the streams and all the springs, is as follows: in part, because its own magnitude does not feel the inflowing streams; further, because the salty water consumes the fresh water flows; or because the clouds attract to themselves a large portion of the water; also partly because the winds sweep it up, or partly because the sun dries it up; finally, because after having percolated through some hidden openings of the earth and having beenreturnedtotheheadofthestreamsandtothesprings,itrunsback. Isidore’s writings rapidly spread all over Western Europe, and they had a huge impact. Bede (c. 673–735), a Benedictine monk at Jarrow in England, who lived some 100 years later, also wrote a book Nature, which seems to be strongly inspired by Isidore’s. His section 40 on why the sea does not increase (Beda, 1843) is an almost literal summary of Isidore’s descriptions quoted above. Isidore’s influence is also evident in the work of HrabanusMaurus(c.776–856)ofMainz.EntitledvariouslyOnNatureorOntheUniverse, it was written around 844, at the height of the Carolingian Renaissance. Intended as an aid for preparing sermons, the text is replete with biblical references and Christian allegories and Hrabanus comes across as a well-read author; however, for his explanation on why the sea does not increase and on the origin of streams and springs, his main source was clearly Isidore. His section on this topic (Rabanus Maurus, 1852; 11, 2) is taken nearly verbatim from Isidore’s (13, 14) quoted above. These few examples show how by the end of the first millennium of the present era a number of concepts of Greek natural philosophy had been propagated in Western Europe afterword through Isidore’s writings. If Isidore deserves a place in this history, it is not on account of the originality or correctness – by today’s standards – of his cosmological views. However, hewaspartofatraditionthathassomescientificmerit.Tojudgefromhisspecificationthat thewindisacauseofevaporation,Isidore’shydrologicandmeteorologicdescriptionswere inspired indirectly by those of Lucretius; they are thus related to the views of the earlier atomists Demokritos and Leukippos, rather than those of Aristotle."}
{"text": "14.3.3 The High Middle Ages and the Renaissance Theseprevailingconceptsinnaturalphilosophyremainedroughlythesameuntilthebegin- ning of the thirteenth century, when Aristotle’s philosophical works began to draw greater attentioninWesternEurope.TheLatintranslationsoftheseworkswerederivedfromGreek originals, as a result of intensified contacts with Constantinople during the crusades, and from Arabic translations mostly in Moorish Spain (see Jourdain, 1960; Peters, 1968). In contrast to Western Europe, where his theories had somehow been overlooked until then, possibly as a result of the emphasis on Epicureanism and Stoicism among the Romans, in the Arab world Aristotle had been held in high esteem once his works had become available in translation. This is witnessed by the fact (cf. Mieli, 1966; pp 95, 102) that the famous philosophers Al-Farabi (d. 950) from Turkestan, and the Iranian Ibn-Sina (“Avi- after Aristotle. The history of Aristotle’s theories in the Arabic world, their subsequent acceptancebytheLatins,andtheireventualpenetrationintothevernacular,makeforsome fascinating reading. In the case of the Meteorologica, the first three books were translated early on from a partly abbreviated and corrupted Arabic version by Gerardus Cremonensis (d. 1187), and the fourth book, which does however not deal with meteorologic phenom- century later, around 1260, a more faithful version of the first three books was produced from the original Greek by Guillelmus de Morbeka (Willem van Moerbeke, c. 1215–1286) (Brams and Vanhamel, 1989). As a result, in the course of the thirteenth century, copies of these Latin translations started to appear in Western Europe, and gradually made their influence felt. Also, not long after the Latin translation by Willem, toward the end of the thirteenth century a Norman cleric, Mahieu le Vilain, made a translation of the Meteoro- into the French vernacular. An indication of the tremendous influence Aristotle’s works must have had, is the fact that for the period between 1200 and 1650 Lohr (1967– 1973) lists more than 85 commentaries on the Meteorologica, some of them by famous scholars like Alfred of Sareshel (1988), Albertus Magnus, Thomas de Aquino, Johannes centuriesandattheheightoftheRenaissanceEuropeanliteraturehadbecomefullyimbued with many of his physical theories. These theories served not merely as physical explana- tions, but they were also used as a rich source of metaphors and poetic imagery (Heninger, But while Aristotle’s ideas were ubiquitous and known by most scholars, they were far from universally accepted. The main effect of Aristotle’s Meteorologica, like his other works, it seems, was that it generated a common vocabulary, within a coherent system of logic, which stimulated more thorough discussion and the formulation of new questions, but not necessarily the answers, about the nature of the Universe. Thus, contrary to what is the latin era usually assumed about medieval scholarship, Aristotle’s theories were not always blindly accepted but they often provided the impetus for more correct interpretations. The writings isprobablybestknownforhisproverbialass(asinus)andalsoforthefactthat,inrebuttalto Aristotleandsome350yearsbeforeNewton,hehadsomeideaoftheprincipleofmomentum conservation.InhisbookQuestionsonthethreebooksofAristotle’sMeteorologica(Ducos, 1998, p. 82), Buridanus wrote the following. For it is also said to be possible that the water of the sea is evaporated and that the vapor is changed intoair,whichiscarriedbythewindtoadistantplace,anddescendstheretotheearthtoreplenishthe pores to avoid a vacuum, and is there condensed and changed into water, which comes to the spring andthenflowstothesea. In this passage he seems to admit that Aristotle’s mechanism of condensation inside the Earth may be possible, but then he continues in direct contradiction of Aristotle, pointing to the rain as the substantial source of the springs. The waters of springs come from the rains in this manner, because there are in the earth large hollow spaces which receive much rain water in winter, which for some hollow spaces suffices to flow out through the year until the winter rains return, and thus they are perpetual springs, which flow from these hollow spaces. There are other smaller hollow spaces which cannot receive in themselves so muchwater,whichwouldsufficetoflowoutthroughthewholeyear;therefore,thespringswhichflow fromthemdryupinsummer. Inotherwords,ifthecondensedwatercouldbeasubstantialsourceofspringwater,springs would not dry up in summer. This shows that among some influential scholars at the UniversityofParis,rainwastakenasthemain,ifperhapsnotthesole,agentinthegeneration of springs. Later examples, indicating that the rainfall percolation concept was not uncommon gave descriptions of the origin of springs and rivers that come generally quite close to the rainfall percolation mechanism as it is known today. It is worth noting that, just like Vitruvius, neither one was famous for his philosophical ideas; Palissy was known mostly forhispracticalandartistictalentsasaceramist,andBartas,asoldieranddiplomat,forhis poetry. Although both were Huguenots, their specific ideas on the origin of springs do not appear to be literal biblical accounts. But disagreement with Aristotle among some did not necessarily lead to improved concepts among others. For instance, Leonardo Da Vinci (1452–1519), in his notebooks (seeMacCurdy,1938,p.22)firstdescribeshowheatraiseswatervaportohigherelevations, where it condenses and falls as rain and hail; he then explains how in a similar way the same heat also draws up water from the roots of the mountains, through channels inside these mountains like through the veins inside the human body, to their summits, where the water can flow out through cracks and crevices to create rivers. He also concludes “. . . that the water passes from the rivers to the sea, and from the sea to the rivers, ever making the self-same round . . .” thus implying the seawater filtration mechanism to arrive back at the roots of the mountains. Another example is the description given by Descartes (1596– 1650)(1637,p.179),whichwasalsonearlythesameastheseawaterfiltrationtheoryofold. Hence, the fresh waters which flow into the sea, do not make it any larger because as many others leave it continuously. Some of these waters are raised in the air after being changed intovapors,andthenproceedtofallbackdownasrainorsnowontheearth;however,most afterword of these waters penetrate through underground conduits to beneath the mountains; from theretheheat,whichisintheearth,raisesthemasvaportothepeaks,wheretheyreplenish fountains and rivers. Seawater moving through sand becomes fresh because the salty parts, which are larger, more rigid and interlaced, cannot follow the tortuous paths around the sand grains as easily as the more slippery and smaller fresh water parts, and they are left"}
{"text": "14.4 From philosophy to science by experimentation In the course of the seventeenth century the general approach to science started to change, and gradually experimentation became an essential part of it. Pierre Perrault (1608–1680) and Edme Mariotte (1620–1684) were two central figures at this juncture of the history of hydrology. Their main merit was that, in contrast to the earlier writers on the subject, both relied on experiment and quantitative arguments. But to put their work in proper context, it is necessary to bear in mind the various opinions on the causes and mechanisms of river runoff, as they were then known to them."}
{"text": "14.4.1 The Common Opinion at the end of the seventeenth century The book by Perrault (1674) can provide some insight in this; On the Origin of Springs the first half of it, covering 146 pages, is devoted to a thorough review of the better-known theories and explanations of the day. The authors discussed by Perrault are Plato, Aristo- tus, Rohault, Fran¸ cois and Palissy. For each of these authors Perrault first gives a brief descriptionofthemainfeaturesofthepropoundedtheory,followedbyhisowncritiqueand reasons for rejection. After completing the survey, he then singles out one of these theories and further specifies (p. 148) how those, who support this particular view, ...believethatthewatersoftherains&ofthemeltedsnows,whichfallontheearth,penetrateituntil they encounter heavy (lit. greasy) soil or some other matter, which stops them; whereupon they flow to some opening on the slope of a mountain . . .

They also believe that it is the springs, which being joined together produce rivers, & that if there weren’t any springs, there wouldn’tbeanyrivers. This description of the sequence of processes, which is elaborated on further on pp. 151– 152,couldhavebeenwrittentoday,anditwouldnotbeoutofplaceamongthedescriptions reviewed in Chapter 11. It is remarkable, therefore, that in 1674 Perrault calls this the “Opinion Commune” or “Common Opinion.” But even more remarkable is the fact that he also points out that among his 22 “authors,” by which he means the learned men and authorities on the subject, only four espoused this opinion, to wit Vitruvius, Gassendi, Palissy and Fran¸ cois. In other words, although only a small minority among the expert natural philosophers held this view, he chooses to call it the Common Opinion. Could this meanthattowardtheendoftheseventeenthcentury,almosteveryoneelse,thatistheperson “in the street,” was already of the opinion that springs and rivers are produced by rainfall percolation? from philosophy to science by experimentation"}
