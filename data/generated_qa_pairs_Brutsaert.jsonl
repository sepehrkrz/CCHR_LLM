{"paragraph": "1.1 DEFINITION AND SCOPE Hydrology is literally the science of water. Etymologically, the word has its roots in υδωρ, λ´ oγoς, ancient Greek, and is a composite, made up of ´ water, and word. Obvi- ously, defined this way, the term is much too broad to be very useful, as it would have ramifications in all scientific disciplines. Actually, the word hydrology has not always been well defined and even as recently as the 1960s it was not very clear exactly what hydrology was supposed to cover and encompass. Price and Heindl (1968), in a survey of many of the definitions that had appeared in the literature over the previous 100 years, were compelled to conclude that the question “What is Hydrology?” had not been resolved by their review. Still, they felt that, in general, there seemed to be a consensus that hydrology is a physical science, which is concerned mainly with the water cycle of land and near-shore areas; moreover, there had been a tendency to broaden the term rather than to narrow it, even to the point of including socio-economic aspects. Overthepastfewdecades,however,withthegrowingactivitylevelandtheincreasing maturity of this field of endeavor, a more precise definition has emerged. Hydrology is nowwidely(see,forexample,Eagleson,1991)acceptedtobethesciencethatdealswith those aspects of the cycling of water in the natural environment that relate specifically thecontinentalwaterprocesses,namelythephysicalandchemicalprocessesalong the various pathways of continental water (solid, liquid and vapor) at all scales, including those biological processes that influence this water cycle directly; and balance, namely the spatial and temporal features of the water the global water transfers (solid, liquid and vapor) between all compartments of the global system, i.e. atmosphere, oceans and continents, in addition to stored water quantities and residence times in these compartments. Becauseitisdefinedasbeingconcernedspecificallywithcontinentalwaterprocesses, hydrologyisadisciplinedistinctfrommeteorology,climatology,oceanology,glaciology and others that also deal with the water cycle in their own specific domains, namely the hydrology integrates and links these other geosciences, in that through the global water balance it is also concerned with the exchanges of water between all these separate compartments. introduction Withthisdefinitionitisnowalsopossibletodelineatethepracticalscopeofhydrologic analysis in engineering and in other applied disciplines. It consists of the determination of the amount and/or flow rate of water that will be found at a given location and at a given time under natural conditions, without direct human control or intervention. The latter specification, that no human control be involved, is necessary to distinguish hydrology from the related discipline of hydraulics. Hydraulics is concerned with the studyofcontrolledfluidmotioninwell-definedandofteninhuman-madeenvironments. For instance, problems involving pipe flow, irrigation water distribution or pumping of groundwater are not hydrologic in nature, but are more properly assigned to the realm of hydraulics.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrology's definition, what are the etymological roots of the term \"hydrology\"?", "answer": "The term \"hydrology\" has its roots in ancient Greek, specifically from υδωρ (water) and λ´ oγoς (word), making it literally the science of water."}, {"question": "How has the definition of hydrology evolved over time, particularly in relation to its scope and coverage?", "answer": "The definition of hydrology has evolved significantly over time. Initially, the term was too broad and not well-defined, with its scope and coverage not clearly established even as recently as the 1960s. However, with the growing activity level and increasing maturity of the field, a more precise definition has emerged, focusing on the science that deals with the aspects of the cycling of water in the natural environment related to continental water processes. This includes physical and chemical processes along various pathways of continental water, as well as biological processes that influence the water cycle directly."}, {"question": "In the context of distinguishing hydrology from other disciplines, why is it essential to specify that hydrology is concerned with continental water processes?", "answer": "It is essential to specify that hydrology is concerned with continental water processes to distinguish it from other disciplines such as meteorology, climatology, oceanology, and glaciology, which also deal with the water cycle but in their own specific domains. This distinction allows hydrology to be recognized as a unique discipline that integrates and links these other geosciences through the global water balance, focusing on the exchanges of water between all compartments of the global system."}, {"question": "What is the practical scope of hydrologic analysis in engineering and other applied disciplines, and how does it differ from hydraulics?", "answer": "The practical scope of hydrologic analysis involves determining the amount and/or flow rate of water at a given location and time under natural conditions, without direct human control or intervention. This differs from hydraulics, which is concerned with the study of controlled fluid motion in well-defined and often human-made environments, such as pipe flow, irrigation water distribution, or pumping of groundwater. The key distinction lies in the absence of human control in hydrologic analysis, setting it apart from hydraulic applications."}, {"question": "How does hydrology integrate with other geosciences, and what role does the global water balance play in this integration?", "answer": "Hydrology integrates with other geosciences such as meteorology, climatology, oceanology, and glaciology through the global water balance. The global water balance concerns the spatial and temporal features of water transfers between all compartments of the global system, including the atmosphere, oceans, and continents, as well as stored water quantities and residence times in these compartments. This integration allows hydrology to consider the exchanges of water between these compartments, providing a comprehensive understanding of the water cycle and its various components."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic analysis, why is it necessary to exclude human control or intervention?", "answer": "Excluding human control or intervention is necessary in hydrologic analysis to distinguish it from hydraulics and to focus on natural conditions. This exclusion allows hydrologists to study and understand the natural behavior of water in the environment, without the influence of human activities such as water management, engineering structures, or other interventions that could alter the natural water cycle. By doing so, hydrologists can provide insights into the natural processes that govern water movement and availability, which is essential for predicting and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "What are the implications of hydrology being a physical science concerned mainly with the water cycle of land and near-shore areas?", "answer": "The implications of hydrology being a physical science concerned mainly with the water cycle of land and near-shore areas are significant. It means that hydrology focuses on understanding the physical processes that govern water movement and availability in these regions, including the cycling of water between the atmosphere, oceans, and continents. This focus has important implications for managing water resources, predicting water-related hazards, and understanding the impacts of climate change on water availability and quality."}, {"question": "How does the definition of hydrology as a science that deals with continental water processes influence its relationship with socio-economic aspects?", "answer": "The definition of hydrology as a science that deals with continental water processes does not explicitly exclude socio-economic aspects, but rather focuses on the physical and chemical processes that govern water movement and availability. However, the growing recognition of the importance of socio-economic factors in water management and the increasing maturity of the field have led to a broader understanding of hydrology that may include socio-economic aspects. This broader understanding acknowledges that hydrology is not isolated from human activities and that socio-economic factors can influence water availability, quality, and management."}, {"question": "In the context of the water cycle, what role do biological processes play, and how do they influence the water cycle directly?", "answer": "Biological processes play a significant role in the water cycle, influencing it"}]}
{"paragraph": "1.2 THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE Thewatercycle,alsocalledthehydrologiccycle,referstothepathwayofwaterinnature, asitmovesinitsdifferentphasesthroughtheatmosphere,downoverandthroughtheland, to the ocean and back up to the atmosphere. When atmospheric water vapor condenses and precipitates over land, initially it moistens the surface and some amount of it is stored as interception, which later evaporates. As (and in a similar way precipitation snowmelt) continues, part of it may flow over the surface in the form of overland flow or runoff, and part of it may enter into the soil as infiltration. This surface runoff soon tends to collect locally, either in puddles or small ponds as storage, or depression in gullies or larger channels where it continues as streamflow, which ultimately ends up in a larger water body, such as a lake or the ocean. Streamflow is normally described by a hydrograph, that is the rate of flow at a gaging station as a function of time. The infiltratedwatermayflowrapidlythroughthenear-surfacesoillayerstoexitintosprings or adjacent streams, or it may percolate more slowly through the profile to join the groundwater, which sooner or later seeps out into the natural river system, lakes and other open water bodies; part of the infiltrated water is retained in the soil profile by capillarity and other factors, where it is available for uptake by the roots of vegetation. Soil layers and other geologic formations, whose pores and interstices can transmit water, are called aquifers. When an aquifer is in direct contact with the land surface, it is referred to as unconfined. The locus of points in an unconfined aquifer, where the water pressure is atmospheric, is called the table. Although the water table is not a true freesurfaceseparatingasaturatedzonefromadryzone,itissometimesassumedtobethe upper boundary of the groundwater in an unconfined aquifer. The partly saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer, between the water table and the ground surface, is sometimes referred to as the zone. In an unconfined aquifer, the term refers vadose groundwater usually to the water found below the water table; or refers to the soil water soil moisture water above the water table. A water bearing geologic formation, that is separated from the surface by an impermeable layer, is referred to as a aquifer.

When evaporation takes place through the stomates of vegetation, it can be referred to as transpiration. Direct evaporation from open water or soil surfaces and transpiration of biological water from plants are not easy to separate; therefore the combined process is sometimes called evapotranspiration. Evaporation of ice is commonly referred to as sublimation. While these distinctions are useful at times, the term evaporation is usually adequate to describe all processes of vaporization. Some of the main processes are drawn schematically in Figure 1.1.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the hydrologic cycle, what is the primary pathway of water as it moves through the atmosphere, land, and ocean?", "answer": "The primary pathway of water in the hydrologic cycle involves the movement of water in its different phases through the atmosphere, down over and through the land, to the ocean, and back up to the atmosphere."}, {"question": "How does atmospheric water vapor contribute to the hydrologic cycle when it condenses and precipitates over land?", "answer": "When atmospheric water vapor condenses and precipitates over land, it initially moistens the surface and some amount of it is stored as interception, which later evaporates. This process is crucial as it sets off a series of subsequent hydrological processes including infiltration, runoff, and eventually, the replenishment of groundwater and surface water bodies."}, {"question": "In the process of infiltration, why does part of the precipitated water flow rapidly through the near-surface soil layers to exit into springs or adjacent streams?", "answer": "Part of the infiltrated water flows rapidly through the near-surface soil layers to exit into springs or adjacent streams because the soil layers and other geologic formations, known as aquifers, have pores and interstices that can transmit water. This rapid movement is influenced by factors such as the permeability of the soil and the pressure gradient within the aquifer. The water that moves rapidly through these layers contributes to the quick replenishment of surface water bodies, highlighting the dynamic interaction between groundwater and surface water systems."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the water table in an unconfined aquifer, and how does it relate to the saturated and unsaturated zones?", "answer": "The water table in an unconfined aquifer is the locus of points where the water pressure is atmospheric, and it is often considered the upper boundary of the groundwater. Although not a true free surface separating a saturated zone from a dry zone, the water table demarcates the boundary below which the soil is saturated with water (the saturated zone) and above which the soil may be partially saturated (the unsaturated or vadose zone). Understanding the water table's position and movement is crucial for managing groundwater resources, as it directly affects the availability of water for plants, animals, and human consumption."}, {"question": "How does evapotranspiration contribute to the closure of the hydrologic cycle, and what processes are included under this term?", "answer": "Evapotranspiration, which includes direct evaporation from open water or soil surfaces and transpiration of biological water from plants, contributes to the closure of the hydrologic cycle by returning water back into the atmosphere. This process is essential as it completes the cycle, allowing water to evaporate and eventually condense and precipitate again. The distinction between evaporation and transpiration is not always clear-cut, and thus, the combined process of evapotranspiration is often used to describe all vaporization processes, including the evaporation of ice, known as sublimation."}, {"question": "In the context of streamflow, what is the difference between base flow and storm flow, and how are they related to groundwater and surface runoff?", "answer": "Base flow refers to the streamflow resulting from groundwater outflow, which is a more constant and sustained flow. In contrast, storm flow or storm runoff is the flow caused by precipitation, which is more variable and transient. Base flow is fed by both surface runoff and subsurface flow from riparian aquifers, indicating the interconnectedness of groundwater and surface water systems. The distinction between these flows is important for understanding the hydrologic response of a catchment to different climatic conditions and for managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to separate direct evaporation from open water or soil surfaces and transpiration of biological water from plants in the context of evapotranspiration?", "answer": "It is challenging to separate direct evaporation from open water or soil surfaces and transpiration of biological water from plants because these processes occur simultaneously and are closely intertwined. Transpiration through plants involves the movement of water from the soil into the plant and then into the atmosphere, a process that is difficult to distinguish from evaporation occurring at the soil surface or from open water bodies. This challenge highlights the complexity of hydrological processes and the need for comprehensive models and measurements to accurately quantify evapotranspiration."}, {"question": "How does the hydrologic cycle illustrate the concept of water balance, and what are the implications of this balance for global water resources?", "answer": "The hydrologic cycle illustrates the concept of water balance by showing how water is continuously cycled between the atmosphere, land, and ocean. This balance is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems, supporting human consumption, and regulating climate. The implications of this balance for global water resources are significant, as any disruption in the cycle, such as changes in precipitation patterns or increased evaporation due to climate change, can have profound effects on water availability, quality, and distribution. Understanding and managing this balance is essential for ensuring"}]}

As shown in Table 1.1, the average annual precipitation and also evaporation are of the order of 1 m for the entire Earth. Over the landsurfaces the average precipitation intensity, P, is about 0.80 m whereas the corresponding average evaporation, E, is around 0.50 m or about 60% to 65% of the precipitation. Under steady condi- tions, that is for long time periods, the remainder can be considered to be runoff from the landsurfaces into the oceans, (expressed as height of water column per unit of time), or Averaged over all continents and over long time periods, the annual runoff is therefore around 35% to 40% of the precipitation. Except for South America and Antarctica (see Table 1.2), the values for the individual continents are not very different from the global values.Precipitationandstreamflowrunoffmeasurementshavebeenandarebeingmade routinely in many places on Earth. In contrast, evaporation has not received as much attention and no systematic measurements are available. Estimatesoftheaveragedistributionofwaterindifferentformsexpressedasdepthof water covering the globe, assumed to be a perfect sphere, are given in Table 1.3. These indicate that the 1 m of average annual precipitation is relatively large as compared to the active fresh water on Earth, that is the water which is not stored in permanent ice and deep groundwater. This means that the turnover of the active part of the hydrologic cycle is rather fast, and that the residence times in some of the major compartments of the water cycle are relatively short; the mean residence time can be taken as the ratio of the storage and the flux in or out of storage. For example, a continental runoff rate of of the world occupied by land, gives a mean residence time of the order of 13 days for the rivers of the world.

The major portion of the incoming radiation is absorbed near the surface of the Earth, and it is transformed into internal energy. The subsequent partition of this internal energy into long-wave back radiation, upward thermal conduction and convec- tion of sensible heat H, and latent heat E, is one of the main processes driving the atmosphere.

This implies that the remainder, under steady conditions, can be considered as runoff from the land surfaces into the oceans. This runoff is approximately 35% to 40% of the precipitation, indicating a significant portion of precipitation is lost to evaporation rather than contributing to runoff."}, {"question": "Why is the turnover of the active part of the hydrologic cycle considered fast, and what does this mean for the residence times in major compartments of the water cycle?", "answer": "The turnover of the active part of the hydrologic cycle is considered fast because the 1 m of average annual precipitation is relatively large compared to the active fresh water on Earth, which is not stored in permanent ice and deep groundwater. This fast turnover means that the residence times in some of the major compartments of the water cycle are relatively short. For example, the mean residence time in rivers can be as short as 13 days, and in the atmosphere, it can be around 9 days.

This indicates that a significant portion of the energy received from the sun is used for evaporation, which plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy balance and climate."}, {"question": "What is the role of evaporation in the global energy balance, and why is it significant for weather and climate?", "answer": "Evaporation plays a central role in the global energy balance as it involves the transfer and redistribution of large amounts of energy under nearly isothermal conditions. This process is significant because, upon condensation and subsequent precipitation, it releases energy, which is the largest single heat source for the atmosphere. This energy release drives atmospheric circulation and, consequently, weather and climate patterns. The significance of evaporation in the energy balance highlights the intimate connection between the water cycle and climate, emphasizing the importance of understanding hydrological processes for predicting and managing climate-related phenomena."}, {"question": "How does the distribution of precipitation and evaporation vary globally, and what are the implications for local hydrological cycles?", "answer": "The distribution of precipitation and evaporation varies widely across different locations. While long-term mean values of precipitation and evaporation can be negligible in desert locations, maximal annual precipitation values can reach up to 26.5 m in mountainous monsoon environments, and maximal mean evaporation values can be as high as 3.73 m in certain oceanic regions.

Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations can alter precipitation patterns, evaporation rates, and other components of the hydrologic cycle, which in turn affect climate. This interplay between the hydrologic cycle and climate suggests that understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change on the water cycle is essential for managing water resources and mitigating the effects of climate change.

{"paragraph": "1.4.1 Statistical analysis and data transformation As observed in Section 1.2, one of the main practical objectives of hydrologic analysis is the determination of the quantity of water, in storage or in transit, to be found at a given time and place, free of any direct human control. When a reliable record of observed hydrologic data is available, a great deal can be learned simply by a statistical analysis of this record. Although such an approach is proper for stationary systems in the prediction of long-term behavior for general planning purposes, it cannot be used for short-term and emergency forecasting, for example, during floods, or for day-to-day resource management decisions.

{"paragraph": "1.4.2 The “physical” versus the “systems” approach The hydrologic literature is replete with attempts at classifying the methodologies and paradigms that have been used to transform hydrologic input into hydrologic output information. Until a few years ago it had become customary to consider two contrasting approaches,namelythe“physical”approachandthe“systems”approach.Inthephysical approach the input–output relationship is sought by the solution of the known conser- vation equations of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics with appropriate boundary conditions to describe the flow and transport of water throughout the hydrologic cycle. Thisapproachhasobviouslimitations;thephysiographicandgeomorphiccharacteristics ofmosthydrologicsystemsaresocomplicatedandvariable,andthedegreeofuncertainty in the boundary conditions so large, that solutions are feasible only for certain highly simplified situations. In other words, the properties of natural catchments can never be measured accurately enough, and solutions, based on internal descriptions starting from introduction first principles of fluid mechanics, can be obtained only for grossly idealized conditions, which are coarse approximations of any real situation. based on a diametrically opposite philosophy. In this approach the physical structure of the various components of the hydrologic cycle and their inner mechanisms are not considered;instead,eachcomponent,howeveritmaybedefined,isthoughtofasa“black box,” and the analysis focuses on discovering a mathematical relationship between the moisture, evaporation, etc.). The structure of this mathematical relationship is mostly quiteremotefromthephysicalstructureoftheprototypephenomenainnature.Thislack ofcorrespondencebetweentheinnerphysicalmechanismsandthepostulatedfunctional formalismsmakesthisapproachquitegeneraloperationally,becauseitpermitstheuseof well-known algorithms and objective criteria in identification and prediction. However, this also underlies the main limitations of this approach. First, in assigning cause and effect the definition of input and output variables is mostly based on intuition guided by past experience, and the danger exists that some important phenomena are overlooked. Second, the best that can ever be expected with a black box approach is a satisfactory reproduction of a previously obtained input–output record; even when such data are available, it is difficult to accommodate fully the nonstationary effects in the system, and it is impossible to anticipate subsequent hydrologic changes, such as those resulting from urbanization, deforestation, reclamation, or climate change. Because many hydrologic methods do not really fit in this physical-versus-empirical classification, a third possible approach was taken to be an intermediate one. In this view the performance of a hydrologic unit, say a catchment, is represented in terms of some idealized components or “grey boxes,” which correspond to recognizable ele- ments in the prototype, whose input–output response functions are structured after solutions of some tractable or suitably simplified situations of the physical processes perceived to be relevant. This third way was often called the “conceptual model” approach. At first sight, a classification based on three distinct approaches, namely physical, empirical and conceptual, may appear reasonable. However, it is less than obvious how this classification can be applied to specific cases. Indeed, one might ask what the dif- ference is between physical and empirical. After all, the essence of physical science is experimentation and conceptualization. Moreover, the physical approach of one dis- cipline is usually the empiricism or the conceptual model of another. For example, Newton’s “law” of viscous shear constitutes the physical basis of a wide area of fluid mechanics, whereas it represents a mere black box simplification in molecular physics.

{"paragraph": "1.4.3 Spatial scale and parameterization General approach All natural flow phenomena are governed by the principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, which can be expressed by a number of equations to provide a mathematical description of what goes on. However, because there are normally more dependent variables than available conservation equations, in order to close the system, additional relationships must be introduced. These closure relationships, also called parameterizations,relatesomeofthevariableswitheachothertodescribecertainspecific physical mechanisms; the mathematical form of these relationships, and the values of the material constants or are usually based on experimentation. parameters A second point is that any physical phenomenon must be considered at a given scale; this scale is the available (depending on the data) or chosen (depending on the objectives of the study) resolution. It will become clear later on in this book that, while the funda- mental conservation equations remain unaffected by the scale at which the phenomenon is being considered, most closure relationships in them are quite sensitive to scale. Indeed, a parameterization can be considered as a mathematical means of describing the subresolution (or microscale) processes of the phenomenon, in terms of resolvable scale (or macroscale) variables; these macroscale variables are the ones, which can be treated explicitly in the analysis or for which measured records are obtainable. Thus, the details of the microscale mechanisms are not considered explicitly, but their statis- tical effect is formulated mathematically by a parameterization in terms of macroscale variables. Allthissuggeststhatasoundcriteriontodistinguish,inprincipleatleast,oneapproach from another, may be the spatial scale at which the internal mechanisms are parame- terized. For example, Newton’s equation for viscous shear stress (see Equation (1.12) below)isaparameterizationintermsofvariablestypicallyatthemillimetertocentimeter scale; however, it reflects momentum exchanges at molecular scales, which are orders of magnitude smaller. The hydraulic conductivity is a parameter at the so-called Darcy scale (see Chapter 8), namely a scale somewhere intermediate between the Newtonian viscosity(orNavier–Stokes)scaleforwaterandairinsidethesoilpores,ontheonehand, and the field scales for infiltration and drainage, on the other. Several spatial scales are illustrated with the corresponding characteristic temporal scales in Figure 1.2 for some general types of water transport processes as they have been considered in hydrologic studies. On the land surfaces of the Earth, the catchment or river basin sizes appear as scales of central importance.

In meteorology, the concern is more on atmospheric motions and weather systems, and this has led to a somewhat different scale classification; an example of a commonly used classification is shown in Table 1.5.

Rather, it is more useful to determine what scales are appropriate for the available and measurable data, and for the problem at hand. In other words, what is the appropriate level of parameterization? Spatial variability and effective parameters As mentioned above, a parameterization can be defined as a functional relationship between the variables describing the phenomenon in question. This relationship invari- ably contains one or more constant terms, reflecting material and fluid properties and vegetational, geomorphic, geologic and other physiographic features; these are called parameters and they are normally determined by experiment. Most hydrologic parame- terstendtobehighlyvariableinspace.Itstandstoreason,therefore,thattheexperimental determination of any such space-dependent parameter must be carried out at the scale at which it is to be applied to describe the flow. A second important issue is that any given parameterization is usually valid only over a certain finite range of spatial scales, and that the computational scale, that is the integration domain or the discretization of the equations, must lie within that range. Because the necessary data may be available only at a coarser resolution, in practical application a parameterization may have to be applied at scales, for which it was not intended originally and which are larger than permissible. This means in such a case that the spatial variability of the parameters at the finer scales, which is normally present in the natural environment, cannot be accounted for with the available data. This difficulty is often resolved by assuming that the parameterization is still valid at the larger scale, and that it can be implemented with averaged or values of the parameters. effective This approach is not always satisfactory, and it is still the subject of intense research. Some aspects of this issue related to land surface–atmosphere interactions are discussed elsewhere (Brutsaert, 1998).

This implies that the choice of parameterization depends on the spatial scale of the phenomenon being studied."}, {"question": "What is the challenge in applying parameterizations at scales for which they were not originally intended?", "answer": "The challenge in applying parameterizations at larger scales than intended is that the spatial variability of the parameters at finer scales cannot be accounted for with the available data. This often leads to the assumption that the parameterization is still valid at the larger scale, which may not always be satisfactory. Researchers and modelers must carefully consider the implications of this assumption and strive for more accurate representations of spatial variability."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, why is validation of a parameterization crucial?", "answer": "Validation of a parameterization is crucial because it ensures that the parameterization can give a faithful description of the phenomenon in question.

This step is essential for building trust in the model's predictions and for making informed decisions based on those predictions."}, {"question": "How do the concepts of parsimony and robustness relate to the development of parameterizations in hydrology?", "answer": "The concepts of parsimony and robustness are fundamental to the development of parameterizations in hydrology. Parsimony encourages the development of simple, yet effective parameterizations that capture the essential features of the phenomenon with minimal complexity. Robustness ensures that the parameterization is insensitive to errors and uncertainties, providing reliable predictions across a range of conditions. By balancing these two requirements, hydrologists can develop parameterizations that are both accurate and practical for application in various contexts."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the catchment or river basin scale in hydrologic studies?", "answer": "The catchment or river basin scale is significant because it represents a natural conveyance system for mass and energy on the land surfaces of the Earth.

Understanding the hydrologic processes at this scale is crucial for managing water resources and predicting the impacts of environmental changes."}, {"question": "How do different spatial scales influence the description of hydrologic phenomena?", "answer": "Different spatial scales influence the description of hydrologic phenomena by requiring different levels of detail and parameterizations. For example, the description of infiltration and drainage processes may require a finer scale than the description of catchment-scale hydrology. The choice of scale depends on the objectives of the study, the available data, and the complexity of the phenomenon being studied. By considering multiple scales, hydrologists can develop a more comprehensive understanding of hydrologic processes and their interactions."}]}

The thickness of this layer, which is the total liquid equivalent of water vapor in the atmospheric column at a given location, is also called the water, . precipitable W However, this quantity of water vapor is not distributed uniformly and it can greatly vary over a wide range of scales in space and in time. For instance, the water vapor content of the atmosphere, just like the temperature, generally tends to decrease with increasing latitude. Available data (Randel al., 1996) show that the precipitable water is more likely to be well below 5 mm near the Poles, and close to 50 mm near the Equator. But this is not always the case; even at similar latitudes there can be huge regional variations, the most extreme example being the warm dry deserts of the world. Most of the atmospheric water vapor is found relatively close to the ground, and at any given location water vapor decreases sharply with height; typically, about half the total water vapor in the atmospheric column can be found below a height of 1 or 2 km. Because the global annual evaporation is around 1 m, the average atmospheric residence time of water vapor is only about 9 days. This time scale governs the hydrologic interactions and water transfers between the atmosphere and the other two compartments of the global system, the oceans and the continents. This time scale is especially fundamental to the transport of atmospheric water vapor from its source regions–mainlyevaporationfromtheoceans–tosinksinprecipitatingweathersystems. Indeed, the excess precipitation on the continents, which does not evaporate, ultimately runsofftotheseasandoceansoftheworld.Abalanceismaintainedintheglobalsystem by the fact that over the oceans the situation is reversed and that evaporation is generally larger than precipitation, allowing the excess oceanic water vapor to be transported back water aloft to the continents. This transport of water from the oceans to the land areas, also called advection, takes place mostly in the form of water vapor and not as clouds; actually, in the atmosphere the total amount of water in the liquid and ice phases is less than 0.5% of the water in the vapor phase. But beside its central role in the hydrologic cycle, water vapor strongly affects other aspects of the Earth’s weather and climate as well. It is one of the main agents in the overall energy budget of the atmosphere in a number of ways. Globally, as seen in Table 1.4, the phase changes from liquid and solid to vapor are the main energy transfer mechanisms from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere; the subsequent condensation of this vapor in the air furnishes a large portion of the energy needed for the circula- tion of the atmosphere. Thus, the large-scale transport of water vapor as latent heat is one of the main redistribution mechanisms for the uneven radiative input from the Sun. In addition, the concentration and spatial distribution of the atmospheric water vapor are major factors controlling the amount and type of cloud, which in turn determine the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Finally, as the most abundant greenhouse gas, water vapor absorbs and thus “traps” terrestrial infrared radiative energy, and then re-emits it at a lower temperature.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of global water vapor distribution, how does the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere vary with latitude?", "answer": "The water vapor content of the atmosphere generally tends to decrease with increasing latitude, with precipitable water being more likely to be well below 5 mm near the Poles and close to 50 mm near the Equator.

An unstable atmosphere is subject to more intense mixing and turbulencethananeutralone;thisalsoresultsinlargerturbulenttransport.Undercertain conditions an unstable atmosphere will even give rise to various types of organized motions, with scales ranging from mere local updrafts and dust devils to large tropical storms. The atmosphere is often stable when the air is being cooled from below. This typically occurs at night under clear skies, when the surface is cooled by outgoing long- wave radiation or when relatively warm air flows over a relatively colder lake or ocean surface in spring. In addition, stable conditions, also called inversions, may result from larger-scaleweatherpatterns,whenrelativelywarmerairmassesmoveovercolderlayers. Not surprisingly, stable conditions have the opposite effect of unstable conditions. Thus mixing and turbulence are suppressed, and atmospheric transport is normally smaller. Under extreme conditions, the turbulence may be eliminated altogether and the flow of the air may be laminar. Such conditions are sometimes visible in the evening of a calm sunny day, around sunset, when the air near the ground becomes chilly and the smoke from a chimney can be seen moving slowly through the tree tops of a forest. On a somewhat larger scale, as a result of the reduced turbulence and dispersion, inversion conditions also tend to aggravate pollution problems in populated areas. Potential temperature To repeat briefly, during small displacements, parcels of air undergo adiabatic tempera- ture changes in accordance with Equation (2.22). In a perfectly neutral atmosphere the lapse rate of the atmosphere is also ; therefore under such conditions a displaced parcelwill,onaverageatleast,alwaysbesurroundedbyairatthesametemperatureand, as a result, there is no net exchange of heat. This means that even though there is a verti- cal temperature difference under neutral conditions, the heat flux is zero; consequently, water aloft the temperature used in heat transfer formulations should be corrected to account for that fact. This can be done by using the potential temperature instead of the actual temperatureT. The potential temperature is the temperature that would result if air were brought adiabatically to a standard pressure level 1000 hPa; for such a process yield Poisson’s equation θ = /p)Rd T(p (2.23) which can serve to define the potential temperature and also to calculate it for a given pressure and temperature T; note that in Equation (2.23) is replaced by for convenience. During an adiabatic process the potential temperature is conserved and therefore under perfectly neutral conditions in a dry atmosphere, or when the specific humidity is constant with height, the potential temperature should be a constant. A dry atmosphere is unstable when decreases, and stable when it increases with height. Nev- ertheless, the difference between and is usually rather small, especially in the lower layers of the air near the ground surface, where most measurements are made. Therefore in many situations, when the height difference of the temperature measurements is only a few meters, the use of the actual temperature is allowed; otherwise must be used in heat transfer formulations.

Under some conditions this can be an maybeincorporatedintheanalysisbymeansofthevirtualpotentialtemperature,definedas in the same way the virtual temperature is related to the actual temperature, as indicated in Equation (2.10).

Similarly, a parcel that moves downward will be colder and heavier, leading to a continued downward movement. This behavior amplifies displacements both upward and downward, contributing to the instability of the atmosphere."}, {"question": "Why do unstable atmospheric conditions typically occur, and what are their implications?", "answer": "Unstable conditions typically occur when the atmosphere is being heated from below, such as through solar radiation on clear days or when cold air moves over a warmer surface. This instability leads to more intense mixing and turbulence, resulting in larger turbulent transport. Under certain conditions, unstable atmospheres can even give rise to organized motions like updrafts, dust devils, or large tropical storms.

It is defined as the temperature that would result if air were brought adiabatically to a standard pressure level of 1000 hPa. The potential temperature, denoted by θ, can be calculated using Poisson's equation: θ = T(p/p0)^(Rd/cp), where T is the actual temperature, p is the pressure, p0 is the standard pressure, Rd is the gas constant for dry air, and cp is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.

The reduced turbulence and mixing under stable conditions lead to less dispersion of pollutants, causing them to accumulate near the ground. This can significantly worsen air quality, posing health risks to the population. The understanding of atmospheric stability and its effects on pollution dispersion is crucial for managing and mitigating pollution issues in urban and industrial areas."}]}

{"paragraph": "2.2.3 Conditional instability It often happens that the actual lapse rate in the atmosphere is intermediate between the dry and the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, that is ; this case is referred to as conditional instability. When a partly saturated parcel of air is raised in such an atmo- sphere, it will initially change its temperature at the dry adiabatic rate in accordance with Equation (2.8), and thus remain colder than the surroundings (see Figure 2.4). water aloft This situation is still stable. However, if the particle is made to rise further, and con- tinues to cool down, it may reach the level , where condensation takes place; above the condensation level it will change its temperature at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. If the rise continues, eventually above the levelz the temperature of the particle will exceed that of the surroundings; the rising air is now lighter than its surroundings, and an unstable situation has been established. The air, which was originally forced to rise, will now take off by free convection and continue to rise without any outside agent. The height is the free convection level. Thus whether or not a vertical displacement results in instability depends largely on the moisture content of the atmosphere.

{"paragraph": "2.3 TURBULENT TRANSPORT OF WATER VAPOR The flow of the atmosphere is almost invariably turbulent. In a turbulent flow molecular diffusion can usually be neglected, and water vapor is moved from one place to another by advective transport, that is, by being linked to the motions of the air that contains it. One exception, when molecular diffusion may be of some consequence, occurs near a wall where the no slip condition reduces the velocity of the moving air to zero and the turbulence is largely suppressed.

Turbulent flux of water vapor In turbulent flow the detailed description of the velocity field and also the temperature, the content of water vapor, or other admixtures of the air, at any given point in time and space, is practically impossible and it can only be accomplished in a statistical sense. The simplest and probably most important statistic is the mean. Accordingly, ever since Reynolds introduced the idea, it has been common practice in the analysis of turbulent flow phenomena to decompose the relevant variables into a mean and a turbulent fluctuation, namely etc. F F F u u q q turbulent transport of water vapor After applying the customary time averaging over a suitable time period, one obtains from Equation (2.25) for the mean flux components of water vapor u(cid:5)q(cid:5)) The first terms on the right of these three equations represent the advective transport of water vapor by the mean motion of the air. The second terms are the components of the advectivevaportransportbytheturbulence;theyarealsooftencalledtheReynoldsfluxes, and statistically speaking, they are covariances. The estimation and parameterization of these flux components is one of the core problems of hydrology.

In princi- ple, it should be possible to solve Equation (2.27) with appropriate boundary conditions to describe water vapor transport in the atmosphere. However, this equation presents several difficulties, which make its solution extremely difficult. First, since the fluxes in (2.26) are intrinsically dependent on the velocity of the air and the turbulence, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the flow and to include the conservation equations for momen- tum and temperature in the solution process as well.

Such conditions are rare, and the properties of most natural landsurfaces are spatially quite variable; fortunately,inmanysituationsofinteresttheycanbeconsideredtobeatleaststatistically be used to describe the flow. More generally (2.28) is tantamount to assuming that, as the air moves parallel to a homogeneous surface, on average (in the turbulence sense) the concentration of any property or admixture advected by the air changes only in the vertical and remains constant in the horizontal direction. The fact that the mean concentrations change only vertically is evidence that there is a source or a sink of the admixture at the surface, and thus the only turbulent fluxes of consequence are the vertical components. In the case of humidity with mean concentration (per unit mass of bulk air) q, Equations (2.26) are thus effectively reduced to = ρ w(cid:5)q(cid:5) in which henceforth the overbar on is omitted for convenience of notation. While mathematically Equations (2.26) and (2.29) are unambiguous, a more intu- itive sense of their physical significance can be obtained by considering the mechanism sketched in Figure 2.5. A particle of air, which undergoes a vertical velocity fluctuation w(cid:5), w(cid:5)δt travels a distance during a time interval After that air parcel has risen a w(cid:5)δt small distance from a level, where the mean specific humidity is q, it has a specific humidity which is larger than the mean of its new environment; thus the rate (distance per unit time) at which this particular parcel transports absolute humidity upward is (cid:5)w(cid:5)) times its volume.

Similar expressions can be written for the fluxes of other properties or admixtures of theflow.Theverticalfluxcomponentofhorizontalmomentum,withmeanconcentration = ρw(cid:5)u(cid:5) and that of sensible heat, with mean concentration can be written as = ρc w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) Under steady conditions in the lowest few meters of the air above a uniform surface, on account of continuity the inflow rate equals the outflow rate, which means that these vertical fluxes must be constant with elevation.

In the atmosphere, under conditions not very different from neutral, the outer region is affected both by the pressure gradients, reflecting larger scale weather patterns, and by the Coriolis forces, reflecting the effect of the rotation of the Earth. Under unstable conditions, the effects of the pressure and Coriolis forces are relatively small, and the outer region is more characterized by thermal convective turbulence; the outer region may then be referred to as the or the layer. The upper limit mixed layer convection of the unstable boundary layer is typically indicated by a sharp inversion, that is, a layer of stable air. Over land, the thickness of the boundary layer tends to vary in the course of the day. Consider for instance a typical evolution at mid-latitudes, in the absence of rapidly changing weather with passing fronts or precipitation activity. As stable conditions develop during the night, the boundary layer may range from a few tens of meters in the evening to about 500 m by early morning; then after sunrise, a new unstable boundary layer develops which may eventually reach a thickness of 1–2 km at full maturity by the middle of the day. This evolution is sketched in Figure 2.7. Figure 2.8 shows an example of the evolution of the temperature profile in the course of a sunny day. As a rule of thumb, the thickness of a typical boundary layer can be assumed to be of the order of 1 km; it is usually larger under unstable than under neutral conditions. The thickness of the atmospheric surface layer (or ASL) is usually taken as the lower one tenth of the boundary layer.

The surface sublayer is also sometimes assumed to be the layer where the vertical turbulent fluxes do not change appreciably from their value at the surface, say less than 10%. Although the ASL occupies the lower part of the turbulent boundary layer, it does not extend all the way down to the surface. As illustrated in Figure 2.6, the height of the lower limit of the ASL can be assumed to be of the order of in the case of smooth flow, and of the order of 3 to 5h in the case of rough flow; is the characteristic height of the roughness obstacles. In general, under non-neutral conditions the air flow and the momentum transport are greatly affected by the transport of sensible heat and, to a lesser extent, water vapor, and vice versa.

Therefore, it is practicallyalwaysnecessarytoincludetheeffectofthestability,i.e.thedensitystratification, of the atmosphere in the formulation of the profile equations and of the corresponding transfer coefficients. One of the more common ways of doing this is based on the Monin– Obukhov (1954) approach, which assumes that the effect of the density stratification of the flow can be represented by the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy, resulting from the work of the buoyancy forces; it can be shown (see Monin and Yaglom, 1971; Brutsaert, 1982) that near the ground this rate is given by in common. Accordingly one can hypothesize that in a stratified turbulent flow any dimensionless characteristic of the turbulence depend only on the following: the height and the turbulent energy production rate by the buoyancy. These four quantities, which can be expressed in terms of three basic dimensions, viz. time, length and air mass, can be combined into one dimensionless variable. This variable, which was proposed by Monin and Obukhov (1954) (originally for 0), is where is known as the Obukhov stability length, defined by in which is a mean reference temperature (in K) of the air near the ground and the subscript 0 refers to near-surface values of the fluxes, so that by definition these fluxes represent and respectively. In the original formulation of the turbulent water vapor flux term did not appear; although in many cases the effect of the water vapor on the density stratification can be neglected, it is still is advisable to include it whenever possible. With this hypothesis the dimensionless gradients of the mean wind, of the temperature and of the humidity, can be written as − = φ (ζ) w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) − = φ (ζ) w(cid:5)q(cid:5) turbulence similarity in which the subscripts m, h and v refer to momentum, sensible heat and water vapor, respectively.

However, the resulting cover only certain ranges, corresponding ζ-range, to these sublayers.

Bulk ABL similarity formulation As mentioned, the atmospheric surface layer typically occupies only the lowest 10% or so of the boundary layer.

The basic form of the equations is essentially aloft above the surface layer. Ideas on the application of similarity to the entire ABL, including the outer region were put forth early on by Rossby and Montgomery (1935) and Lettau (1959), and subsequent developments can be traced through the work of Kazanski (2000), among others. The various versions of this approach can be written in a general form as follows, w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) θ −θ = −d )/z s b b 0 0h where and arefunctionsofanumberofdimensionlessvariablesthataffecttransport intheouterregionandwherethesubscriptbindicatesbulkorcharacteristicscalevariablesof theABL.Thush denotesacharacteristicthicknessorheightscaleoftheABL;thevariables and arecharacteristichorizontalwindvelocitycomponentsinthex-andy-directions, respectively (x is the direction of the near-surface wind; because it may involve the Earth’s rotation,usually pointstotheleftof intheNorthernHemisphere,andtotherightinthe Southern Hemisphere), such that , in which is a characteristic wind speed aloft. These bulk variables have been given different definitions in the past, depending on the specific implementation of the approach. In the early applications and were taken as the values of these variables near the top of the ABL, in general, or just below the capping inversion, under unstable conditions. water aloft Wind speed (m = 1.05m, Exampleofawindprofilemeasuredabovemoderatelyhillyprairieterrain(z0 Fig.2.15 = 26.9m)inKansasat1500CDTonAugust14,1987,bymeansofaradiosonde;thecircles representthewindspeed,andthetrianglesandsquaresrepresentthex-andy-componentsof thewindvelocity,respectively.Thearrowindicatestheheightoftheinversion.(FromBrutsaert andSugita,1991). The more recent implementations (see, for example, Brutsaert, 1999) have been mostly for unstable conditions with mean values of the variables in the mixed layer, and with the wind speed as a scalar. The rationale for this choice of bulk variables is that, indeed, as illustrated in Figure 2.15, owing to convection with vertical mixing the y-component of the velocity is nearly negligible, so that the x-component is practically equal to the wind speed; moreover, wind speed measurements aloft can be noisy, so that a height-averaged value is likely to be more robust. Figure 2.16 shows the corresponding temperature profile. Thus, with this choice of variables, the formulation for momentum and sensible heat can be written as V ] (2.67) m i 0 0 w w(cid:5)θ(cid:5) [ln((h (2.68) s m i 0 0h inwhich and arethemeanwindspeedandpotentialtemperature,respectively,inthe mixed layer of the unstable ABL; is the height of the top of the mixed layer, that is the bottom of the inversion above the ground, and has been given a subscript w to indicate that the wind speed is used, instead of the wind velocity components and turbulence similarity Fig.2.16 Exampleoftheprofileofpotentialtemperaturemeasuredwiththesameradiosondeasthatof thewindshowninFigure2.15.Thesolidcircleshowsthemedianvalueofthesurface temperature.Thearrowindicatestheheightoftheinversion.(FromBrutsaertandSugita, Untilnow,nogeneraldefinitiveformhasbeenderivedforthesefunctions and C.An exampleofaformulationforunstableconditions,thathasproducedgoodresults(Brutsaert, 1999), is summarized in what follows. It is based on the assumption of an ABL consisting and above it a mixed layer as a slab with uniform profiles; it is further also based on the assumption explained behind (2.64) regarding the position of the top of the surface layer, where it meets the mixed layer. For moderately rough terrain, i.e. when )h , the resulting functions are w t m t i 0 m 0 t h t i 0 h 0h For very rough terrain, when )h , the functions are ln((h (z w i 0 t 0 m t 0 m 0 ln((h (z i 0 t 0 h t 0 h 0h Thesimilarityfunctions and givenbyEquations(2.69)and(2.70)areillustratedin Figures 2.17 and 2.18. In the derivation of Equations (2.69) and (2.70) it was assumed that the outer region is a perfectly mixed slab layer; this assumption has its limitations. In fact, water aloft 0 100 200 300 400 –(h – d )/L Fig.2.17 Dependenceofthebulksimilarityfunction thelattervaluesareshownasnumbersatthecorrespondingcurves.Thecurvesfor [(hi [(hi areobtainedwithEquation (2.69),andthosefor (2.70);itisassumedthatα = 0.12and β = areobtainedwithEquation 120. under unstable conditions the potential temperature often tends to increase slightly with elevation,roughlyfromaboutthemiddleofthemixedlayer(e.g.Figures2.8and2.16);this is mostly the result of entrainment of warmer air into the ABL from above. Similarly the wind speed is often affected by this entrainment. Therefore, in the practical application oftheseequations,itmaybeadvisabletoobtainthemeanwindandtemperaturedifference from measurements over the lower half of the mixed layer, that is below (h in order to minimize any possible entrainment effects. The temperature difference term in Equation (2.68) has the lower value at the surface. As in (2.51), the lower value can also be taken at some level in the surface layer; the proper formulation for this case can be obtained by simply subtracting (2.55) from (2.66) or (2.68), so that is eliminated. As a further alternative, an example of the application of the bulk ABL similarity approach with the lower value not at the surface, but at shelter level, has been presented by Qualls (1993). The bulk ABL similarity approach (also called BAS), as formulated here for unstable conditions, has several features which make it attractive to obtain surface fluxes and from soundings in the upper reaches of the boundary layer. First, the mixed layer variables and , which are averages over the mixed layer, are more robust than the profiles u(z) and such profiles often tend to be erratic and noisy. Second, since these mixed layer variables are averages over a layer extending roughly between heights of the order of 100 m and 1 km above the ground, they reflect mean surface conditions over upwind distances of the order of 1–10 km; this provides the main justification and appeal of this approach to describe surface fluxes at the mesogamma scale (see Table 1.5), which is often the relevant spatial scale for hydrologic catchments.

For many practical purposes, the energy budget equation can be written as R L E H L F G A n e p p h surface boundary condition In words, Equation (2.72) states that the difference between incoming and outgoing energy fluxes is equal to the rate of increase of the energy stored in the layer under consideration; the sign convention is such that the energy fluxes toward the layer are taken as positive and those away from it as negative.

Figure 2.19 shows the terms in an irrigated environment under clear sky in the summer. Figure 2.20a illustrates the response of the turbulent heat fluxes in response to varying cloudiness in the course of a spring day, whereas Figure 2.20b shows a typical clear sky situation, which is generally similar to Figure 2.19. In contrast to what happens over land, Figure 2.21 shows how over deep water the turbulent heat fluxes and do not follow the diurnal cycle of the solar radiative energy supply; as a result of the large heat capacity of the water body, the surface temperature tends to remain more constant, and less affected by the radiative energy input.

However, the sensible heat flux does not increase in a steady manner as one might expect if the available energy were constant.

In the event that suitable data are not available, it may be necessary to make an estimate by means of one of several theoretical models or simpler empirical formulae that relate short-wave radiation with other physical factors, such as extraterrestrial radiation, optical air mass, turbidity, water vapor content of the air, amount and type of cloud cover. However, these should be used with caution. A simple equation which can be used for daily averages, was proposed by Prescott (1940) in terms of daily total extraterrestrial radiation as follows [a (2.74) where and are constants which depend on the location, the season and the state of the atmosphere; their values have been determined for many locations and on average they appear to be around 0.25 and 0.50. In Equation (2.74) is the actual number of hours of bright sunshine and the number of daylight hours; as a first approximation for steady weather conditions can be related to the mean fractional cloud cover by a(n/N)+bm = 1 (2.75) in which and are different constants, for which values averaging around 1.1 and 0.85, respectively, have been observed in the Netherlands and in Japan (e.g. De Vries, 1955; Kondo, 1967). Manyotherregressionequationslike(2.74),alsoforinstantaneousvalues ,havebeen proposed in the literature, but such simple equations can be only poor substitutes for direct measurements. Nevertheless, it is possible to obtain fairly accurate radiation estimates by betterempiricalandpartlytheoreticalmethods,whichare,however,moredifficulttoapply. Examples of such methods, which can give useful results, are those presented by among Becausesuchapproachesoftenrelyontheextraterrestrialradiation,itisappropriatetotake a quick look at it. Extraterrestrial radiation The extraterrestrial radiation can readily be calculated for a given latitude, time of day and day of the year from the solar constant. For a horizontal surface, instantaneous values can be calculated from = /d )2cosβ (d (2.76) se so so s in which is the zenith angle, that is the angular distance between the sun and the vertical, and in which and are the instantaneous distance and the annual mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, respectively; however, and differ by at most 3.5%, so that this effect is often neglected in hydrologic applications. It can be readily shown that the zenith angle can be calculated as follows cosβ = cosφcoshcosδ +sinφsinδ where is the latitude and is the hour angle, such that its origin 0 is local noon or 1200, and 24 h The angle is the solar declination, that is the angular distance of the Sun north (or south when negative) of the Equator.

The declination is usually determined as a function of day of the year (see Paltridge and Platt, 1976; Liou, 2002). Figure 2.23 gives an idea of the variability of thedailytotalsofsolarradiation ;theEarthisclosesttotheSuninthemonthofJanuary, so that the curves are somewhat asymmetric between North and South, with the maximal radiation occurring in the South. Surface albedo This is the ratio of the global short-wave reflected radiative flux and the flux of the corresponding incident radiation; in contrast to the term reflectivity, the albedo also includes the diffuse portion of the radiation. In energy budget studies the albedo usually refers to an integral value over all wave lengths; however, sometimes, to distinguish it from the spectral albedo, it is called the integral albedo. In the case of an ideal rough surface, the albedo should be independent of the direction of the primary beam. For most natural surfaces the fraction of directly and diffusely reflected radiation depends on the direction of the incoming beam. Therefore, on days with sunshine, the albedo of most surfaces depends on the altitude of the Sun, but this dependence decreases with increasing cloudiness. For example, for water surfaces it appears that the albedo can be represented well by a power function of the solar altitude (see Anderson, 1954; Payne, 1972). The albedos of other surfaces obey similar relationships. However, for daily totals it is common practice to use a mean value of the albedo. Table 2.7 presents a brief summary of mean albedo values for various surfaces obtained from summaries Budyko, 1974) Long-wave or terrestrial radiation Also sometimes called nocturnal radiation, this is the radiant flux resulting from the emission of the atmospheric gases and the land and water surfaces of the Earth. All materials on Earth and around it have a much lower temperature than the Sun, so that the radiation they emit has much longer wavelengths than the global radiation. There is practically no overlap, since most of the radiation emitted by the Earth is contained in the range from 4 to 100 Long-wave radiation can be measured, but the needed measurements for a particular area of interest are rarely available, so that it must often be calculated from other measurements. It is convenient to consider two components of the terrestrial radiation at the Earth’s surface separately, namely a component of upward radiation from the surface , and that of downward radiation from the atmosphere . The upward component is usually obtained by assuming that the ground, the canopy orthewatersurfaceunderconsiderationisequivalentwithaninfinitelydeepgreybodyof uniform temperature and emissivity which is close to unity.

Moreover, since is rarely known, for daily or longer averages over land, Equation (2.79) is often applied by using the air temperature instead of the surface temperature .

Such data are not always available wherethelong-waveradiationisneeded;asaresultsimplermethodshavebeendeveloped that rely on readily available measurements, such as air temperature and humidity near the ground.

Several expressions have been proposed for this emissivity. Most of these are strictly empirical, but it is also possible to derive from physical considerations. In one such derivation (Brutsaert, 1975; 1982), the equation for radiative transfer in a plane stratified atmosphere is solved by assuming first, a simple power function slab emissivity, and second, a near-Standard Atmosphere to obtain the temperature and humidity profiles. With typical average values of the parameters, the resulting atmospheric emissivity can be written as a(e (2.81) = = 1/7, where and are constants; these were derived to be 1.24 and when the vapor pressure of the air is in hPa mb) and is in K.

{"paragraph": "2.6.2 The energy flux at the lower boundary of the layer The nature of and the optimal method of its determination depend on the type of substrate layer to which the energy budget equation is applied. For a thin layer of soil, for a vegetational canopy or for a whole lake or stream, the term in Equation (2.72) represents the heat flux into the ground. For a water surface, is the heat flux into the underlying water body. Over land covered with vegetation the daily mean value of G, that is the ground heat flux, is often one or more orders of magnitude smaller than the major terms in the energy budget, and E. The main reason for this is that positive daytime values of (warming) often tend to be compensated by negative nighttime values (cooling). Therefore, in design calculations, the daily values of are often neglected. Measurement of the soil heat flux Several methods are available to determine for a landsurface (see Brutsaert, 1982), but a detailed review is beyond the scope of this book. One of the more reliable methods to measure considers changes in heat storage in the upper layer of the soil, as described by the equation (z) (2.83) Q Q C dz where and are the heat flux densities at levels and , respectively, is the Q Q z z C H1 H2 1 2 s volumetric heat capacity of the soil and is the temperature in the soil.

If the depth is large enough, can be assumed to be negligible; if it is not sufficiently large to allow this assumption, the heat flux must be determined. In the so-called combination method, suggested by C. B. Tanner of Wisconsin, is measured by means of a heat flux plate placed at a depth of 5–10 cm below the surface. The integral in Equation (2.83) is then determined from suc- cessive temperature profile measurements above the level of the heat flux plate (see also Hanks and Tanner, 1972). Empirically based methods to estimate the soil heat flux Whennecessarymeasurementsarenotavailable,thesurfacesoilheatfluxmaybeestimated on the basis of empirical relationships.

From available experimental observations, it appears that on average for bare soil can be given a value around 0.3 (see, for exam- Figure 2.26); however, for any given soil it can be expected to vary with moisture content. For surfaces covered with vegetation will normally be smaller and it will depend not only on the soil moisture state of the soil but also on the type of vegetation; for example, a value of 0.2 has been measured for maize (Perrier, 1975), and most measurements for grass have yielded values around 0.1.

In the case of tall vegetation, however, it may have to be considered; for example, it has been observed (Stewart and Thom, 1973) that this term can be especially significant after sunrise and near sunset, when it may be of the same order of magnitude as the net radiation . Still, on a daily basis it can be safely neglected.

For instance, the flux of CO2 can be up to 8% of the latent heat flux under favorable conditions. However, on a daily basis, these terms can generally be safely neglected due to their minimal contribution to the overall energy budget."}, {"question": "How does the advected energy term impact the energy budget of different hydrological systems, such as lakes and snow covers?", "answer": "The advected energy term, which comprises all energy changes resulting from water flowing in or out of the system, can significantly impact the energy budget of lakes and snow covers. For lakes, advection by river flows may need to be considered, especially for shallow lakes. In contrast, for snow covers, the advected energy term is generally important as it includes the energy used in fusion, as formulated in Equation (2.72). Additionally, precipitation, such as rainfall or snowfall, can also be a source of advection, affecting the energy balance of these systems."}, {"question": "In the context of tall vegetation, how does the energy advection term compare to the net radiation term, and why is it significant?", "answer": "In the case of tall vegetation, the energy advection term can be especially significant after sunrise and near sunset, when it may be of the same order of magnitude as the net radiation. This is because the advected energy term includes the energy changes resulting from water flowing in or out of the system, which can be substantial in areas with dense vegetation. The significance of this term lies in its potential to impact the energy budget of the system, particularly during periods of high photosynthetic activity."}, {"question": "What is the role of precipitation in the energy budget of hydrological systems, and how does it affect the advected energy term?", "answer": "Precipitation, such as rainfall or snowfall, acts as a source of advection in the energy budget of hydrological systems. It can affect the energy balance of systems like snow covers and lakes, particularly in cases where the precipitation is significant. The advected energy term, which includes the energy changes resulting from precipitation, can be important in these systems, especially when the precipitation is substantial."}, {"question": "Why is the energy advection term generally important in the case of a snow pack, and what does it include?", "answer": "The energy advection term is generally important in the case of a snow pack because it includes the energy used in fusion, as formulated in Equation (2.72). This term comprises all the energy changes resulting from water flowing in or out of the system, which can be substantial in snow packs due to the energy required for fusion.

This method allows for the estimation of the energy changes resulting from water flowing in or out of the lake, which is essential for understanding the lake's energy budget. The accuracy of this method depends on the frequency and quality of the surveys, as well as the lake's hydrological characteristics."}, {"question": "How does the Bowen ratio method contribute to estimating the fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor in hydrological systems?", "answer": "The Bowen ratio method, as mentioned in Equation (4.11), can be used to estimate the fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor in hydrological systems. This method is based on the energy budget approach and allows for the calculation of these fluxes by considering the energy balance of the system. By using this method, researchers can gain insights into the dynamics of carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes in various hydrological systems."}, {"question": "Why can the energy absorption by photosynthesis be neglected in most hydrological applications, despite its potential importance under certain conditions?", "answer": "The energy absorption by photosynthesis can be neglected in most hydrological applications because its contribution to the overall energy budget is relatively small.

Also shown are the radiative flux values at the top of the atmosphere and their attenuation on their way down. It can be seen that globally the net radiation at the Earth’s surface is 104 W m which is also roughly equal to the sum of the sensible and latent turbulent heat fluxes E. The evaporative flux is shown to be 85 W m because 1 W m produces an evaporation rate of roughly 1.07 mm of water per month, this is equivalent with an annual evaporation of 1.09 m, which agrees with the values listed in Table 1.1. If it is assumed that there is no global warming (or cooling), the sum of the incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere must also be zero. The ratio of the outgoing and incoming short- wave radiation shows that the average albedo of the Earth–atmosphere system for extra- terrestrial radiation is of the order of 0.3. Globally, the atmosphere is being warmed by the short-wave radiation at a rate of 342 169 25 96 W however, the rate of − − = −200 net long-wave radiation input into the atmosphere is 385 345 240 W which results in a cooling. Thus the net cooling rate of the global atmosphere due to radiation is 200 104 W m and this is balanced by the energy input into the atmosphere by the surface turbulent heat fluxes E. The energy fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, as shown in Figure2.28,werederivedwiththeconstraintthattheywouldexhibitaperfectlybalanced steady state. In fact, the separately measured fluxes do not exhibit a perfect balance, but the discrepancy is only of the order of a few W m the issue continues to be the subject of intense investigations.

This is beneficial for mitigating the impact of pollution on the environment and public health. The mixing also allows for a more efficient exchange of pollutants with cleaner air masses, further aiding in their dispersion."}, {"question": "How does the mean horizontal wind velocity in an unstable atmosphere compare to that in a neutral atmosphere on a regional scale?", "answer": "The mean horizontal wind velocity in an unstable atmosphere is larger than that in a neutral atmosphere on a regional scale. This difference is significant because it influences weather patterns, the distribution of heat and moisture, and the overall climate of a region. Understanding these differences is crucial for predicting weather and climate phenomena accurately."}, {"question": "In what scenario is an unstable atmosphere likely to be found, as described in the paragraph?", "answer": "An unstable atmosphere is likely to be found over a deep lake in the spring when warm air blows over the water. This scenario occurs because the warm air moving over the cooler water surface creates a temperature gradient that leads to instability in the atmosphere. This instability can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation, affecting local weather conditions."}, {"question": "Why does an unstable atmosphere not cause turbulence to be damped?", "answer": "The paragraph does not explicitly state why an unstable atmosphere does not cause turbulence to be damped, but it implies that an unstable atmosphere is associated with increased mixing and turbulence, contrary to the damping of turbulence. This suggests that the characteristics of an unstable atmosphere, such as the vertical profile of wind velocity and the presence of temperature gradients, contribute to the generation and maintenance of turbulence rather than its damping."}, {"question": "How does the dispersion of pollutants in an unstable atmosphere impact environmental and public health?", "answer": "The dispersion of pollutants in an unstable atmosphere has a positive impact on both environmental and public health by reducing the concentration of pollutants in any one area. This reduction minimizes the adverse effects of pollution on ecosystems and human populations. However, it's also important to consider that while dispersion reduces local concentrations, it can also lead to the spread of pollutants over wider areas, potentially affecting larger ecosystems and populations. Therefore, managing pollution requires a comprehensive approach that includes reducing emissions and strategically managing dispersion to minimize overall environmental and health impacts."}, {"question": "In the context of atmospheric conditions, what is the relationship between atmospheric stability and the vertical profile of horizontal wind velocity?", "answer": "The relationship between atmospheric stability and the vertical profile of horizontal wind velocity is such that an unstable atmosphere results in a more uniform vertical profile of the horizontal wind velocity compared to a stable atmosphere. This relationship is crucial for understanding atmospheric dynamics and predicting weather patterns, as the profile of wind velocity influences the movement of air masses, the formation of clouds, and the distribution of precipitation."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the characteristics of an unstable atmosphere important for hydrological and environmental studies?", "answer": "Understanding the characteristics of an unstable atmosphere is important for hydrological and environmental studies because it helps in predicting precipitation patterns, runoff, and the dispersion of pollutants. An unstable atmosphere can lead to increased precipitation, which affects runoff and water availability, influencing hydrological cycles and water resource management. Moreover, the dispersion of pollutants in an unstable atmosphere has significant implications for environmental quality and public health, making it essential to consider atmospheric stability in environmental and hydrological assessments."}, {"question": "How does the scenario of warm air blowing over a deep lake in the spring relate to atmospheric stability?", "answer": "The scenario of warm air blowing over a deep lake in the spring is related to atmospheric stability because it creates a condition favorable for the development of an unstable atmosphere. The temperature difference between the warm air and the cooler water surface initiates convection, leading to the mixing of air and the creation of an unstable atmospheric condition. This instability can result in the formation of clouds, precipitation, and the dispersion of pollutants, highlighting the importance of considering such scenarios in the context of atmospheric stability and its environmental impacts."}, {"question": "What are the implications of an unstable atmosphere for regional climate and weather patterns?", "answer": "The implications of an unstable atmosphere for regional climate and weather patterns are significant, as it can lead to increased precipitation, altered wind patterns, and changes in temperature distributions.

This situation typically occurs at night or in areas where there is minimal wind activity, allowing the Earth's surface to cool more efficiently through long-wave radiation. As a result, the air near the surface cools, and since warm air is less dense than cool air, this cooling effect leads to a more stable atmospheric condition."}, {"question": "In the context of surface conditions, how do stable atmospheric conditions relate to the formation of dew?", "answer": "Stable atmospheric conditions are more likely to be accompanied by dew (negative evaporation) than unstable conditions over land. This is because stable conditions often lead to cooler surface temperatures, especially at night, which can cause the air near the surface to reach its dew point, resulting in dew formation. The relationship between stable conditions and dew formation is significant because it highlights the importance of atmospheric stability in influencing surface hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What is the implication of stable atmospheric conditions over an extensive and deep-water body in early spring under a cloudy sky?", "answer": "The implication of stable atmospheric conditions over an extensive and deep-water body in early spring under a cloudy sky, when warm air moves over the water, is that these conditions would be expected. This is because the warm air moving over the cooler water body creates a temperature gradient that leads to stable atmospheric conditions. This situation is significant in the context of hydrology because it can influence evaporation rates, water temperature, and other hydrological processes in the water body."}, {"question": "In the context of thunderstorm activity, what can be inferred about the likelihood of such events under stable atmospheric conditions?", "answer": "Under stable atmospheric conditions, there is a low likelihood for thunderstorm activity. This is because thunderstorms typically require unstable atmospheric conditions to form, characterized by significant vertical motion and mixing of air.

{"paragraph": "3.1.1 Mechanisms Several processes take place jointly in the formation of precipitation. In brief, these are the production of supersaturation of the air, condensation of water vapor into ice crystals and droplets, the subsequent growth of these condensation products, and the supply of moist air to where the first three processes occur. These processes involve a number of different mechanisms, which are briefly reviewed in what follows. Cooling of the air As indicated in the previous chapter, the water-holding capacity of air decreases, as its temperaturedecreases.Thus,aircanbecomesupersaturatedbybeingcooleddown.Such cooling can occur by advection, for instance, as warmer air moves over a colder surface, byradiativecoolingoralsoasaresultofthemixingoftwodifferentairmasses;butthese aregenerallynotveryeffectivemechanismsandonlycapableatmostoffogformationor light drizzle. A more effective mechanism of cooling of the air consists of its being lifted to higher elevations; in the generation of precipitation this is by far the main mechanism. Air can be forced to rise by being heated from below, by moving over mountainous terrain, or by frontal activity, that is by having to move over relatively heavier, that is colder air. When the vertical air motions are relatively weak and gentle, for example in the case of stable air in a warm front, the lifting may result in what is referred to as precipitation. On the other hand, when the air is already unstable, and the stratiform vertical motions are relatively strong, the resulting precipitation tends to be of the so- called type. Under certain conditions the movement of air over mountainous convective terrain can involve a combination of both stratiform and convective precipitation. precipitation Condensation and growth of condensation products Whentheairreachesorexceedssaturation,watervapormaystarttocondenseintheform ofliquiddropsoricecrystalsonthesmallnuclei,suchasdust,smokeandvarioustypesof salt particles, that are invariably present in the atmosphere. Initially, these condensation products are small enough to be kept afloat in the atmosphere as cloud. Condensation generates latent heat. Therefore, any further growth of these droplets and ice crystals depends on the rate of diffusion of water vapor to their surface from the surrounding air and on the rate of conduction of latent heat away from their surface into the air; in the case of liquid droplets, there are also hygroscopic effects due to some nuclei, surface tension and for the larger sizes, accretion. It can be shown (see, for example, Fleagle and Businger, 1963) that the growth of droplets is primarily controlled by condensation up to radius sizes of the order of 15 Full-grown raindrop development to radii larger than 20 requires accretion by collisions and coalescence with neighboring drops of different sizes and fall velocities; this process, in turn, is affected by the turbulence of the air, the temperature distribution in the clouds and electrical effects. In contrast, the growth of ice particles depends only on vapor diffusion and on heat removal, and not on accretion; however, on account of the lower vapor pressure characteristics of ice, the watervapordiffusionprocessismuchmoreeffectivethaninthecaseofliquidwater.Ifthe particle sizes continue to increase, eventually they become too heavy and precipitation takesplace.Theonsetofprecipitationonthegrounddependsonanumberofconditions; most obvious among them is that the condensation products must be large enough to fall down against the entrainment of updrafts, and to overcome evaporation while falling down to the ground. A rough rule of thumb for the demarcation between precipitation and cloud particle diameters is around 0.1 mm. Substantial rates of precipitation usually can take place only when the cloud thickness is 1200 m or more. Blanchard (1972) has written an enlightening history of the discovery of the main mechanisms of raindrop and ice crystal formation. Moisture supply Calculation of the precipitable water, as defined in Equation (2.11), shows that even under the most favorable conditions an atmospheric column at rest can hold only a very limited quantity of water vapor. For instance (List, 1971), for a near-surface temperature of 20 and a surface pressure of about 1000 hPa, a saturated atmosphere with a pseudoadiabatic lapse rate can at most hold an amount, which is equivalent with about 5 cm of liquid water; for 10 this precipitable water is only about half as much.

This meansthatitisnotsomuchthelocalprecipitablewater,butthehorizontalinfluxofmoist air into an area, that controls the local intensity and the total amount of precipitation. The specific nature of this moisture influx depends on the weather system.

Table 3.1 shows some estimates for a few regions of the world. Recycling of precipitation, or lack thereof, resulting from the soil moisture conditions can be a strong feedback mechanism leading to persistence of weather and climate patterns.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the formation of precipitation, what are the primary processes involved?", "answer": "The primary processes involved in the formation of precipitation include the production of supersaturation of the air, condensation of water vapor into ice crystals and droplets, the subsequent growth of these condensation products, and the supply of moist air to where the first three processes occur."}, {"question": "Why does the cooling of air lead to the formation of precipitation?", "answer": "The cooling of air leads to the formation of precipitation because as the air cools, its water-holding capacity decreases, allowing it to become supersaturated. This supersaturation is a critical step in the formation of precipitation, as it enables the condensation of water vapor into droplets or ice crystals. The cooling can occur through various mechanisms, including advection, radiative cooling, or the mixing of different air masses, but the most effective mechanism is the lifting of air to higher elevations."}, {"question": "How does the growth of condensation products depend on the surrounding air conditions?", "answer": "The growth of condensation products, such as droplets and ice crystals, depends on the rate of diffusion of water vapor to their surface from the surrounding air and the rate of conduction of latent heat away from their surface into the air. For liquid droplets, additional factors such as hygroscopic effects, surface tension, and accretion also play a role. The growth of droplets is primarily controlled by condensation up to a certain radius size, after which accretion by collisions and coalescence with neighboring drops becomes more important."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation formation, what is the role of moisture supply from outside a region?", "answer": "Moisture supply from outside a region plays a crucial role in precipitation formation, as it can contribute significantly to the total amount of precipitation. Even under favorable conditions, the local atmospheric column can hold only a limited quantity of water vapor, and heavy precipitation amounts often exceed this capacity. The horizontal influx of moist air into an area, rather than the local precipitable water, controls the local intensity and total amount of precipitation."}, {"question": "Why is water recycling important in the study of regional water budgets?", "answer": "Water recycling is important in the study of regional water budgets because it helps to determine the origin of the water vapor producing precipitation. By estimating the recycling ratio, researchers can understand the proportion of precipitation that results from evaporation within the region versus outside the region. This information is essential for understanding the regional water cycle and the feedback mechanisms that lead to persistence of weather and climate patterns."}, {"question": "How does the size of condensation products affect their ability to fall as precipitation?", "answer": "The size of condensation products, such as droplets and ice crystals, affects their ability to fall as precipitation because larger particles are more likely to overcome the entrainment of updrafts and evaporation while falling to the ground. A rough rule of thumb is that particles with diameters greater than 0.1 mm can fall as precipitation, and substantial rates of precipitation usually require cloud thicknesses of 1200 m or more."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation formation, what is the difference between stratiform and convective precipitation?", "answer": "Stratiform precipitation occurs when the vertical air motions are relatively weak and gentle, resulting in a more uniform distribution of precipitation. Convective precipitation, on the other hand, occurs when the air is unstable and the stratiform vertical motions are relatively strong, leading to more intense and localized precipitation. The type of precipitation that forms depends on the stability of the air and the strength of the vertical motions."}, {"question": "Why is the humidity of the air relatively constant during precipitation events?", "answer": "The humidity of the air remains relatively constant during precipitation events because the local precipitable water is supplemented by the horizontal influx of moist air into the area. This influx of moist air helps to maintain the humidity levels, even as precipitation occurs, allowing for the continuation of precipitation events."}, {"question": "How does the mechanism of cooling affect the type of precipitation that forms?", "answer": "The mechanism of cooling affects the type of precipitation that forms because different cooling mechanisms can lead to different types of precipitation. For example, the lifting of air to higher elevations can result in precipitation, while the mixing of different air masses can lead to fog formation or light drizzle. The strength and nature of the cooling mechanism influence the stability of the air and the resulting type of precipitation."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the precipitable water in understanding precipitation formation?", "answer": "The precipitable water is significant in understanding precipitation formation because it represents the maximum amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can hold. Even under favorable conditions, the local atmospheric column can hold only a limited quantity of water vapor, and heavy precipitation amounts often exceed this capacity. Understanding the precipitable water helps researchers to appreciate the importance of moisture supply from outside a region in contributing to precipitation formation."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.1.2 Types of precipitation Precipitation can reach the ground surface in different forms. is a very light, usually uniform, precipitation consisting of numerous minute droplets with diameters in excess of 0.1 mm but smaller than is precipitation consisting of water drops larger than 0.5 mm. It can be classified as light rain when the intensity is smaller than 2.5 mm mod- erate when it is between 2.5 and 7.5 mm and heavy when it exceeds is precipitation in the form mainly of branched hexagonal or star-like ice crystals, resulting from direct reverse sublimation of the atmospheric water vapor; snow particles can reach the ground as single crystals, but more often than not they do so after agglomerating as snowflakes. These flakes tend to be larger at temperatures close to freezing. The specific gravity of snow can vary over a wide range (Judson and Doesken, 2000), but as a rule of thumb for fresh snow it is often taken around 0.1. (North American usage) is precipitation consisting of fairly transparent pellets or grains of ice, formed as a result of the passage of raindrops through a layer of colder air near the ground. In British usage the word sleet refers to precipitation consisting of melting snow or a mixture of snow and or freezing rain is ice deposited by drizzle or rain on cold surfaces. precipitation (also called or graupel) are a form of precipitation Snow pellets granular snow consisting of white, opaque, small grains with diameters between roughly 0.5 and 5 mm.

These ice crystals can assume a wide variety of shapes.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of precipitation types, what forms of precipitation are mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "The paragraph mentions several forms of precipitation, including light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, graupel, small hail, soft hail, and dew."}, {"question": "How does the formation of snowflakes occur, and what affects their size?", "answer": "Snowflakes form through the agglomeration of single ice crystals, and their size tends to be larger at temperatures close to freezing. This process involves the direct reverse sublimation of atmospheric water vapor into ice crystals, which then combine to form snowflakes. The specific conditions under which snowflakes form, such as temperature and humidity, can influence their size and structure."}, {"question": "In the context of ice precipitation, why does hail usually fall during violent and prolonged convective storms?", "answer": "Hail usually falls during violent and prolonged convective storms because these storms provide the necessary conditions for hail formation, including updrafts that carry water droplets up into freezing levels of the atmosphere, where they freeze into small balls of ice. As these balls of ice are carried upward and downward through the storm, they may pass through additional layers of supercooled water droplets, which freeze onto the hailstones, increasing their size. The violent and prolonged nature of these storms allows for the repeated cycling of hailstones through these layers, resulting in larger hailstones that can cause severe damage."}, {"question": "What is the difference between dew and hoar frost, and how do they form?", "answer": "Dew and hoar frost are both forms of moisture that form on surfaces through the direct condensation of atmospheric water vapor. However, dew forms as liquid drops, typically at night on surfaces that have been cooled by outgoing long-wave radiation, whereas hoar frost forms directly into ice crystals. The formation of dew and hoar frost depends on the temperature and humidity conditions, with dew forming when the air temperature is above freezing and hoar frost forming when the air temperature is below freezing."}, {"question": "How does the specific gravity of snow vary, and what is a common rule of thumb for fresh snow?", "answer": "The specific gravity of snow can vary over a wide range, but as a rule of thumb for fresh snow, it is often taken to be around 0.1. This variation in specific gravity is due to factors such as the size and shape of the snowflakes, the amount of air trapped between the flakes, and the degree of compaction of the snow."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation classification, why is the intensity of rain used to classify it as light, moderate, or heavy?", "answer": "The intensity of rain is used to classify it as light, moderate, or heavy because it provides a measure of the amount of rainfall per unit time, which is an important factor in determining the impact of the rainfall on the environment and human activities. Light rain, with an intensity smaller than 2.5 mm, may have minimal impact, while moderate rain, with an intensity between 2.5 and 7.5 mm, may start to have noticeable effects, and heavy rain, with an intensity exceeding 7.5 mm, can have significant impacts, including flooding and erosion."}, {"question": "What is the difference between small hail and soft hail, and how do they form?", "answer": "Small hail and soft hail are both forms of precipitation that consist of small, rounded grains of ice, but they differ in their appearance and durability. Small hail is typically white, semitransparent, or translucent, with a glazed appearance, while soft hail is softer in appearance and tends to disintegrate more easily. Both forms of hail are thought to form through the freezing of supercooled water droplets in clouds, but the exact mechanisms of their formation are not fully understood."}, {"question": "How does the formation of sleet differ from that of freezing rain, and what are the implications for surface conditions?", "answer": "Sleet forms when raindrops pass through a layer of cold air near the ground, causing them to freeze into small, transparent ice pellets, whereas freezing rain forms when supercooled raindrops freeze onto surfaces, forming a layer of clear ice. The implications of these different formation mechanisms are significant, as sleet tends to bounce off surfaces, while freezing rain forms a smooth, transparent layer of ice that can be extremely slippery and hazardous."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological processes, why is it important to understand the different types of precipitation?", "answer": "Understanding the different types of precipitation is important because each type has distinct characteristics and effects on the environment and human activities.

{"paragraph": "3.2.1 Extratropical cyclones and fronts Thesetypesofsystemsnormallyresultfromtheinteractionoftwocontrastingairmasses. An air mass can be defined as a body of air with approximately uniform physical char- acteristics such as (potential) temperature and humidity. The interface between two different air masses is called a when relatively colder air displaces and moves cold front beneath relatively warmer air, and a in the opposite case. Cold fronts tend warm front to be relatively steep, with average slopes on the order of 0.015; in the Northern Hemi- sphere they are often oriented from the southwest to the northeast and move toward the east and southeast. An approaching cold front is usually announced by increasing wind speedsandtheappearanceofaltocumulusclouds(Figure3.1).Allthewhilethepressure decreases, and lower clouds, mainly of the cumulonimbus type, move in with the onset of precipitation. As the front comes closer the precipitation intensity increases. After the passage of the front the pressure rapidly rises and the temperature falls sharply; the wind direction changes, typically from a southerly or southwesterly direction to a more west- erly or northerly direction. Cold fronts are often followed by drier and cooler weather. The stability of the warm air mass determines the type of precipitation generated by a cold front. If the warm air is stable the clouds are of the stratiform type. The clouds are major precipitation weather systems Fig.3.1 Crosssectionofatypical coldfront.(Verticalscale isexaggerated.) Warm air Cold air Fig.3.2 Crosssectionofa typicalwarmfront. Warm air Cold air of the cumuliform type and the precipitation convective (see Section 3.2.2), if the warm air is conditionally unstable (see Figure 3.1). In this case, scattered thunderstorms and showers may develop, and in extreme cases the front may evolve into a continuous line of thunderstorms, called a line. Warm fronts are usually not as steep, with slopes that are on average of the order of 0.01; they also move more slowly than cold fronts, and are not as well defined. As the warm air moves over the cold air a broad band of clouds develops (Figure 3.2), extending up to several hundreds of kilometers ahead of the front’s position on the ground.Alsointhecaseofawarmfront,itisthestabilityofthewarmairthatdetermines the type of precipitation produced by the front. When the warm air in the approaching frontal air mass is moist and stable, the sequence of cloud types is cirrus, cirrostratus, altostratus, and nimbostratus, and the precipitation increases gradually. When the air is moist and conditionally unstable, the same sequence may occur, but altocumulus and cumulonimbus, often with thunderstorms, will also be observed. The interface between contrasting air masses tends to be unstable and it often evolves further, through the rotation of the Earth, into a spiraling stream called a cyclone. A cyclone is a large low-pressure zone, and it is usually accompanied by cloud systems and precipitation. An anti-cyclone is the opposite case, namely a high-pressure zone, which usually brings fair weather; it is also normally characterized by subsidence, a slow downward air motion resulting from the horizontal divergence of the air away from the pressure high.

In the initial stage the winds on both sides of a stationary front are blowing in parallel but opposite directions. As a result of the shear and small disturbances, surface roughness or heating irregularities, the front may gradually assume a wave-like shape, which may persist and increase in amplitude, and eventually evolve into a counterclock- wise (in the Northern Hemisphere) flow pattern, called a wave. By now there is a well-defined cold front and a warm front, and the cyclonic circulation continues to intensify. The cold front section usually moves faster and eventually overtakes the warm front. At this point, which is the time of maximal intensity of the cyclone, the combined front is referred to as an or an front. In the later stages of occlusion occluded the occlusion, the intensity of the cyclone and the frontal movement gradually decrease; finally the occlusion vanishes while a new stationary front may be formed. Observe that, in contrast to the cold and warm fronts sketched in Figures 3.1 and 3.2, those shown in Figure 3.4 are assumed to involve a stable warm air mass, so that the clouds shown are of the stratiform type. Many different factors control the evolution of occluded fronts. It has been shown (Stoelinga al., 2002) that, more than the temperature contrasts, it is the stability contrasts across the fronts which govern the dynamics of occlusions. precipitation Frontal cyclones dominate the weather in the mid- and high latitudes, mainly in the colder season, when the contrasts between the equatorial and the polar regions are the most pronounced.

This seasonal variation has implications for regional climate patterns, agricultural planning, and water resource management, as it influences the frequency and intensity of precipitation events."}, {"question": "In the context of occluded fronts, what factors control their evolution?", "answer": "The evolution of occluded fronts is controlled by several factors, with stability contrasts across the fronts being more significant than temperature contrasts in governing the dynamics of occlusions.

{"paragraph": "3.2.2 Extratropical convective weather Unstable atmospheric conditions have the potential of generating organized systems of convective quasi-vortical movement of air, over a wide range of scales. Recall that an ideal vortex is a flow in which the streamlines are concentric circles. In the atmosphere, however, convective systems are considerably more complex than an inverted bathtub vortex.Undertherightmoistureconditionsoftheatmosphere,thesesystemscandevelop into thunderstorms, and may consist of a single storm cell, or of several cells as part of a mesoscale convective system. The spatial extent of these systems tends to cover mainly the mesobeta into the mesoalpha scales, typically ranging from about 50 to 500 km, but individualcellscanbeassmallasonlyafewkilometers.Individualcellsarecharacterized by strong local updrafts and downdrafts. Simply put, the updrafts are a manifestation of theunstableconditionsoftheair(seeFigures2.2and2.4)andleadtocondensationinthe cooling air resulting in precipitation. The downdrafts, on the other hand, result not only fromtheentrainmentbyfallingprecipitationandsomeevaporativecooling,butalsofrom return flows required by continuity to compensate for the upward motions (Vonnegut, 1997); some of these are produced after updrafts reach their highest level and then fall back as downward currents. Most systems of this type are accompanied by a specific surface pressure pattern, first described by Fujita (1955) from time-to-space conversion of barograph data. In brief, this pattern consists of a high-pressure zone or mesohigh, trailed by a low-pressure zone, also called a or low. Some of the mesodepression wake mechanisms involved have subsequently been further elucidated (see Johnson, 2001) and are sketched in Figures 3.6 and 3.7. It is generally believed that the high pressure is a result of evaporative cooling in precipitation downdrafts below cloud base; additional effects may be caused by the impinging of the downdrafts on the ground, causing a pressure nose, and by hydrometeor loading. Williams (1963) showed that the observed pressuredeficitcouldbetheresultofadescending,orsubsiding,drycurrenttotherearof the convective air, but the causes for this remain unclear. The nose, also known as a cold air outflow leading edge or gust front, often assumes the form of a surge; some 20 cases have been studied with a 461 m tower by Goff (1976) (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9), which indicatethattheyhavesomefeaturesincommonwiththeopenchannelsurgesdiscussed in Chapter 7 (see also Simpson, 1997).

In contrast, during the winter months, the winds blow from land to sea, resulting in a dry season. This seasonal cycle is characteristic of monsoon regions and has significant implications for water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems."}, {"question": "What is the role of topographic features in enhancing precipitation in regions where seasonal tropical systems and monsoon winds interact?", "answer": "Topographic features, such as mountains and hills, play a crucial role in enhancing precipitation in regions where seasonal tropical systems and monsoon winds interact. As warm, moist air is forced to rise over these features, it cools and condenses, resulting in heavy precipitation. This process is known as orographic lift, and it can significantly enhance precipitation amounts in regions where it occurs. The interaction between seasonal tropical systems, monsoon winds, and topographic features can result in some of the highest precipitation amounts on record, as seen in regions such as Meghalaya in India."}, {"question": "In regions where monsoons occur, why is the wet-dry season cycle important for water resources and ecosystems?", "answer": "The wet-dry season cycle associated with monsoons is important for water resources and ecosystems because it has significant implications for the availability of water throughout the year. During the wet season, the heavy precipitation can replenish water sources, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater, which can then be used during the dry season. However, the dry season can also lead to water scarcity, which can have negative impacts on ecosystems and human populations. Understanding and managing the wet-dry season cycle is therefore crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems and ensuring the sustainable use of water resources."}, {"question": "How do seasonal tropical systems and monsoons interact to produce extreme precipitation events, and what are the implications for flooding and landslides?", "answer": "Seasonal tropical systems and monsoons can interact to produce extreme precipitation events, such as heavy rainfall and flash flooding, due to the combination of deep convection and orographic lift. The heavy precipitation can result in flooding and landslides, which can have devastating impacts on human populations and ecosystems. The implications of these events are significant, as they can lead to loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and disruption of ecosystems. Understanding the interaction between seasonal tropical systems and monsoons is therefore crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of extreme precipitation events."}]}

{"paragraph": "3.2.5 Orographic effects The precipitation resulting from each of the general weather types discussed here can be markedly affected by topographic features, such as elevation, slope and aspect of the land surface. The result tends to be increased precipitation on windward slopes, and smaller precipitation on leeward slopes, also called rain shadows. In some regions with identifiable prevailing wind directions, such as the coastal ranges of western North America or the foothills of Meghalaya in eastern India, the windward slopes can be readily identified. On the other hand, as noted by Gilman (1964), in the Appalachian mountains, the windward and leeward sides can be quite variable, depending on the wind direction. Smith (1979) specified that there are three independent mechanisms of orographic precipitation, as follows. (i) Large-scale upslope precipitation, which is generated by forced vertical motion of the stratiform type or by triggered convection as theairmovesoverrisingterrain.(ii)Small-scaleredistributionofprecipitationfrompre- existing clouds by small hills; over the hill tops the precipitation is increased, because their higher surface can intercept the falling drops before they evaporate, and apparently also because the drops undergo increased accretion by washout of low-level clouds. (iii) Generation of upslope winds in a conditionally unstable air mass as a result of slope heating by the Sun; these develop into rising thermals, which in turn can grow into cumulonimbus clouds above the lifting condensation level. In general, because there are several other factors beside elevation, the effect of orog- raphy by itself in causing increased precipitation is not always obvious; physically, its maineffectisasatriggermechanismforconvectiveactivity.Accordingly,asobservedby Suzukietal.(2002),therelationshipbetweenprecipitationandelevationisusuallymore pronounced for convective than for stratiform rainfall. The relationship is also stronger andmoreapparentforlargeraccumulatedrainfallamounts,forlongeraccumulationtime scales, and for larger rainfall intensities. For instance, in the analysis of hourly rainfall data, the random effects of other factors may dominate the measured precipitation, so that the effect of topography may go undetected. With daily rainfall data topographic effects gradually emerge, albeit with large variations from one day to the next. With monthly data the effects of the other factors tend to become averaged out and the effect of elevation is more apparent. Numerous studies reviewed by Daly al. (1994) have reportedlinearrelationshipsbetweenprecipitationandelevation,butotherrelationships, such as loglinear functions have also been documented. In the mid-latitudes the climato- logical precipitation maxima tend to occur at or near the crest of mountainous barriers. However, in warmer regions (e.g. Hawaii), or in large-scale precipitation events (e.g. the Sierras in California) the maximal precipitation may occur somewhat lower, ahead major precipitation weather systems Fig.3.10 Moistairpassingoverrisingterrainmayresultinadownslopewindwhichiswarmeranddrier.The T (solidline)andspecifichumidityq graphontherightshowsthechangesintemperature (dashed z;thelapserateofthesolidlinesegmentsABandCDisverycloseto line)ofaparcelofairwithheight dryadiabatic,andthatofthesegmentBCisclosetosaturatedadiabatic.Theheight isthe condensationlevel,whereprecipitationstartsandtherateoftemperaturedecreasechangesfromdry adiabatictosaturatedadiabatic. of the topographic barrier; this may be due to upwind “rainout.” On the other hand, in some situations of steep and narrow mountain ridges, the precipitation maxima may be delayed, and may occur downwind from the crest of the barrier. Example 3.1. Passage over mountain barriers In the previous chapter the concepts of adiabatic lapse rate and the resulting atmospheric stability were in introduced. Figure 2.4 illustrates how air, which is initially stable, can be made unstable by being forced to rise. This is called conditional instability. As another illustration, consider this time an air mass that is forced to rise by moving over rising terrain, as sketched in Figure 3.10. Again, initially the temperature of an air parcel will decrease at a rate roughly equal to the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Above the condensation level this rate will become smaller, and roughly equal to the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. As the saturated air continues to rise, it cools further down and its moisturegraduallyprecipitatesout.Afteritpassesthepeak,andgoesbackdown,through its descent the air warms up at the dry adiabatic lapse rate and gradually becomes less and less saturated. Finally, after its passage downwind from the mountain the air is both warmer and drier than it was originally upwind. This type of phenomenon is variously referred to as F¨ in the Alpine regions of Europe, in southern California ohn Santa Ana and east of the Rocky Mountains of North America. Again, as was the case with frontal systems, when the entire incoming air mass is initially stable and moves precipitation Fig.3.11 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofthe Thiessenpolygonmethod toestimatethesubareas assignedtothe precipitationgagesonthe mapofacatchment.The subareasareboundedby theboundariesofthe catchmentandbythe linesdrawnmidway betweenthestations.The locationsofthestations areindicatedbythe numberedcircles. uniformly over the rising terrain, the resulting precipitation can be expected to be of the stratiform type. However, in situations when the incoming air is already unstable, much higher convective type precipitation intensities develop; this may be especially the case with irregular topography and uneven surface heating, when some parts of the air mass have higher temperatures than others at the same height, so that locally the convection mechanisms, as illustrated in Figure 2.4, come into play.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of orographic effects on precipitation, what are the primary factors that influence the distribution of precipitation over windward and leeward slopes?", "answer": "The primary factors include elevation, slope, and aspect of the land surface, leading to increased precipitation on windward slopes and smaller precipitation on leeward slopes, also known as rain shadows.

{"paragraph": "3.3.1 Spatial distribution Areal average from precipitation gages In hydrologic analyses at the basin- or catchment-scale, the input is of necessity taken as the average precipitation over the entire area. Different weighting methods have been used in the past to estimate this average from the available precipitation gage network. When no other information is available, the only possible method is to take the regular average value, i.e. the mean, with equal weights assigned to all gage stations. arithmetic When the locations of the stations are known on a map, the method Thiessen polygon (Thiessen, 1911) has been commonly used. Here each gage represents a subarea, , which is determined as the area bounded by the perpendicular bisectrices between the station and those surrounding it (see Figure 3.11); the spatial average is calculated by weighting the individual stations with their representative area, namely (cid:3)P(cid:4) precipitation distribution on the ground 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 23 24 21 22 25 Fig.3.12 Sketchillustratingtheapplicationoftheinversedistancemethod.Forexample,theprecipitationover (cid:3) (cid:3) subarea17isdeterminedas .Theaverageprecipitationovertheentire i,17 i,17 catchmentisthenobtainedastheweightedaverageofallsubareavalues,asshowninEquation(3.2). Thelocationsofthestationsareindicatedbythenumberedcircles. where is the number of rain gage stations in the area, and is the surface area of the catchment, that is the sum of the subareas, or . The method is equally simple in principle, but it is easier to imple- inverse distance ment. It is based on the assumption that the precipitation at any given point is influenced by all stations in the area, each weighted by the inverse of a power of its distance from the point. Note, as an aside, that the principle can also be used to calculate missing data. To obtain the areal average, the method is applied by subdividing the area into rectangular subareas, each with an assumed uniform precipitation as calculated for the point at its center; the resulting mean precipitation is then (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3)P(cid:4) j=1 i=1 i=1 in which is the surface area of the jth subarea, is the total surface area of the catchment,and nthetotalnumberofprecipitationstations; isthedistanceofthecenter of the jth subarea from the ith rain gage in the catchment and is a constant, which in most applications has been taken as 2. It can be seen that, for 0, Equation (3.2) produces the arithmetic mean. Dean and Snyder (1977) found that 2 yielded the best results in the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, whereas Simanton and Osborn (1980) concluded from measurements in Arizona that can range between 1 and 3 without significantly affecting the results. Figure 3.12 illustrates the application of this method. precipitation Fig.3.13 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofthe isohyetalmethodto estimatetheaverage precipitationovera catchment.The subareasAi arebounded bytheisohyetsandby theboundariesofthe catchment.Thelocations ofthestationsare indicatedbythe numberedcircles.

Many more methods have been proposed in the literature. Although they can be quite different in principle, a comparison of 13 of them has shown (Singh and Chowdhury, 1986) that over longer, say monthly or annual, periods they all produce comparable results; the shorter the time period, the more they can be expected to produce different results. Objective analysis The simple averaging methods just described are fairly arbitrary in their design and not based on well-defined criteria. However advances, in what is variously called objective analysis geostatistics namely the estimator, also known as kriging. This is a weighting best linear unbiased procedure, in which the weights are determined on the basis of the spatial structure of the rainfall fluctuations, and on the basis of the dual criteria that the estimation error, i.e. differencebetweentheestimatedvalueandthetruebutunknownvalue,atanypointbezero on average, and that the corresponding mean square error be minimal. For details on the application of this method the reader is referred to the specialized literature. Complex and mountainous terrain poses some additional challenges in the estimation of the precipitation distribution and its mapping. Attempts have been made to incorporate precipitation distribution on the ground orographic effects in objective analysis in the derivation of areal averages (Chua and Bras, elevationdata,includingheightandaspect,toderivelocalregressionequationswithwhich to distribute point measurements of monthly and annual precipitation to regularly spaced grid cells. Some distribution functions The areal distribution of precipitation over different time scales has been the subject of intensive research and numerous relationships have been proposed in the literature to reduce the estimated point precipitation, when it is to represent a larger area. In some of these, correlation studies were carried out relating the decay with increasing distance from a gage at a central location (Huff and Shipp, 1969; Hutchinson, 1969). For design purposes for use with point rainfall frequency data (and not with individual storms), in the United States the reduction factors shown graphically in Figure 3.14, developed by widely used. Various aspects of areal rainfall reduction procedures have subsequently of these investigations have shown that the reduction factor dependency on area is also a function of the severity, i.e. the return period of the event. However, it was also generally found that for several reasons the curves shown in Figure 3.14 are on the safe side, and therefore are likely to result in a more conservative design. Thus actual precipitation tends to decrease more rapidly with area covered, as the return period increases, than indicated in the figure; also, convective type storms exhibit a more rapid decrease with areathanthoseofthestratiformtype.Finally,althoughthereductionfactorsshowninthe figure appear to level off at around 1000 it has been found that in fact the reduction factor continues to decrease in an exponential manner as the area increases beyond that, even up to 20000", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic analyses at the basin- or catchment-scale, what method is commonly used to estimate the average precipitation over the entire area when the locations of the stations are known on a map?", "answer": "The Thiessen polygon method is commonly used, where each gage represents a subarea determined by the perpendicular bisectrices between the station and those surrounding it, and the spatial average is calculated by weighting the individual stations with their representative area."}, {"question": "How does the inverse distance method differ from the Thiessen polygon method in estimating areal average precipitation?", "answer": "The inverse distance method is based on the assumption that the precipitation at any given point is influenced by all stations in the area, each weighted by the inverse of a power of its distance from the point, whereas the Thiessen polygon method assigns weights based on the area represented by each station. This difference in weighting approach reflects distinct assumptions about how precipitation varies spatially."}, {"question": "Why do different methods for estimating areal average precipitation produce comparable results over longer periods but different results over shorter periods?", "answer": "Different methods produce comparable results over longer periods because the variability in precipitation averages out over time, reducing the impact of methodological differences. However, over shorter periods, the methods can produce different results due to the increased influence of local precipitation patterns and the specific weighting schemes used in each method. This discrepancy highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate method based on the time scale of interest."}, {"question": "In the context of objective analysis, what is the principle behind the kriging method for estimating areal average precipitation?", "answer": "The kriging method, also known as the best linear unbiased estimator, determines weights based on the spatial structure of the rainfall fluctuations and aims to minimize the mean square error of the estimation. This approach ensures that the estimation error is zero on average, providing a more robust and unbiased estimate of areal average precipitation compared to simpler averaging methods."}, {"question": "How do orographic effects and elevation data influence the estimation of precipitation distribution in complex and mountainous terrain?", "answer": "Incorporating orographic effects and elevation data into objective analysis can help derive more accurate local regression equations for distributing point measurements of precipitation to grid cells.

However, the complexity of these relationships poses challenges for modeling and analysis."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of areal rainfall reduction procedures, and how do they account for the severity of precipitation events?", "answer": "Areal rainfall reduction procedures aim to adjust point rainfall data to represent larger areas, considering the decay of precipitation intensity with increasing distance from a central gage. These procedures account for the severity of precipitation events by incorporating the return period of the event, recognizing that more severe events exhibit a more rapid decrease in intensity with area. This adjustment is crucial for design purposes, as it helps in estimating the actual precipitation over a larger area more accurately."}, {"question": "Why do reduction factors for areal rainfall decrease more rapidly with area for convective type storms compared to stratiform type storms?", "answer": "Convective storms exhibit a more rapid decrease in precipitation intensity with area because they are characterized by intense, localized precipitation cells. In contrast, stratiform storms tend to produce more uniform precipitation over larger areas. This difference in storm type affects the rate at which precipitation intensity decreases with area, necessitating the use of storm-type specific reduction factors in areal rainfall reduction procedures."}, {"question": "In the context of areal rainfall reduction, how do the curves shown in Figure 3.14 relate to actual precipitation patterns, and what implications does this have for design purposes?", "answer": "The curves shown in Figure 3.14 are considered to be on the safe side, meaning they likely result in a more conservative design. Actual precipitation tends to decrease more rapidly with area covered as the return period increases, and the reduction factor continues to decrease exponentially with area beyond 1000 km^2. This implies that designs based on these curves may overestimate actual precipitation for larger areas or more severe events, potentially leading to unnecessary conservatism in design decisions."}, {"question": "What challenges are posed by complex and mountainous terrain in the estimation of precipitation distribution, and how have researchers addressed these challenges?", "answer": "Complex and mountainous terrain poses significant challenges due to the strong influence of topography on precipitation patterns.

This generalization is based on the premise that if the underlying mechanisms driving rainfall patterns are similar, then the empirical relationships derived from data in one region can be applied, with adjustments, to predict rainfall intensity and duration in other regions with comparable mechanisms.

This consistency implies that while local conditions are important, there are underlying universal principles that govern rainfall patterns, making it possible to develop broadly applicable equations like the intensity-duration-frequency relationship.

Similarly, sparse forests also tend to have lower values of interception, namely around 10% to 20% of the precipitation (see Gash al., 1995; Valente al., 1997).

This is because the water held by the foliage elements evaporates before it can reach the ground, thus becoming unavailable for these processes. As a result, the amount of intercepted precipitation that returns to the atmosphere by evaporation is often referred to as the loss, highlighting its impact on the overall water balance."}, {"question": "Why do tall or dense vegetation tend to incur larger interception losses than short or sparse vegetation?", "answer": "Tall or dense vegetation tend to incur larger interception losses than short or sparse vegetation because they have more foliage elements that can hold and evaporate water. This increased surface area for interception leads to a greater amount of water being retained and eventually evaporated, rather than reaching the ground. Consequently, the type of vegetation plays a significant role in determining the magnitude of interception losses."}, {"question": "In the case of forested surfaces, what factors influence the magnitude of interception losses?", "answer": "The magnitude of interception losses in forested surfaces is influenced by both the type of vegetation and the type of precipitation.

This suggests that the interaction between vegetation characteristics and precipitation patterns is crucial in determining the extent of interception losses."}, {"question": "How do interception losses in different types of vegetation compare, and what are the implications for hydrologic processes?", "answer": "Interception losses vary significantly among different types of vegetation, with dense forests exhibiting the largest losses, often ranging from 30% to 40% of the gross precipitation. In contrast, sparse forests and heather or shrub-covered terrain tend to have lower interception losses, typically around 10% to 20% and less than one-third of the values in dense forests, respectively.

This prolonged exposure to precipitation enables the canopy to reach its full capacity, leading to increased evaporation and, consequently, larger interception losses. In contrast, short intense bursts and downpours may not allow the canopy to reach its full capacity, resulting in smaller interception losses relative to the total precipitation."}, {"question": "How does the process of interception affect the hydrologic budget, particularly in terms of infiltration and runoff?", "answer": "The process of interception affects the hydrologic budget by reducing the amount of water available for infiltration and runoff. By retaining water on the vegetation canopy, interception decreases the amount of precipitation that reaches the ground, thereby reducing the potential for infiltration into the soil and runoff over the surface. This reduction in water availability can have significant implications for groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and surface water flow."}, {"question": "What role does evaporation play in the process of interception, and how does it impact the water balance?", "answer": "Evaporation plays a crucial role in the process of interception, as it is the primary mechanism by which intercepted water is lost to the atmosphere.

This evaporation constitutes a significant component of the water balance, as it represents a loss of water that could otherwise contribute to groundwater recharge, soil moisture, or surface water flow."}, {"question": "In the context of different vegetation types, how do the characteristics of vegetation influence interception losses?", "answer": "The characteristics of vegetation, such as density and height, significantly influence interception losses. Dense and tall vegetation tend to have larger interception losses due to their increased surface area for interception, which allows for more water to be retained and evaporated. In contrast, sparse and short vegetation have smaller interception losses, as they have less surface area for interception and, consequently, less water is retained and evaporated."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.4.2 Interception loss mechanisms in vegetation For a single precipitation event the total interception loss is the sum of the evaporation from the wet vegetation during the event and the evaporation of the water remaining on the vegetation after the precipitation has ceased. Horton (1919) was probably the first to formulate this, for a storm duration D, which is long enough to saturate the vegetation, as where is the rate of evaporation of intercepted water and the interception storage capacity of the vegetation [L]. When the precipitation ceases before the vegetation interception Fig.3.18 Sketchillustratingthe waterbalanceofa vegetationcanopy. is fully saturated, the precipitation amount lost by interception is L E dt S in which is the amount of water stored on the partly saturated vegetation.

ToallowthepracticalimplementationofEquations(3.6)and(3.10),variousassumptions have been proposed by different authors, regarding c, , and O. The main difficulties in assessing these assumptions are the complexity of the vegetation cover precluding more thoroughanalysisandtheabsenceofexperimentalsupportformostoftheprocessesinvolved in interception. Some of these assumptions are briefly discussed in the following. Some common assumptions Thefractionalvegetationcover cisoftenassumedtobesimplyrelatedwiththefreethrough- fall coefficient p, as p); this coefficient is the portion of the precipitation that reaches the ground without hitting the canopy (Gash and Morton, 1978). Both and can be measured (see Section 3.4.3). The drainage rate has been estimated in various ways. The simplest way to describe it is with the assumption that as long as the canopy is partly saturated there is no drip, and that once it is saturated at the end of the storm the amount of water on the canopy rapidly falls to its storage capacity S (Gash, 1979; Noilhan and Planton, 1989). These can be written as 0 for (3.11) and, from Equation (3.8) 0 for (3.12) cP E O S S The rate of evaporation from the intercepting vegetation is the most critical but also the mostdifficultvariabletodetermine.Foroperationalpurposes,itisnowcommonly(Noilhan be estimated by means of a suitably chosen potential evaporation (see Chapter 4) from the fraction of the surface occupied by intercepting vegetation and that the evaporation from the remaining fraction can be ignored. For partly saturated surfaces during the wetting up phase of the interception process, it has mostly (see Rutter al., 1971) been assumed that the evaporation is proportional to the relative saturation ).

Both assumptions can be combined as )E (3.13) Themainproblemwiththeseunderlyingassumptionsisthatitisstillnotveryclearexactly how this potential evaporation should be defined or estimated; this issue will require fur- ther study. In any event, these assumptions lead now to the following expressions for the interception loss.

This equation accounts for the evaporation and the water stored on the vegetation, providing a more accurate estimate of the interception loss under these conditions."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to determine the rate of evaporation from the intercepting vegetation?", "answer": "The rate of evaporation from the intercepting vegetation is the most critical but also the most difficult variable to determine due to the complexity of the vegetation cover and the lack of experimental support for most of the processes involved in interception. This challenge arises because the evaporation rate depends on various factors, including the type of vegetation, its density, and the environmental conditions, making it hard to accurately estimate without thorough analysis and experimental data."}, {"question": "In what way can the lumped kinematic approach be applied to represent the vegetation as a hydrologic flow system?", "answer": "The lumped kinematic approach can be applied by assuming a simple relationship between the evaporation rate and the relative saturation of the vegetation, as given by Equation (3.13). This approach allows for the derivation of a closed-form solution for the evolution of the vegetation storage with time, enabling the estimation of the interception loss. By assuming constant or averaged values of the precipitation intensity and evaporation rate during the event, the time to saturation and the interception loss can be calculated using Equations (3.17) and (3.19), respectively."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions regarding the fractional vegetation cover, drainage rate, and evaporation rate affect the estimation of interception loss?", "answer": "The assumptions regarding the fractional vegetation cover, drainage rate, and evaporation rate significantly affect the estimation of interception loss. For instance, assuming the fractional vegetation cover is related to the free throughfall coefficient can simplify the calculation, but the accuracy depends on the validity of this assumption. Similarly, the choice of method to estimate the drainage rate and evaporation rate, such as assuming no drip until the canopy is saturated or using a potential evaporation approach, can impact the estimated interception loss. These assumptions must be carefully evaluated to ensure they are applicable to the specific vegetation and environmental conditions being studied."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the time to saturation in estimating the interception loss, and how can it be calculated?", "answer": "The time to saturation is crucial in estimating the interception loss because it determines whether the precipitation event is long enough to saturate the vegetation. If the event is shorter than the time to saturation, the interception loss is calculated using Equation (3.10), which accounts for the evaporation and storage during the event. The time to saturation can be calculated using Equation (3.17), which is derived from the lumped kinematic approach. This calculation is essential for accurately estimating the interception loss, as it allows for the distinction between short and long precipitation events."}, {"question": "In the context of stemflow and interception loss from trunks, why are the losses from trunks usually smaller than those from the leaves of the canopy?", "answer": "The losses from trunks are usually smaller than those from the leaves of the canopy because the evaporation from the trunks is very small compared to the evaporation from the canopy. This is due to the relatively small surface area of the trunks and the lower evaporation rates from the trunks. As a result, the total loss from the trunks consists mainly of the evaporation of the water remaining on the trunks after the end of stemflow, which is typically a smaller component of the total interception loss."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions about the potential evaporation and the fraction of the surface occupied by intercepting vegetation impact the estimation of interception loss?", "answer": "The assumptions about the potential evaporation and the fraction of the surface occupied by intercepting vegetation significantly impact the estimation of interception loss.

(1967) is commonly used to estimate the storage capacity."}, {"question": "How does the method proposed by Leyton et al. (1967) estimate the storage capacity, and what conditions must be met for its application?", "answer": "The method estimates the storage capacity by observing that the loss is equal to the canopy storage when evaporation is equal to zero. This method requires data points from events of sufficiently long duration to ensure that the canopy is fully saturated. The data points are then used to determine the intercept of the lower envelope with a slope of unity, which represents the events with minimal evaporation. This approach allows for the estimation of the storage capacity under conditions of negligible evaporation."}, {"question": "In the context of determining the free throughfall coefficient, why is it necessary to use throughfall measurements for small storms that are insufficient to saturate the canopy?", "answer": "Using throughfall measurements for small storms that are insufficient to saturate the canopy is necessary because it allows for the determination of the free throughfall coefficient. This coefficient can be obtained by analyzing throughfall data for small storms, as proposed by Gash and Morton (1978). By doing so, the canopy cover can then be obtained by assuming a relationship between the free throughfall coefficient and the canopy cover."}, {"question": "What are the typical values of the specific canopy storage capacity (S) and the free throughfall coefficient (c) for different types of vegetation, and how do these values vary?", "answer": "Typical values of S and c vary depending on the type of vegetation. For dense pine forest, S ranges from 0.8-1.2 mm and c ranges from 0.68-1.00. For sparse pine forest, S is around 0.64 mm and c is around 0.64. For eucalyptus forest, S is around 0.35 mm and c is around 0.60. For grasses, S values range between 0.43 and 2.8 mm. These values indicate that the storage capacity and free throughfall coefficient can vary significantly depending on the vegetation type."}, {"question": "How are the stemflow parameters determined, and what are the typical values for different types of vegetation?", "answer": "The stemflow parameters are determined as the mean slope and the intercept of the regression of stemflow versus precipitation for each tree on which measurements are made. Typical values for the stemflow parameters vary depending on the type of vegetation. For dense pine forest, the values range from 0.014-0.74 mm and 0.016-0.29. For sparse pine forest, the values are around 0.17 mm and 0.0275. For Amazonian forest, the values are around 0.15 mm and 0.036. These values indicate that the stemflow parameters can vary significantly depending on the vegetation type."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating the interception storage capacity, why is it essential to account for stemflow, and how is this typically done?", "answer": "Accounting for stemflow is essential because it can significantly affect the estimation of the interception storage capacity. Stemflow is typically accounted for by representing the vertical axis as (1-c)PD instead of PD. However, the difference is usually small and can be neglected. This approach allows for a more accurate estimation of the interception storage capacity by considering the role of stemflow in the overall water balance."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the method proposed by Leyton et al. (1967) for estimating the storage capacity, and how does it relate to the overall water balance?", "answer": "The method proposed by Leyton et al. (1967) has significant implications for estimating the storage capacity and understanding the overall water balance. By accurately estimating the storage capacity, this method allows for a better understanding of the interception loss and its impact on the water balance. This, in turn, can inform water management decisions and help mitigate the effects of droughts and floods. Furthermore, the method's ability to account for stemflow and evaporation makes it a valuable tool for understanding the complex interactions between vegetation, climate, and water resources."}, {"question": "How do the values of the specific canopy storage capacity (S) and the free throughfall coefficient (c) vary among different vegetation types, and what are the potential consequences of these variations?", "answer": "The values of S and c vary significantly among different vegetation types, with dense pine forest having higher values than sparse pine forest or"}]}

Once the canopy is saturated, the duration of the storm may be a better predictor than the amount of precipitation. This is because the relationship between interception and precipitation is not linear after the canopy is saturated."}, {"question": "Why do some researchers propose expressing interception in terms of shower duration rather than amount of precipitation?", "answer": "Some researchers, like Horton, propose expressing interception in terms of shower duration because it may be more logical.

This equation suggests that the average duration of precipitation events and the average rate of evaporation from a wet surface during these events can be used to estimate interception."}, {"question": "How do the values of the average rate of evaporation from a wet surface and the average duration of precipitation events affect the estimation of interception?", "answer": "The values of the average rate of evaporation from a wet surface and the average duration of precipitation events can significantly affect the estimation of interception. Research has shown that the average rate of evaporation is relatively invariant over a wide range of climatic conditions, and good results can be obtained with values mostly around 0.2 mm h−1. The average duration of precipitation events also plays a crucial role in estimating interception, as it can influence the amount of water available for interception."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the leaf area index and the maximum storage of water per unit area of foliage, and how can it be used to estimate interception?", "answer": "The leaf area index is related to the maximum storage of water per unit area of foliage, and this relationship can be used to estimate interception. Equation (3.22) provides a way to estimate the maximum storage of water per unit area of foliage from the leaf area index, and Equation (3.23) shows how this can be used to estimate interception in terms of the leaf area index."}, {"question": "In the context of different plant species, how do the values of the effective film thickness vary, and what implications does this have for estimating interception?", "answer": "The values of the effective film thickness vary among different plant species, ranging from 0.0762 mm for Monterey pine to 0.203 mm for big bluegrass. This variation has implications for estimating interception, as the effective film thickness can influence the amount of water available for interception. For example, plants with thicker effective film thickness may be able to intercept more water, while those with thinner effective film thickness may intercept less."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to estimate interception accurately, and what factors contribute to these challenges?", "answer": "Estimating interception accurately can be challenging due to the complex relationships between precipitation, storm duration, and vegetation characteristics. Factors such as the non-linear relationship between interception and precipitation, the variability in effective film thickness among plant species, and the influence of evaporation rates on interception all contribute to these challenges. Additionally, the saturation of the canopy can also affect the estimation of interception, making it essential to consider these factors when developing empirical equations."}, {"question": "How do researchers account for the variability in vegetation characteristics when estimating interception, and what assumptions are made in this process?", "answer": "Researchers account for the variability in vegetation characteristics by using parameters such as the leaf area index and the effective film thickness. Assumptions are made about the average values of these parameters, such as the leaf area index being between 0.6 and 1.0, and the effective film thickness being around 0.2 mm. These assumptions can be used to estimate interception, but they may not always accurately capture the complexity of real-world vegetation characteristics."}, {"question": "In the context of empirical equations for interception, what are the implications of using a linear regression equation in terms of cumulative precipitation, and how does this relate to the duration of the storm?", "answer": "Using a linear regression equation in terms of cumulative precipitation can be useful for estimating interception, especially for the early stages of a storm. However, this approach may not be suitable for later stages of the storm, after the canopy is saturated. The duration of the storm can be a better predictor of interception in these cases, and using a linear regression equation in terms of cumulative precipitation may not capture this relationship accurately."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.5 RELIABILITY OF OPERATIONAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENTS Precipitation was probably the first hydrologic variable to be measured regularly on a routine basis, and in many places in the world such measurements started more than a century ago. Thus for a variety of purposes in hydrology, the availability of this historic data base presents a useful opportunity. In principle the measurement of precipitation shouldbeasimplematter.Itisimportanttobeaware,however,thatmostoftheavailable records of precipitation from the past suffer from substantial systematic error and that caution is required in their use. This has, of course, been known for a long time (see, for al., 1992; Duchon and Essenberg, 2001), but it is only in relatively recent years that steps have been taken to remedy the situation. Although much remains to be done to solve the archival precipitation data correction problem (Groisman and Legates, 1994), a better understanding is gradually emerging. Standardprecipitationgagesareusuallyplacedwiththeirorificeatsomeheightabove the ground (from 0.5 m on up, depending on the type), primarily for convenience and to avoid raindrop splash and snow drift. Thus one of the main factors is the distortion of the windfieldbythepresenceoftheprecipitationgageasanobstacle,whichresultsinawind reliability of operational precipitation measurements Measurement -- normalized magnitude of velocity vector Gage Type: Mk2 v 3 m Gauge Type: Mk2 v 3 m −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 normalized distance x Fig.3.20 Normalizedvelocitycontourlines,derivedfromwind-tunnelmeasurementsinandaroundastandard BritishMk2precipitationgage,initsverticalplaneofsymmetryparalleltotheflow.Thereferenceair velocityinthetunnelwas3ms−1 fromlefttoright;thedimensionsarenormalizedwiththeouter diameterofthegage,whichis136.6mm.Thewindvelocitiesabovethegageorificecanbeseentobe about35%higherthanthefree-streamvelocity.(FromNesporandSevruk,1999.) speed increase above its orifice and the development of wake eddies around it. This, in turn, tends to carry the finer precipitation particles over the orifice, thus decreasing their numberenteringthegage.Thiseffectincreaseswithheightoftheorifice.Therefore,itcan beexpectedthatthediscrepancybetweenactualandmeasuredprecipitationwillincrease with increasing wind speed, with decreasing precipitation intensity and with increasing height of the gage orifice above ground level. Figure 3.20 illustrates the distortion of the wind field above a rain gage, as derived from wind-tunnel measurements by Nespor this case the velocity of the air above the gage is about 20% to 30% higher than in the approaching undisturbed wind field.

Different measurement techniques have been tried to solve this problem (see Rodda, 1967; Robinson and Rodda, 1969; Sevruk, 1974). The best is probably to use pit gages reliability of operational precipitation measurements Fig.3.23 Cut-awaysketchofthetworeferencestandardprecipitationgagesrecommendedbytheWorld MeteorologicalOrganization(WMO)forcalibrationpurposes.Thepitgage,whichissurroundedby ananti-splashgrid,isforrain;theshieldedgage(3),whichissurroundedbytwofencesof4and12m (Duchon and Essenberg, 2001) with their orifice at ground level. Wind shields are also being used, but most of the designs can only alleviate the problem and never eliminate it; while they are useful in reducing the catch deficiency for snow, they appear to have much less of an effect for rain. For the purpose of calibration of pre- cipitation gages of different types of design, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has recommended the use of two reference standard gages, which have been found to have negligible wind error (Sevruk, 1993b) and which are shown schemat- ically in Figure 3.23. The reference gage for rain consists of a Mk2 gage (British Meteorological Office), installed in a pit with the orifice flush at ground level and surrounded by a grid to avoid splash. The reference gage for snow is a Tretyakov gage (Russian Meteorological Services) with a shield and surrounded by two octag- onal lath-fences, respectively 3 m high and 4 m diameter, and 3.5 m high and 12 m diameter. Additional losses may be caused by initial wetting of the gage (i.e. interception), evaporation, and by the mechanisms of recording gages. Methods have been devel- oped to correct for these systematic errors of undercatch (see, for example, Legates and Nespor and Sevruk, 1999). These studies have led to the consensus that beside mean wind speed, also the rainfall rate and the drop size distribution should be considered in applying corrections to the measured data. Some of these effects are illustrated in Figures 3.22 and 3.24. A study by Habib al. (1999) showed that the averaging time should be considered in the error estimation; an hourly time scale or smaller was recommended. precipitation Integral wind-induced error – Mk2 gage = = -1.0 1.0 v = 5 m s 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall Integral wind-induced error – Hellmann gage = = -1.0 1.0 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall (mm inmmh−1.The ASta(AutomaticStation)precipitationgages,asafunctionoftherateofrainfall errorwascalculatedforthreewindspeeds,asindicated,andfortwotypesofraindropsize −1),andthunderstorm(κ distributions,namelyorographic(κ = = 1).(FromNesporandSevruk, references Integral wind-induced error – ASTA gage = = -1.0 1.0 v = 5 m s 0 10 20 30 40 50 Rate of rainfall (mm Fig.3.24 REFERENCES Alila, Y.

primary factor affecting the accuracy of standard precipitation gauges?", "answer": "The primary factor is the distortion of the wind field by the presence of the precipitation gauge as an obstacle, resulting in a wind speed increase above its orifice and the development of wake eddies around it."}, {"question": "Why do wind shields only alleviate the problem of wind-induced error in precipitation measurements and not eliminate it?", "answer": "Wind shields can only alleviate the problem because they cannot completely prevent the distortion of the wind field around the gauge, and their effectiveness varies depending on the type of precipitation (rain or snow) and other factors such as wind speed and precipitation intensity."}, {"question": "How do the height of the orifice above the ground and the wind speed affect the discrepancy between actual and measured precipitation?", "answer": "The discrepancy between actual and measured precipitation increases with the height

the accuracy of precipitation gauges."}, {"question": "What are the implications of wind-induced error in precipitation measurements for hydrological modeling and water resource management?", "answer": "The implications of wind-induced error in precipitation measurements are significant, as inaccurate precipitation data can lead to errors in hydrological modeling, affecting the prediction of streamflow, water balance, and other hydrological processes, which can have substantial consequences for water resource management, including flood control, water supply, and ecosystem management."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation measurement, what are the challenges associated with measuring precipitation in mountainous terrain?", "answer": "The challenges associated with measuring precipitation in mountainous terrain include the difficulty of installing and maintaining precipitation gauges in remote and inaccessible areas, the impact of wind-induced error, and the need to account for the effects of topography on precipitation patterns, which can lead to significant errors in precipitation measurements and affect the accuracy of hydrological models."}, {"question": "How do the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations for precipitation measurement address the issue of wind-induced error and other sources of error in precipitation measurements?", "answer": "The WMO recommendations for precipitation measurement address the issue of wind-induced error and other sources of error by providing guidelines for the installation and maintenance of precipitation gauges, recommending the use of reference standard precipitation gauges, and promoting the development of methods to correct for systematic errors in precipitation measurements, which can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of precipitation data."}]}

The distances are crucial in determining the influence of each rain gage on the estimation of the missing precipitation data. By considering these distances, the method can account for the spatial variability of precipitation and provide a more reliable estimate."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological data analysis, what are the implications of using the inverse distance method for estimating missing precipitation data?", "answer": "The implications of using the inverse distance method for estimating missing precipitation data are significant, as it allows for the estimation of missing data at one of the rain gages using the measured precipitation at the other rain gages. This method can be particularly useful in areas with limited rain gage coverage, where missing data can significantly impact the accuracy of hydrological models. However, the method assumes that the precipitation pattern is consistent across the area, which may not always be the case. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the results and consider the limitations of the method when using it for hydrological data analysis."}, {"question": "How does the number of rain gages in the area under consideration affect the estimation of missing precipitation data using the inverse distance method?", "answer": "The number of rain gages in the area under consideration can significantly affect the estimation of missing precipitation data using the inverse distance method. With more rain gages, the method can provide a more accurate estimation of the missing data, as it can account for a larger number of nearby rain gages and their respective distances.

These values, which represent specific parameters of the rainfall intensity–duration–frequency relationship, are used to calculate the rainfall intensity for a given duration and frequency. The exact influence of these values on the estimation depends on their roles within the equation, which typically involves exponential or power-law relationships between rainfall intensity, duration, and frequency. For instance, the value of = 30 might represent a scaling factor, while = 0.2 and = 0.05 could represent exponents that determine how quickly rainfall intensity decreases with increasing duration or how frequently extreme events occur."}, {"question": "What is the significance of using Equation (3.3) for describing rainfall intensity–duration–frequency data?", "answer": "Equation (3.3) is significant because it provides a mathematical framework for relating rainfall intensity to its duration and frequency, allowing for the estimation of extreme rainfall events based on historical data. This equation is crucial for hydrological studies as it enables the prediction of rainfall intensities for different durations and return periods, which is essential for designing infrastructure, assessing flood risks, and planning water resources management strategies."}, {"question": "How do the units of measurement for h (mm/h) and c (years) reflect the nature of the rainfall intensity–duration–frequency relationship?", "answer": "The units of measurement for h (mm/h) and c (years) reflect the nature of the rainfall intensity–duration–frequency relationship by indicating that h represents an hourly rate of rainfall (intensity) and c represents a time scale (in years) over which the frequency of rainfall events is considered. This distinction in units highlights the complex interplay between the intensity and frequency of rainfall events, which is fundamental to understanding and predicting hydrological phenomena."}, {"question": "In the context of water resources engineering, why is understanding the 50-year rainfall event crucial?", "answer": "Understanding the 50-year rainfall event is crucial in water resources engineering because it provides a basis for designing infrastructure that can withstand extreme rainfall events, thereby protecting communities from flooding and ensuring the reliability of water supply systems. The 50-year event is a common design criterion, meaning that infrastructure is designed to handle rainfall events that are expected to occur once every 50 years, on average.

These challenges impact water resource management by introducing uncertainties in water balance calculations, which can lead to inefficiencies in water allocation, conservation, and flood control measures. Accurate evaporation rate estimation is essential for managing water resources sustainably, as it directly affects the availability of water for various uses, including irrigation, drinking water supply, and ecosystem maintenance. Therefore, addressing these challenges through advanced measurement techniques, modeling, and data analysis is critical for improving water resource management practices."}, {"question": "In the context of global water balance, how does the proportion of precipitation that evaporates over land surfaces influence the amount of water available for runoff and infiltration?", "answer": "The proportion of precipitation that evaporates over land surfaces significantly influences the amount of water available for runoff and infiltration, as it determines how much of the precipitation is lost to the atmosphere rather than contributing to surface and groundwater recharge. A higher evaporation rate means less water is available for runoff and infiltration, which can impact the replenishment of water bodies, the recharge of groundwater aquifers, and the maintenance of healthy ecosystems. Understanding this relationship is vital for managing water resources effectively, as it helps in predicting water availability and planning for water use and conservation strategies."}]}
{"paragraph": "4.1 EVAPORATION MECHANISMS As a physical phenomenon, evaporation is the transition of water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase. This transition requires first, an energy supply to provide water molecules the necessary kinetic energy to escape from the liquid surface; and second, some mechanism to remove the escaped molecules from the immediate vicinity of the liquid surface thus preventing that they would return to condense (see Figure 4.1). These two requirements have traditionally given rise to two classes of methods to describe evaporation, namely (i) masstransferoraerodynamicformulations,whichconsistprimarilyofthedescrip- tion of the water vapor transport mechanisms in the near-surface air of the atmo- sphere, and (ii) energy budget formulations, in which the main focus is on the energy supply aspects of the phenomenon. Actually, this classification scheme is somewhat unsatisfactory, because it is almost never possible to consider mass transfer and energy aspects of evaporation in isolation from each other; as will become clear below, energy budget methods usually cannot avoid mass transfer considerationsin their application, and vice versa. Nevertheless, this classification will be used in what follows, mainly for historic reasons. In addition, a third class of methods is considered, namely (iii) water budget formulations, in which evaporation is treated as the unknown rest term in the continuity equation (1.7) or (1.8) for various types of control volumes that include the landsurface–atmosphere interface as a boundary. Among these three, the formulations in class (i) are based on the most direct descrip- tion of the water vapor transport mechanisms, so that whenever possible they should evaporation Vapor removal by turbulent air Condensation Vaporization by kinetic energy Liquid water Fig.4.1 Liquidwatermoleculeswithsufficientkineticenergyescapefromtheliquidsurfacebyvaporization.

The traditional classification scheme is somewhat unsatisfactory because energy budget methods usually involve mass transfer considerations, and vice versa. This interdependence means that the two aspects are intertwined, making it challenging to separate them completely. As a result, the classification scheme, although used for historic reasons, does not fully capture the complexity of the evaporation process."}, {"question": "In the classification of evaporation methods, what are the three classes, and how do they differ from one another?", "answer": "The three classes of evaporation methods are (i) mass transfer or aerodynamic formulations, (ii) energy budget formulations, and (iii) water budget formulations. These classes differ in their focus: mass transfer formulations describe water vapor transport mechanisms, energy budget formulations focus on the energy supply aspects, and water budget formulations treat evaporation as an unknown term in the continuity equation for control volumes including the land surface-atmosphere interface."}, {"question": "Why do mass transfer formulations have priority over other methods, and what is the limitation of energy budget formulations?", "answer": "Mass transfer formulations have priority because they provide the most direct description of the water vapor transport mechanisms. Energy budget formulations, while useful, are indirect as they utilize quantities physically different from water vapor transport. However, energy budget methods still allow for independent estimates of the water vapor flux, which is not the case for water budget formulations that require knowledge of all other components in the water budget."}, {"question": "In the context of water budget formulations, what is the primary challenge when using this method for estimating evaporation?", "answer": "The primary challenge with water budget formulations is that they require a knowledge of all the other components in the water budget. This makes them unsuitable for situations where the objective is to close the hydrologic cycle and obtain independent estimates of all its components. Essentially, water budget formulations are dependent on having comprehensive data on other hydrologic components, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios."}, {"question": "How does the removal mechanism of escaped water molecules influence the process of evaporation, and why is it necessary?", "answer": "The removal mechanism is crucial for preventing the establishment of an equilibrium state where vaporization would be balanced by condensation. Without this mechanism, the escaped molecules would return to the liquid surface, condense, and thus prevent continuous evaporation. The removal mechanism, typically facilitated by turbulent air, ensures that the escaped molecules are carried away, allowing the evaporation process to continue."}, {"question": "In comparing mass transfer and energy budget formulations, what are the implications of their differences for estimating evaporation rates?", "answer": "The differences between mass transfer and energy budget formulations have significant implications for estimating evaporation rates. Mass transfer formulations, being more direct, can provide more accurate estimates of water vapor flux. Energy budget formulations, while indirect, can still offer independent estimates but may involve more assumptions and uncertainties related to the energy supply aspects. The choice between these formulations can affect the accuracy and reliability of evaporation rate estimates, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the underlying mechanisms and data requirements."}, {"question": "Why are energy budget methods still useful despite being indirect, and what advantage do they offer over water budget formulations?", "answer": "Energy budget methods are useful because they allow for independent estimates of the water vapor flux, even though they are indirect and utilize quantities different from water vapor transport. This is a significant advantage over water budget formulations, which require comprehensive knowledge of all other components in the water budget and thus cannot provide independent estimates of evaporation. The ability of energy budget methods to offer independent estimates makes them valuable in hydrologic studies, especially when direct measurements of water vapor transport are challenging or unavailable."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic cycle closure, why are water budget formulations less preferred, and what are the challenges they pose?", "answer": "Water budget formulations are less preferred for hydrologic cycle closure because they require knowledge of all other components in the water budget, making them dependent on comprehensive data that may not always be available. This dependency poses a significant challenge, as it limits the ability to independently estimate evaporation and other hydrologic components. Furthermore, the requirement for detailed knowledge of all budget components can introduce uncertainties and complexities, making water budget formulations less suitable for achieving accurate hydrologic cycle closure."}]}

{"paragraph": "4.2.2 Methods in terms of mean variables Over a uniform surface with adequate fetch, formulations in terms of mean variables are based directly on the similarity principles for the atmospheric boundary layer discussed in Chapter 2. The word “mean” as used here, refers to the fact that the and data are obtained by averaging over a certain time period, in the same way as was explained for the second moments in the previous section. These methods can be classified into two general types, namely bulk transfer methods and mean profile methods. Bulk-transfer approach In this approach the flux is determined by means of equations, whose general form is temperature, respectively. One of the more common forms of (2.33) used in practical applications is as follows E Ce u (q q ) (4.3) where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to measurement levels z and z above the ground, the subscript s refers to the ground surface at z 0 and Ce can be determined theoreti- cally or empirically. The specific humidity at the surface q must be known in Equation saturation value at the temperature of the water surface. The main practical advantage of this mass-transfer approach, usually with a constant-known coefficient Ce, lies in the fact that it can be applied on a routine basis with regular and easily obtainable data of mean wind speed, water surface temperature and humidity of the air. As discussed already in Section 2.5.2, Equation (4.3) can be justified readily by the these functions also show that any empirical mass transfer coefficient Ce for data taken in the atmospheric boundary layer, can only be constant if the roughness parameters are evaporation constant, and either if the atmosphere is neutral, or if the effect of stability as reflected in is negligible or constant. Example 4.1. Mass-transfer coefficient in neutral atmosphere Under neutral conditions by virtue of (2.41) and (2.44), the water vapor transfer coeffi- cient, as it appears in Equation (4.3), is simply Ce (4.4) 2 0 0v 1 0 0 inwhich z and z aretheheightsofthemeasurementofthewindspeedandofthespecific humidity, respectively, and in which can be taken to be zero over a water surface. Within a certain range of normal wind speeds, neutral conditions are apparently often satisfied over ocean and sea surfaces. Indeed, numerous experimental determinations have shown that on average the ocean transfer coefficients are of the order of Ce ( −3,inwhichthesubscriptindicatesthatthemeasurementsare 1.2 (±0.30) × takenat z z 10mabovethesurface.Generally,thecorrespondingdragcoefficient 1.4 (±0.3) × is a little larger, and of the order of Cd 10 on average; it also tends to be more sensitive to the sea state. The scatter among many of the experimental estimates of the transfer coeffi- cients Ce and Cd over water is considerable. This means that when accurate 10 10 10 results are required the use of some average coefficient may not be adequate and it may be necessary to include the effects of atmospheric stability and of the roughness lengths, and therefore in the case of water surfaces, also of sea state. Numerous expres- sions have been proposed relating Cd to wind speed or surface shear stress for large water surfaces (see Brutsaert, 1982). Over water surfaces of limited size, such as small lakes, Ce can be expected to depend on fetch, that is the distance from the upwind shore. However, in the case of medium size lakes, with fetches of the order of 1–10 km, Ce is quite insensitive to fetch, provided the specific humidity of the air and the wind speed are determined over the center of the lake surface. Thus Equation (4.3) with Ce 1.2 10 can also be used for such conditions as a first approximation. For more accurate results, however, it may be advisable to calibrate Ce in (4.3) for each individual lake. The form of (4.3) is, in a sense, also suggestive of many other types of mass transfer equations,mostlyempirical,whichhavebeenproposedinthepast.Onesuchevaporation equation, originally proposed by Stelling in 1822 (see Brutsaert, 1982) and still in use today, can be written as where e ¯ is the mean vapor pressure and the subscripts refer to the heights of the mea- surements. From the definition of the specific humidity q with the equation of state for water vapor (2.5) and for bulk air (2.6), it follows that to a good approximation q 0.622 (4.6) mass transfer formulations This shows that the vapor pressure e is closely proportional to the specific humidity q. Theintroductionoftheadditionalconstantain(4.5)maybeviewedasameansofimprov- ing the curve-fit between the mean wind speed and the rate of evaporation. Although their theoretical justification is marginal, equations like Stelling’s (4.5) have been found useful to describe evaporation from water or wet surfaces. Some examples for various problemsandsurfacescanbefoundinpapersbyPenman(1948,1956),BrutsaertandYu equations, in terms of the vapor pressure difference, are sometimes written in a more general form as follows where,asbefore,thesubscriptsrefertothelevelsabovethesurface z and z atwhichthe measurements are made, and (u) is called the wind function, which can be obtained Mean profile methods The available flux-profile functions for the boundary layer given in Section 2.5.2 allow the calculation of the surface fluxes from measurements of mean concentration at two or more levels. The specific form of the profile functions depends on the level above the surface, i.e. the specific sublayer, where the measurements are made (see Figure 2.6). Profile methods are most useful in the atmospheric surface layer, where they can be based on the Monin–Obukhov similarity. Recall that the surface sublayer is the fully turbulent layer, located between a height , which is well above the surface roughness elements – say at least four to five times their height h – and a height z , which is roughly of the order of one tenth of the thickness of the boundary layer; a more precise estimateoftheextentofthesurfacelayerispresentedinSection2.5.2.Theprofilesinthis these equations refer to a lower and upper level at which the respective measurements of and aremade;clearly,theseelevationsneednotbethesameinallthreeequations. Inthisapproach,thefluxofanyadmixture,beitE,u∗ orH,cannotbecalculatedsimply from measurements of its corresponding concentration, u or only; indeed, except fluxes. In practice there are two alternative methods of closing a flux determination problem. The first method consists of the simultaneous solution of Equations (2.50)–(2.52) surements at least at two levels of mean specific humidity, mean wind speed and mean temperature. This numerical problem may be solved in different ways. One simple way is by iteration, as follows; it is assumed initially that the profiles are logarithmic, i.e. that L=∞sothatthe (cid:6)-functionsarezero.Thispermitsthecalculationofafirstestimateof evaporation of the Obukhov length L in (2.46). This first estimate of L allows next the calculation in turn allow the calculation of a second estimate of L, and so on. The iteration can be stopped when successive estimates cease to change appreciably. When measurements of and are available at more than two elevations, at each iteration u∗, E and regression through the origin. Example 4.2. Evaporation by profile method in a neutral atmosphere Inaneutrallystratifiedatmosphere,theturbulentheatfluxisrelativelysmall;thereforethe ζ (cid:6)-functions file equations (2.40) and (2.43). Combination of these two equations allows the direct calculation of the evaporation rate by means of the following expression k2ρ(u − − u )(q q ) in terms of measurements of the wind speed at levels z and z , and measurements of specific humidity at levels and above the ground. An equation similar to this result wasfirstpresentedbyThornthwaiteandHolzman(1939).Whilethisderivationprovides agooddidacticillustrationoftheprofilemethod,itshouldbenotedthatEquation(4.8)is oflimitedpracticalapplicability,becauseoverlandtheatmosphereisonlyrarelyneutral. Thus, in most cases the profile method requires solution of the full set of equations The second method consists of using the known mean profile and the surface flux of another but similar scalar, in addition to the mean profile of the scalar under consider- ation. The requirement of similarity refers in this context to the equality of the transfer (cid:6) (cid:6) scalars; in this sense, it also refers to the equality of the functions and in the of this principle is the Bowen ratio (Bowen, 1926) Bo E (4.9) in which L is the latent heat of vaporization of water. Hence, if similarity is valid, this ratio, which is used mostly in the energy budget method (see Section 4.3) can also be written in terms of profile measurements as follows Bo (4.10) L (q q ) Over water the surface values and q are commonly used instead of values in the air and q , respectively. The Bowen ratio concept thus leads to a simple expression energy budget and related formulations forevaporationintermsofthesensibleheatfluxandofmeanspecifichumidityandmean temperature measurements in the surface layer, as follows As an aside, in a similar way the surface flux of any other passive admixture of the air (e.g. CO ) can be estimated by means of (4.11), by replacing the measurements of q in this expression by measurements of the mean concentration c of the admixture under consideration. Alternatively, the surface flux F of any admixture can also be expressed in terms of, say, measurements of mean specific humidity and concentration c, and a known rate of evaporation, as follows F (4.12) So far in this section, the mean profile method has been explained for application with profile data in the surface layer. In principle, the method can also be applied with upper air data measured in the outer region of the boundary layer by means of bulk ABL similarity the same reason, the simultaneous solution of these bulk similarity equations may require an iteration method, like the one described above for the surface layer (Mawdsley and Brutsaert,1977).Amorerecentformulationofthefunctionssuitableforthispurposeunder unstable conditions is given in Equations (2.69) and (2.70).

{"paragraph": "4.3.1 Standard application When the main objective is the determination of evaporation E (or the sensible heat flux into the air H), it is convenient to rewrite the energy budget equation (2.72) as where is defined as the available energy flux density Q R G L F A n n p p h whose terms are discussed in Section 2.6. As mentioned, in many applications the last three terms in (4.14) are of little consequence, so that it is often sufficiently accurate to In hydrology it is common practice to express the specific energy fluxes as equivalent rates of evaporation; Equation (4.13) can then be written as E H Q (4.15) = H/L = /L where H and Q Q . Observe, however, that with a typical value of e e ne n e = 2.466 × L J kg (at 15 Cin Table2.4),1Wm isroughlyequivalentwithan evaporation of 1.07 kg m per month. Thus as a rule of thumb, to have a rough idea of evaporation the magnitudes of the fluxes involved, energy flux units of W m can be interchanged with hydrologic units of millimeters per month (mm mo of liquid water evaporation. When Q and either H or E can be determined independently, Equation (4.13) provides directly the remaining unknown flux. Usually, however, both and are unknown, and an indirect method must be used. From the methodological point of view, these indirect energy budget methods are analogous to the mean profile meth- ods of Section 4.2.2. In both, essentially three equations are used which contain three unknowns E, u∗ and H implicitly. In the profile methods these are the equa- tions for u and In the energy budget methods, (4.13) is used either with equations for q and or with equations for u and or q, as will be shown next. With Bowen ratio (EBBR) When is known, the combination of the energy budget equation (4.13) with the Bowen ratio defined in Equation (4.9) produces E (4.16) Similarly, for the sensible heat flux one has Bo can be determined as shown in (4.10), from profile data of temperature and specific humidity in the atmospheric surface layer. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, these data should be taken as averages over 15–30 min, approximately. Equation (4.16) shows that the energy budget with Bowen ratio (EBBR) method is most accurate when Bo is small. Both (4.16) and (4.17) produce a singularity when Bo but, as pointed out by Tanner (1960), over an active vegetation this is not a problem, as this situation usually occurs when is low, around sunrise, sunset and occasionally at night. The situation does occur more often over cold water, and it may be necessary to use an alternative −1 < < −0.5 method when Bo to avoid the problem of a very small denominator in for these special conditions. Another way consists of using mean values of Bo corrected by means of wind measurements, as outlined by Webb (1964); this method is especially useful when some terms in the available energy Q are only known for daily periods or The EBBR method has the advantage that no similarity functions for the atmospheric turbulence appear explicitly in the formulation. With Equation (4.10) no measurements of turbulence or of the mean wind speed are required, and the formulation, as written small, the EBBR method may be less susceptible, albeit not immune, to imperfect fetch conditions, than mean profile methods, in which such effects are more directly apparent. The validity of the EBBR method depends critically on the similarity of the temperature and humidity profile; for the surface layer this requires the equality of the terms in the energy budget and related formulations (cid:6) = (cid:6) supports the view that , even under stable conditions (see Dias and Brutsaert, With profiles of wind and of a scalar (EBWSP) If the profile data, either of the mean temperature or of the mean specific humidity, are lackingtoapplytheEBBR,theenergybudgetmethodcanbeappliedinsteadwiththemean windspeedprofile.Infact,thisprocedureispotentiallymorepowerfulthantheBowenratio method, because it yields not only E and H but also u∗.

This allows an approximation, first introduced by Penman (1948) and given in Equation (4.20) below; the main advantage of this approximation is that it eliminates the need for measurements of and at two levels, as in the profile methods (Section 4.2.2) and standard energy budget methods (Section 4.3.1) and that measurements at one level suffice.

Note that in Penman’s (1948) original derivation it was assumed that Q R and that all the other terms in Equation (4.14) are negligible. As mentioned, from the practical point of view, the main feature of this result is that it requires measurements of mean specific humidity, wind speed and temperature at one level only. This is a direct consequence of the approximation introduced in (4.20). For this reason, Penman’s equation is useful when measurements at more than one level, needed for profile methods or standard energy budget methods, are unavailable or impractical. Equation (4.23) has been widely used, but there is still no generally accepted way to formulate (u ), the wind function in . Its definition in (4.24) suggests that any suitablemasstransfercoefficientcanbeusedforthispurpose(seeSection4.2.2).Penman (1948) originally proposed an equation of the Stelling-type (4.5) as follows where u is the mean wind speed at 2 m above the surface in m s and the constants require that E in Equation (4.24) is in mm d and the vapor pressure is in hPa. There are indications that Equation (4.25) yields reasonable results for natural terrain with small to moderate roughness (see Thom and Oliver, 1977); on the basis of experimental observations, it has also been suggested (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1975) that for irrigated crops, the constant 0.54 should be replaced by 0.86. In calculations of long-term mean evaporation values of E with equations like (4.25), to a first approximation the wind speed at 2 m can be estimated by assuming a power dependency on height, or u u (4.26) where z is the height (in m) at which the available wind data are measured. A more fundamental approach to determine the wind function is based on turbulence similarity. Thus in terms of the bulk water vapor transfer coefficient as defined, for example, in (4.3), in which is the height of the measurement of and that of , one obtains by virtue of (4.6), the wind function f (u ) 0.622 u (4.27) Ce can be determined by means of the similarity profile functions of Chapter 2.

WhenPenman’sequationisappliedtocalculatemeanvaluesof E overperiodsofaday when hourly values are required, the effect of atmospheric stability, which varies through the day, may be important. It is possible to include the effect of the atmospheric stability in the wind function, by writing the drying power of the air (4.24) in a form similar to (2.56) (see also Brutsaert, 1982) as follows a 0 a 0 0v E ku∗ ) ln (4.29) where q and arethespecifichumidityoftheairandthesaturationspecifichumidityatair temperature, respectively.

Evaporation from wet surfaces in the absence of advection The two-term structure of Equation (4.23) suggests an interpretation which may serve as an aid in understanding the effect of regional or large-scale advection. When the air has been in contact with a wet surface over a very long fetch, it could be argued that it may tend to become vapor saturated, so that E , shown in (4.24), should tend to zero. energy budget and related formulations Accordingly, Slatyer and McIlroy (1961) reasoned that the first term on the right of Equation (4.23) may be considered a lower limit for evaporation from moist surfaces. E Q (4.30) (cid:9) + γ was referred to as equilibrium evaporation, and the second term of (4.23) may be inter- preted a departure from that equilibrium. In the absence of cloud condensation or radia- tivedivergence,thisdeparturewouldstemfromlarge-scaleorregionaladvectioneffects, involving horizontal variation of surface or atmospheric conditions. Subsequent investigations have shown, however, that over wet surfaces, true equilib- rium conditions are encountered only rarely, if ever. The main reason for this is that the atmospheric boundary layer is never a perfectly homogeneous boundary layer, as would be the case in channel flow; rather, it is continually responding to unsteady large-scale weather patterns, involving condensation aloft and dry air entrainment, which tend to maintainahumiditydeficitevenovertheocean.Nevertheless,theideaunderlyingEqua- tion(4.30)hasledPriestleyandTaylor(1972)touseequilibriumevaporationasthebasis foranempiricalrelationshiptodescribeevaporationfromawetsurfaceunderconditions of minimal advection, E .

Still, it is remarkable that so many landsurfaces covered withfairlyshortvegetation,suchasgrass,whichisnotactuallywetbutwithamplewater available to the roots, yield about the same average values, ranging between 1.20 and 1.30, as open water surfaces. This may be the result of a fortuitous compensation of the specific humidity of non-wet leaf surfaces, which is lower than saturation, by a larger effective roughness, and thus transfer coefficient, of the vegetative surface. Still, in some studies drastically different values of have been reported. This has been especially the case for very rough surfaces; for instance McNaughton and Black (1973) obtained 1.05 for a young, 8 m high fir forest. evaporation Fig.4.3 VariationofBowen ratio formoist surfacesasgivenby Equation(4.32); thesolidcurve representsanα valueof1.26andthe twodashedcurves representvaluesof 1.20and1.30.The datapoints(fordaily values)were collectedbyDavies andAllen(1973) fromdifferent 10 15 20 25 30 sources.

Such equations, which provide a good alternative to (4.31) when only short-wave radiation and temperature are available, have beenusedtodetermineirrigationrequirementsandasclimatologicalindicesofpotential evaporation. However, the physical significance of such indices is not always clear, as is shown next. Potential evaporation Becauseseveralofthesimpleenergybudget-typemethodsforwetsurfacesareoftenused asmeasuresofpotentialevapotranspiration,afewcommentsareinorderonthisconcept. The term potential evapotranspiration appears to have been introduced by Thornthwaite (1948) in the context of the classification of climate. It is now generally understood to refer to the maximal rate of evaporation from a large area covered completely and uniformly by an actively growing vegetation with adequate moisture at all times. The area is specified as large to avoid the possible effects of advection. Although the concept is widely used, it has also caused confusion, because it does not encompass all possible conditions and it involves several ambiguities. The concept requires closer specification if it is to serve as an unequivocal parameter. Transpiration, even at the potential rate, involves such biological effects as stomatal impedance to the diffusion of water vapor, and the stage in the growth cycle of the vegetation. For this reason, the term potential evaporation is probably preferable. It can be defined to refer to the evaporation from any large uniform surface that is sufficiently moist or wet, so that the air in contact with it is fully saturated. Note that a wet or moist surface is not the same as one that has an adequate moisture supply for the roots of an actively growing vegetation; over short non-wet vegetation with adequate moisture the energy budget and related formulations evapotranspiration is often fairly similar to the evaporation from open water under the same conditions. As mentioned above, a possible explanation for this is that the stomatal impedancetowatervapordiffusionmaybecompensatedbythelargerroughnessvalues, resulting in larger transfer coefficients, of the vegetational surface. Another point of ambiguity is that potential evaporation is often estimated by means of meteorological data observed under nonpotential conditions. Because the air interacts with the underlying surface, this is not the same rate as that which would be calculated or observed, if the surface had been moist or adequately supplied with water. There- fore, potential evaporation estimated on the basis of measurements carried out under nonpotential conditions should be called “apparent” to reflect this fact. Examples of apparentpotentialevaporationaretheestimatesmadebymeansofanevaporationpanor by means of the Penman equation (4.23), on the basis of measurements in the actual, i.e. non-potential or arid, environment. Another example of apparent potential evaporation would be that obtained by means of Equation (4.3), in which at the dry surface is assumed to be given by q (T ), i.e. the saturation specific humidity at the temperature of that surface.

{"paragraph": "4.3.3 Operational methods for landsurfaces Many operational procedures used in applied hydrology to predict evaporation involve some type of potential evaporation, used in conjunction with a procedure to derive the actual evaporation from it for the prevailing non-potential conditions. Proportional fluxes with surface moisture “bucket” Probably the oldest method, which follows work by Budyko (1955; 1974) and Thornth- waite and Mather (1955), is based on the following proportionality E E (4.33) where E is a potential evaporation rate, and a reduction factor reflecting the mois- ture availability. As mentioned above, potential evaporation is a somewhat ambiguous concept; not surprisingly, therefore, in practice Equation (4.33) has been applied with two different classes of E , such as E , the apparent potential evaporation as defined in the previous section, and , the Priestley–Taylor equation given in (4.31). The reduction factor is often assumed to be a function of soil water content. In the application of (4.33) with such expressions for apparent potential evaporation as (4.3) and (4.23), a common assumption has been β = w > w e c 0 c 0 where is a critical soil water content above which E equals E , and is a lower cut-off value below which E is zero. This is illustrated in Figure 4.4. The value of can be determined on the basis of a soil water budget (see Thornthwaite and Mather, evaporation Fig.4.4 Illustrationofthecommonlyassumed relationshipbetweenthemoisture availabilityfactorβ andthewater contentstatusw ofthelandsurface complex.Inpracticalapplicationsthis canbeusedwithbothapparentand actualpotentialevaporation. must be determined by calibration; for a surface soil layer with an assumed thickness of about 1 m, is generally taken to be of the order of 10–20 cm of water. The reduction factor can also be related to some other surface moisture indices beside such as the accumulated actual evaporation minus precipitation (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), the local near-surface soil moisture content (see Davies and Allen, 1973; Crago and and the antecedent precipitation index (Choudhury and Blanchard, 1983; Mawdsley and Ali, 1985; Owe al., 1989), again through calibration of the model with available data. In some implementations of the same idea, the actual evaporation E is expressed in E )E (4.35) in which E can be determined by means of (4.30). For instance, Figure 4.5 shows the results of Davies and Allen (1973) expressed as the product ) versus volumetric water content of the upper 5 cm of the soil. Although a nonlinear function is fitted to the data, it is similar to Equation (4.34). With data measured over prairie terrain it was found by Chen and Brutsaert (1995) that, with as the volumetric moisture content in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile, the relationship between E and E can be described by the following linear function ) (4.36) 0.05 ≤ θ ≤ 0.27, (β α = 1.26 in the range and ) for higher moisture contents; how- ever, it was also observed that the relationship could be improved markedly by making ) not only dependent on soil moisture content but also on the density of the grassy vegetation cover, as expressed by the leaf area index La and the green vegetation fraction. energy budget and related formulations 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Scaled Soil Moisture, Variationof(β α e)withthewatercontentintheupper5cmofthesoilθ Fig.4.5 5,expressedrelativetoits valueatfieldcapacityθ forasandyloamcoveredwithperennialryegrassinOntario.Thecurve 1.26[1−exp(−10.563θ representsthefunctionβ α = /θ f)].(AfterDaviesandAllen,1973.) One difficulty in applying the formulation (4.33) with an apparent potential evaporation E is that, as the surface dries out, the two quantities on the right-hand side of (4.33) move in opposite directions. Indeed, whenever approaches zero, E tends to become large; this may lead to an unstable product of a large with a small quan- tity, each with considerable noise. On the other hand, E depends mainly on radiation and temperature, and not on the dryness of the air; hence application of (4.33) with E is likely to be more robust and therefore preferable. Surface resistance concept A second procedure of reducing to is based on the realization that the release of water vapor from a vegetation is controlled by the stomata of the leaves. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 4.6. The underlying idea is that the air is assumed to be saturated withwatervaporinsidethestomatalcavitiesbutnotattheoutsidesurfaceoftheleaves,and thestomataprovideanobstructionoraresistancetothediffusionofthewatervaporfromthe insidetotheoutsideoftheleaves.Thisisoftenreferredtoastomatalresistance r .Because evaporationalsotakesplacefromthesoilsurface,besidetheleaves,thebasicideaisusually extended to include this transport as well; thus the soil air at some depth below the surface can be assumed to be saturated and the soil pores can then be visualized as providing a resistance to the diffusion of water vapor to the soil surface. Hence more generally, the resistance approach is based on the concept of one or more resistance parameters in parallel and/or in series, which may account for the moisture stress in the vegetation and/or soil, and which relate saturation specific humidity , at the temperature T of the evaporating surface, to the actual (non-saturated) specific humidity q at the evaporating surface. Several such resistance parameters have been used for this purpose (see, for example, Monteith, 1973). The one given by Thom (1972) is instructive as an illustration and can be evaporation Fig.4.6 Sketchofatypicalcross sectionthroughthe undersideofaleaf.

For practical use there have generally been two types of evaporation equation based on the resistance concept. In the derivation of the first type, q , which is unknown, is eliminated betweenEquation(4.37)andthestandardmasstransferequation(4.3)toyieldtheexpression E ) (4.38) expression in a way analogous to (4.23), namely (cid:9)Q +γCe ρ −q E (4.39) energy budget and related formulations 1973; 1981; Thom, 1975) Numerousexperimentshavebeenconductedtodetermineresistancevaluesfordifferent types of vegetation. This has been mostly done in the context of expressions related to (Tan and Black, 1976). In addition, many attempts have been made to relate resistance parameters with such factors as Bowen ratio, soil moisture suction in the root zone, soil moisture deficit, humidity deficit in the air, solar radiation, temperature, leaf area index Lindroth, 1985; Stewart, 1988; Gash al. 1989). The relationships developed so far are mainly statistical, so that they are vegetation and site dependent. Therefore, the resistance formulation is probably not yet sufficiently general to be practical for predictive purposes, but it has been useful as a diagnostic index in certain simulation studies (for example, to calculate missing data). As a note of caution, in previous studies the resistance formulation has not always been For instance, the drag coefficient Cd (or the related so-called aerodynamic conductance) is often used instead of Ce, as required in the rigorous derivation of Equation (4.23) with above vegetation z , nor that (or ), Cd is rarely equal to Ce. As a result 0 0v m v h of this inappropriate use of Cd (instead of Ce), it is not clear how the turbulence aspects of the transport, normally embodied in Ce, can be partitioned or separated from the strictly vegetational and/or soil moisture aspects of the transport supposedly embodied in r . This has undoubtedly contributed to the difficulty in deriving general relationships for both Ce and r on the basis of (4.39). Although the resistance formulation with r may appear conceptually quite different from Equation (4.33) with the reduction factor , both approaches are, in fact, practically a wet surface) and a reduction factor β = (1+r Ce u (4.40) β = [1+r Ce (4.41) and as (4.33) with (4.31) and a reduction factor u ] Ce u (4.42) e 1 ne s 1 InpracticalapplicationsofEquations(4.38)and(4.39)aknowledgeoftheparametersCe and r is essential. The physical nature of Ce is well understood and based on sound turbu- lencetheory.Buttheconceptualsignificanceoftheresistanceconceptremainsproblematic, in spite of the many studies devoted to it. evaporation Complementary fluxes with advection–aridity ThisconceptwasfirstproposedbyBouchet(1963),whopostulated,almostindiametrical opposition to Equation (4.33), a certain complementary relation between the actual evaporation E, and what we now recognize as the apparent potential evaporation E . The underlying argument may be developed as follows. If for one or other reason, independent of the available energy, the actual evaporation E decreases below its true potential value E , a certain amount of energy not used up in evaporation becomes (cid:9)H, available. This manifests itself as an increase in the sensible heat flux or − = (cid:9)H E E (4.43) Attheregionalscalethisdecreaseof E,relativeto ,affectsprimarilythetemperature, humidity and turbulence of the air near the ground, but it probably has a smaller effect (cid:9)H, on the net radiation. This increased sensible heat flux causes an increase in the apparent potential evaporation E inferred for these drier and warmer conditions. In (cid:9)H, general, to a first approximation this increase can be assumed to be proportional to so that one has = + ε (cid:9)H in which is an effectiveness parameter, which may depend on the adopted defi- nition of . Combination of Equations (4.43) and (4.44) yields then (cid:9)H; increased by exactly in this case, combination of (4.43) and (4.44) yields immedi- ately the simple complementary relationship 2 (4.45) This result can be rearranged to yield the actual evaporation in dimensionless form and similarly the apparent potential evaporation In Equations (4.46) and (4.47) the ratio ) may be considered as a moisture or humidity index, which depends on such factors as soil moisture and vegetation density; both relationships are illustrated in Figure 4.8. It can be seen that the dependence of ), as given by Equation (4.46) and shown in Figure 4.8, has a similar trend as those shown in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Applications of Equation (4.45) have been made over different time scales, namely and Katul, 1992). In the application of Equation (4.45) by Brutsaert and Stricker pa po pe mated by (4.31). Thus it was assumed that the effect of the aridity on the performance of (4.23) under non-potential conditions would mainly show up in the second term, and energy budget and related formulations 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Moisture index, Fig.4.8 Sketchillustratingthecomplementaryrelationshipbetweentheactualevaporation andthe Epa,forvaryingconditionsofmoistureavailability,asexpressedby apparentpotentialevaporation E/Epa.BothEand Epa Epo. theirratio arenormalizedwiththetruepotentialevaporation not at all in the first term on the right-hand side. Substitution of (4.23) and (4.31) into (4.45) yields the practical result (cid:9) γ = (2α − − E 1) Q E (4.48) As before, there are several ways of estimating , the drying power of the air. It can simply be estimated in terms of the vapor pressure deficit by means of Equation (4.24) with Penman’s wind function (4.25). It can also be estimated in terms of the specific humiditydeficitoftheairbymeansofthemasstransfercoefficient CedefinedinEquation (4.3). In this case the actual evaporation is given by (cid:9) γ 1) Ce ) (4.49) The main advantage of (4.48), (4.49) and other equations like them based on the com- plementaryapproach,isthattheydonotrequireanyinformationrelatedtosoilmoisture, canopy resistance, or other measures of aridity, because they rely on meteorological parameters only. The main limitation is that, while the idea underlying (4.45) is simple and plausible, it was not arrived at in a rigorous theoretical or experimental way. Equa- tions like (4.48) and (4.49) have been applied in a number of studies in widely different climates. The approach appears to perform best under conditions with relatively mild advection. However, under strongly advective conditions with large saturation humid- ity deficits, it seems that the validity of the assumptions on which it is based become questionable. Sugita et al. (2001) concluded that (4.45) is only approximately valid in most cases; Hobbins et al. (2001) showed how the basic approach can be improved by calibration of the parameters and E (or Ce) in Equation (4.49). Although the evaporation complementary approach shows specific promise as a practical tool, it still awaits a definitive physical analysis to make it fully effective.

{"paragraph": "4.3.4 Diurnal cycle over land: the self-preservation approximation Itiswellknownthatundercertainfavorableconditions,whenhorizontaladvectionisnottoo strong, the daytime variations of the major energy fluxes at land surfaces are quite similar. This similarity in the diurnal cycle of the different energy flux components over land is illustrated in Figures 2.19 and 2.20, and in Figure 4.9. This means that during any given day the ratios of these fluxes remain approximately constant, which may be considered a manifestationofsomekindof“self-preservation.”Becauseevaporationisusuallyrelatively smallduringthenight,thisself-preservationcansometimesbeusefultorelatedailyaverages with instantaneous or hourly values. This idea was made use of by Jackson et al. (1983) by means of (L R ), in order to estimate the total daily latent heat flux on the basis of a one-time-of-day value. The idea was also used for the same purpose by Shuttleworth et al. evaporativefraction EF L G)orEF L E H).Crago(1996)applied the idea with still another dimensionless evaporation rate, namely , where E is the equilibrium evaporation defined in Equation (4.30). In more general terms (Brutsaert and Sugita, 1992), the assumption of self-preservation requires that the evaporative flux ratio, ER (4.51) be taken as a constant during the daytime hours. In (4.51) is some other flux term (beside L E) in the surface energy budget, which exhibits a similar diurnal cycle as L E, so that it can serve as a reference.

This enables the calculation of instantaneous evaporation rates at any moment during the day, as well as the total daytime evaporation rate, using equations (4.52) and (4.53), respectively.

This is illustrated in Figure 4.12, which shows the evolution of EF over a long drying period, with the evaporative fraction decreasing as the soil moisture decreases."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the self-preservation approximation for practical applications in hydrology?", "answer": "The self-preservation approximation has significant implications for practical applications in hydrology, as it allows for the estimation of evaporation rates and total daily latent heat flux using simplified equations.

However, the accuracy of these estimates depends on the choice of reference flux term and the specific conditions of the study area."}, {"question": "Why is the available energy (Rn - G) a suitable reference flux term for the self-preservation approximation?", "answer": "The available energy (Rn - G) is a suitable reference flux term for the self-preservation approximation because it exhibits a similar diurnal cycle to the latent heat flux (LE), allowing for a more accurate estimation of evaporation rates. This is evident from the fact that the error bars for the evaporative fraction are smaller when Rn - G is used as the reference flux term, indicating a lower uncertainty in the estimation of evaporation rates."}, {"question": "How does the self-preservation approximation account for the variability in energy fluxes during the diurnal cycle?", "answer": "The self-preservation approximation accounts for the variability in energy fluxes during the diurnal cycle by assuming that the ratios of the different energy flux components remain approximately constant during the daytime hours.

This principle states that mass cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed, which means that any change in the mass of water within a control volume must be accounted for by inflows and outflows. By applying this principle, water budget methods can accurately determine unknown terms, such as evaporation, by ensuring that the total mass of water entering and leaving the system is balanced. This approach relies on the precise measurement or estimation of all other terms in the equation, highlighting the importance of accurate data in the successful application of water budget methods."}, {"question": "In the context of comparing hydrologic methods, how do water budget methods differ from mass transfer or energy budget methods?", "answer": "Water budget methods differ from mass transfer or energy budget methods primarily in their approach to analyzing the hydrologic cycle.

{"paragraph": "4.4.1 Terrestrial water budget Over a landsurface of area A, the mean evaporation rate can be expressed in terms of the water balance equation (1.10), which for the present purpose can be rewritten as follows E P Q Q (4.54) ri gi ro go where P isthearealmeanrateofprecipitation, Q and Q arethetotalsurfaceinflowand outflowrates(intheriversystem), and arethetotalgroundwaterinflowandoutflow rates,respectively,allperunitarea,and Sisthewatervolumestoredperunitarea.Ifthearea isanaturalriverbasinorsomeotherhydrologiccatchment,boundedbynaturaldivides,the groundwater terms are normally negligible and the surface inflow Q is zero or, in case of artificialinterbasinwaterexchange,itisusuallyknownexactly.Hence,if R (Q Q ) is the mean net surface runoff rate per unit area from the basin, Equation (4.54) can be simplified to E P R (4.55) Even with reliable data on precipitation and runoff, Equation (4.55) still contains the two unknowns E and S; thus to close (4.55), either it must be applied over sufficiently long periods, so that becomes less important, or an additional equation is required to determine S.Thewaterstorageinthebasinisnoteasilydetermined.Itcanoftenbeassumed that the storage returns to the same value at the end or the beginning of the same season in the previous year; therefore, an annual period is usually considered long enough to make negligible. Several methods have been proposed to apply Equation (4.55) to periods shorter than a year by using indirect methods to estimate the change in storage. water budget methods Closure by relating storage to evaporation Inthisclassofmethodstheadditionalequationisobtainedbyrelating E to S.Forinstance, was assumed to represent the water storage S in the basin and the value of was taken as a layer of 10–20 cm water, to be obtained by calibration with seasonal and regional E, P, R,S = + variations. The method can be applied with average monthly values of (S and (S ), in which the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the beginning and the end of the month. The calculations can be carried out by successive approximations as follows. An initial value of S is chosen at random for the first month. Substitution of (4.33) into (4.55) yields an equation for S and without E; with an initial value of S chosen at random for the first month this produces a first estimate of S , which when substituted in (4.33) produces E for the first month. The same procedure is carried out for the second month, with S of the first serving as S of the second, and so on. The sum of all these monthly values can be compared with the total annual value of (P R). The ratio of the two should allow a proportional adjustment of the assumed value of S of the first month, and the process can be started over again and continued until the calculated annual E equals the recorded (P R). The main weakness of any method based on a relationship such as (4.33) is, beside the question of the validity of this proportionality, first the unknown value of the maximal water content parameter , and second the rather ambiguousmeaningofthepotentialevaporationconcept.Budyko’smethodhasbeenapplied extensively over various regions of the former USSR. A very similar method has also been proposed by Thornthwaite and Mather (1955; see also Steenhuis and VanderMolen, Closure by relating storage to stream flow In a second class of methods the additional equation is obtained by relating S with the runoff R from the basin, usually during recessions of the river flow, i.e. during drought flows in the absence of precipitation, so that P does not have to be considered in Equation been done by means of kinematic functions, which can be written in the form S K (4.56) is another example of the lumped kinematic approach; after elimination of S, in principle it should thus be possible to determine E from streamflow data. The parameters K and m can be determined by calibration under conditions of negligible E. The main drawback of the application of Equation (4.56) in this context, is that the storage S in (4.56) refers mainly to groundwater storage and not to near-surface soil moisture which feeds most of theevaporativeprocessesinthebasin.Thismeansthatrecessionflowsaresensitiveonlyto evaporationfromareas,wheretherootsofthevegetationareindirectcontactwiththewater table.Hencetheevaporationdeterminedthiswayoriginatesmostlyfromtheriparianzone, and not from areas further away from the stream channels, where the vegetation and the groundwaterareessentiallyuncoupled.The S variableinEquation(4.56),whichdrivesthe streamflow R, can be assumed to represent total basin storage, only after the soil moisture has been totally depleted, that is after a long recession. This difficulty can be avoided, as shown by Dias and Kan (1999), by integrating Equa- (cid:9)t, tion (4.55) over sufficiently long budget periods at the end of which most of the water evaporation Fig.4.13 Meanmonthlyclimatology Jangada River basin (1975--1990) ofprecipitation, precipitation streamflow streamflowandseasonal SWB evapotranspiration waterbudgetevaporation (SWB)estimatesforthe Jangadariverbasin(1055 50◦20(cid:5)W),whichismainly coveredbyforest vegetation.Winterand summerarewelldefined, butprecipitationisfairly uniformthroughoutthe year.(FromDiasandKan, Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec storage consists of groundwater only, so that (4.56) can be used to determine S. The begin- ning of the budget period can be taken as the end of the previous recession, when again (4.56) can be used to determine S.

In this approach the budget periods are of variable duration, and are taken to be at least one month long. The method was implemented by assuming that the system is linear, that is 1 in (4.56), and was determined from the lower envelope of a plot of daily flows versus the flow on the next day, i.e. Q versus Q during long recessions, while P 0(cf.Figure10.30);thelowerenvelopewasassumedtorepresentconditionsof small or negligible evaporation from the basin. Some results obtained with this approach are illustrated in Figure 4.13; in this particular case, it can be seen that even though the rainfall does not display a seasonal dependency, the seasonal signal is well reflected in the calculated evaporation. A similar approach to derive evaporation was used by Wittenberg and Sivapalan (1999). Finally, in a third class of methods the additional equation needed to close (4.55) is derived from the atmospheric water budget.

Just like the terrestrial water budget, it is based on an integral form of Equation (1.10), which states that the total inflow minus outflow of water mass equals the time rate of change of stored water in the control volume. Thus for a control volume consisting of an atmospheric water budget methods column of base area A with periphery C, this can readily (Brutsaert, 1982) be shown (cid:8) (cid:8) (q ) (4.57) E P V dC dp where E and P are evaporation and precipitation intensity averaged over A, W is the total water vapor content per unit surface area of the control volume, is the specific humid- ity along the vertical boundary, V is the horizontal wind component normal to the same boundarypointingoutward, isthepressure,withsubscriptssandtreferringtothesurface and the top of the column, and the water content in the solid and liquid phases is neglected. Equation (4.57) states that the difference between the average rate of evaporation and pre- cipitation over a given area of the Earth’s surface equals the rate of increase of water vapor over the area plus the total flux directed away from the region. In the past this method has been used primarily over water surfaces (for a review of the early work, see Brutsaert, 1982). Among the first applications over land was the anal- ysis of Benton and Estoque (1954) for the North American continent, followed by those of Rasmusson (1971) and Magyar et al. (1978) for the USA.

{"paragraph": "4.5 EVAPORATION CLIMATOLOGY InChapter1itwaspointedoutthatonaglobalbasistheannualevaporationisoftheorder of 1 m, which balances the annual precipitation. Table 1.1 indicates that the evaporation from the land surfaces of the Earth is around 0.5 m, which is roughly two-thirds of the mean annual precipitation. Interestingly, practical experience and folk wisdom suggest values similar to those given in Tables 1.1 and 1.2. For example, irrigation engineers, when lacking better information, sometimes use the rule of thumb that the duty of water for a well-irrigated crop is around 1 l s ha Similarly, farmers in the northeastern United States are said to require a weekly rainfall of about one inch, that is 2.5 cm, to maintain field crops in good condition during their active growing period. With typical irrigation efficiencies of 25% to 40%, and a growing season of 4–5 months, both practical estimates of the evaporative requirements in agriculture are consistent with global climatological values of around 0.50 m y However, because precipitation and the radiative energy supply are highly variable over the surface of the Earth, the actual evaporation is usually quite different from these long-term climatological mean values. Over periods shorter than a year, deviations of evaporationfromthemeancanbecharacterizedbyacyclicorperiodicbehavior,namely with a daily and with a seasonal time scale. In the extreme case of an arid, warm climate, with a pronounced dry and wet season, the seasonal evaporation cycle is similar to the evaporation climatology J F M A M J J A S O N D J Fig.4.16 Measuredmonthlyevapotranspirationratesinmm/dformeadowcoversonlysimetersatfour locationsintheeasternUnitedStates.ThedataatSeabrook,NJ(diamonds),Waynesville,NC Coshocton,OH(circles)areactualvalues,possiblyaffectedbyirregularrainfallandmoisturedeficits inthesoilprofile.Theannualmeanvaluesare2.44mmd−1 atSeabrook,2.16mmd−1 atWaynesville, and2.29mmd−1 atCoshocton.(AfterVanBavel,1961.) rainfall cycle. In a humid climate, or over water, the seasonal march of the evaporation rate follows closely the cycle of energy available for evaporation. In most climates over land the seasonal evaporation cycle is affected both by the available water and by the available energy. As an example, in Figure 4.16 the monthly mean evaporation rates are shown for several locations in the eastern United States. Thus, the cyclic behavior here is similar to the solar radiation input and to that of the air temperature. The same holds true for shallow water bodies. But over deep water bodies the evaporation cycle does not coincide with the solar winter–summer cycle. In contrast to a landsurface, a water body can store and release large amounts of heat and thus its temperature responds only slowly to energy inputs, not unlike the way a fly wheel responds to torque; as a result the cycle of available energy for evaporation may lag several months behind the solar input cycle. For example, the rate of evaporation from Lake Ontario is maximal in fall and early winter, and minimal in late spring and early summer (Phillips, 1978), as is also shown in Figure 4.17; the corresponding net radiation and heat storage are shown in Figure 4.18. The daily evaporation cycle is usually more pronounced over land than over water. Overland,wheremuchlessheatisconductedbelowthesurface,thedailycyclegenerally follows the daily march of the solar radiation. Illustrations of the daily cycles of evapo- transpiration from different surfaces are shown in Figures 2.19–2.22 and in Figure 4.9, together with other components of the surface energy budget. In Figure 4.19 an example is shown of the daily cycle of evaporation from bare soil. This figure also illustrates the general behavior of evaporation after a rainfall or after irrigation, when the available water stored in the soil profile is gradually being depleted. Because the experiment took place during a drying period, the daily cycle is superimposed on a trend of decreasing Fig.4.17 Monthlyevaporation (inmmmonth−1)from LakeOntarioduring 1972–1973,asweighted averagevaluesof estimatesbymeansof masstransfer,energy balanceandwater budgetmethods.The weightingfactorswere basedontheinverseof eachmethod’serror variances.(AfterQuinn andDenHartog,1981.)

Finally, Figure 4.20 shows an example of the cyclic behavior of evaporation as observed under the extreme conditions of an arctic tundra environment. Remarkably, in spite of the harsh environment, the annual evaporation of 140 mm still amounts to more than one quarter of the global mean value over land. REFERENCES Asanuma, J. and Brutsaert, W.

When the flow is turbulent, this is conveniently transformed intotheReynoldsequationforthemeanquantities.TheReynoldsequationcanbereadily obtained from Equation (1.12), by replacing each of the dependent variables by the sum of its mean and fluctuation, both in the turbulence sense, and by subsequently applying the time-averaging operation over a suitable time period. For the two-dimensional case of incompressible flow under consideration, and with a source inflow , the component of Equation (1.12) parallel to the bottom surface can be written as follows (cid:3) (cid:4) ∂u ∂u ∂u ∂p v(cid:2)) u(cid:2) ∂t ∂x ∂z ρ ∂x in which (u k) is the turbulent fluctuation in the velocity vector v i v j v (cid:2)). (v Observe that (5.14), without the last two terms on the right-hand side, is in the form of Euler’s equation (1.11); these two terms represent respectively the stresses due to viscosity and the Reynolds stresses due to the turbulence.

With a no-slip condition at 0, this is never the case; nevertheless, in turbulent open channel flow, which is well mixed in the vertical, it is usually an acceptable approximation. However, for laminar and transitional flows, a correction coefficient (often associated with the name of Boussinesq; see Bakhmeteff, 1941), namely, β = (u/V)2dz/h may have to be applied to the first term on the right-hand side of (5.18), i.e. the advective acceleration term. The integration of the other terms in Equation (5.15) is straightforward. The third term on the left yields upon integration simply the product of and at h. If it can be assumed that is small, the first term on the right can be approximated by −sinθ −tanθ = replacing by , which is the slope of the bottom surface, so that its integral becomes (gS h). Similarly, the pressure gradient in the second term on the right canbereplacedbythewaterdepthgradientonaccountof (5.7),providedtheslopeangle is small enough. In the hydraulic approach to free surface flow, the integral of the last two terms of Equation (5.15) is usually expressed in terms of the friction slope , as a closure parameterization to account for the effects of the viscosity and the turbulence.

This result is often written in an alternative form, which is obtained by subtraction of continuity (5.13) multiplied by V, and by subsequent division by h; thus the momentum equation is often written as follows (cid:3) (cid:4) ∂V ∂V ∂h 0 (5.22) ∂t ∂x ∂x Equations (5.13 and (5.22) are known as the shallow water equations; a simpler version was first presented by Saint Venant in the nineteenth century, so that they are often named after him. To recapitulate briefly, the shallow water equations are based on the following assumptions. (i) The pressure distribution in the water is hydrostatic sinθ tanθ = −S of viscous and turbulent stresses can be parameterized and combined in a friction slope Equation (5.19) can be taken as unity. Example 5.1. Steady flow The meaning of the different terms in Equation (5.22) can be illustrated by considering steady flow conditions in the absence of lateral inflow.

Recall that the bed slope is sufficiently small, so that x, the coordinate along the bed, can be represented as horizontal in the figure. Because the integration of a force (or rate of momentum change) over distance yields work, the terms of Equation (5.23) may be considered as different forms of energy. In open channel hydraulics the energy per unit weight with respect to the channel bottom is called the energy; in the present specific + V2/(2g)]. notation this is [h As shown in Figure 5.2, its elevation defines the (EGL); the friction slope is the slope of the energy grade line. The quantity grade line S + p/(ρg)] [z in any cross section defines the (HGL); because this hydraulic grade line is equal to the water depth h, the HGL coincides with the water surface.

{"paragraph": "5.3.2 Turbulent flow For Reynolds numbers larger than 1000, free surface flow in nature may generally be considered fully turbulent and rough, with little or no effect from the impact of lateral inflow. Unlike laminar flow, however, even when it is steady and uniform, there is no exact solution available for turbulent flow. As was the case for the analogous turbulence closure problem in the atmosphere discussed in Chapter 2, the main difficulty here is the presence of the second moments of the velocity fluctuations, that is the Reynolds determine) this unknown shear stress is either to invoke similarity theory or to rely entirely on empirical results. Similarity for two-dimensional turbulent flow Uniform two-dimensional turbulent flow can be considered as a fully developed boundary layer. For rough flow conditions, which are usually the case for flow over a natural land- surface, the velocity profile in the inner region of the neutral boundary layer is given by Equations (2.40) or (2.41). Strictly speaking, one can apply this logarithmic profile only in water on the land surface thelower10%to20%oftheboundarylayerthickness;intheouterreachesoftheboundary layer, some type of velocity defect law is more appropriate. However, in two-dimensional free surface flow this defect law (see, for example, Keulegan, 1938) is often assumed to be (cid:3) (cid:4) ln (5.34) which implies that Equation (2.40) can be used over the whole depth of the flow. This is apparently only an approximation, but in laboratory type turbulent boundary layers the difference between Equations (2.40) or (5.34) and observed velocity profiles in the outer velocity can be expressed roughly (for ) as ln (5.35) or (when also ), As an aside, it should be mentioned that one possible problem with the application of V/(gh)1/2 (2.40) to open channel flow is that may be a function of Froude number Fr of water flowing down a slope may also be affected by gravity, g, beside the variables that were considered in the derivation of Equation (2.40). A second potential difficulty is the effect of the raindrop impact. For instance, Kisisel (1973) showed that for shallow flows with values around 15 mm and a high rainfall intensity of 125 mm the measured velocity profiles (u were logarithmic, but the resulting values would be only about half the magnitude predicted by (5.36). For less shallow flows, however, the effect of rainfall impact is likely to be small.

In two-dimensional flow situations and wide channels, the hydraulic radius equals the depth of the flow, or h.

This suggests that for a given channel can only be truly constant for highly turbulent flow, or for very high Reynolds numbers Another very popular formula is the Gauckler–Manning (GM) equation, named after the two engineers who contributed most to its development (see Powell, 1962; 1968; Williams, 1970; 1971). It is usually written as S1/2 R2/3 The constant is referred to as the channel roughness coefficient, when the variables are expressed in SI units. Numerous experiments have been carried out to determine it for all kinds of channels and surfaces. Some values are shown in Table 5.1, but more detailed results for a wider range of conditions can be found in Chow (1959) and in be derived theoretically by assuming a power law such as (5.37) with This indicatesthattheGMformulacanbeexpectedtobevalidoverarangeoflowerReynolds numbers than Ch´ ezy’s, which requires the extreme value 0 for a perfectly uniform velocity profile.

In any event, the power law assumption, on which the GM equation is implicitly based, should be adequate for most practical applications.

Wooding (1965) interpreted this phenomenon by noting that, owing to fluctuations in depth and roughness over an irregular surface, the flow regime can vary spatially and temporally between laminar and turbulent; in addition, even when the flow near the water surface is turbulent, the flow within the lower layers between the grass stems and leaves may be more like laminar seepage through a porous medium.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of turbulent flow in natural channels, what is the primary challenge in determining the shear stress?", "answer": "The primary challenge is the presence of the second moments of the velocity fluctuations, which makes it difficult to determine the unknown shear stress without invoking similarity theory or relying on empirical results."}, {"question": "How does the velocity profile in the inner region of a neutral boundary layer differ from that in the outer reaches for rough flow conditions?", "answer": "For rough flow conditions, the velocity profile in the inner region of the neutral boundary layer is given by a logarithmic profile, such as Equations (2.40) or (2.41), whereas in the outer reaches, a velocity defect law is more appropriate. However, in two-dimensional free surface flow, the logarithmic profile is often assumed to be applicable over the whole depth of the flow as an approximation."}, {"question": "Why is the application of Equation (2.40) to open channel flow potentially problematic?", "answer": "The application of Equation (2.40) to open channel flow is potentially problematic because it does not account for the effect of the Froude number and gravity on the flow, and it also does not consider the impact of raindrop impact on the velocity profile, especially for shallow flows. For instance, Kisisel (1973) showed that for shallow flows with high rainfall intensity, the measured velocity profiles were logarithmic but with values significantly lower than those predicted by Equation (5.36)."}, {"question": "In what ways can the turbulent velocity profile be expressed, and what are the implications of using different expressions?", "answer": "The turbulent velocity profile can be expressed either by a logarithmic function, such as Equation (2.40), or by a power function, such as Equation (5.37). The use of a power function, like Equation (5.37), provides a simpler expression for the velocity profile and has been applied in various turbulent transport problems. The parameters in the power function can be determined by fitting the equation to the more accurate logarithmic profile over a range of heights. This approach has been used to derive empirical equations, such as the Gauckler-Manning equation, which relates the average velocity to the hydraulic radius and the friction slope."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Gauckler-Manning equation in the context of open channel flow, and how does it relate to the logarithmic velocity profile?", "answer": "The Gauckler-Manning equation is a widely used empirical equation for open channel flow that relates the average velocity to the hydraulic radius and the friction slope. It is based on the assumption of a power-law velocity profile, which is a simplification of the more complex logarithmic profile. The equation is significant because it provides a practical and relatively accurate method for calculating the average velocity in open channels, especially for fully turbulent flow conditions. The Gauckler-Manning equation can be derived theoretically by assuming a power law with specific values for the parameters, which indicates that it can be expected to be valid over a range of lower Reynolds numbers than other equations, such as Chézy's."}, {"question": "How do the Chézy and Gauckler-Manning equations compare in terms of their underlying assumptions and applicability?", "answer": "The Chézy equation is based on the assumption of a logarithmic velocity profile and is applicable for highly turbulent flow conditions, whereas the Gauckler-Manning equation is based on a power-law velocity profile and is applicable for a wider range of flow conditions, including lower Reynolds numbers. The Chézy equation requires the flow to be highly turbulent, with a uniform velocity profile, whereas the Gauckler-Manning equation can accommodate more variability in the flow regime. The comparison between the two equations highlights the importance of considering the underlying assumptions and limitations of each equation when applying them to different flow conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of open channel flow, why do empirical equations, such as the Chézy and Gauckler-Manning equations, remain widely used despite the availability of more theoretical approaches?", "answer": "Empirical equations, such as the Chézy and Gauckler-Manning equations, remain widely used in open channel flow because they provide simple and relatively accurate methods for calculating the average velocity and friction slope. These equations have been extensively tested and validated through numerous experiments and field measurements, making them reliable tools for engineers and hydrologists. Although more theoretical approaches, such as the logarithmic velocity profile, can provide more detailed insights into the flow dynamics, they often require more complex calculations and may not be as straightforward to apply in practice. The empirical equations, on the other hand, offer a practical balance between simplicity and accuracy, making them preferred choices for many applications."}, {"question": "How does the value of the exponent 'a' in the empirical equation for open channel flow relate to the flow regime, and what are the implications of different values of 'a'?", "answer": "The value of the exponent 'a' in the"}]}

This is particularly significant in understanding the dynamics of water flow over land surfaces, where the rate of flow per unit width can vary significantly due to factors such as rainfall intensity and surface roughness.

For laminar flow, these constants help in defining the smooth, continuous flow behavior, while for turbulent flow, they account for the chaotic, irregular flow patterns. The accurate determination of these constants, as guided by Equation (5.33), is vital for correctly applying the friction slope parameterization to either flow regime, ensuring that hydrological models accurately capture the underlying physics of water flow."}, {"question": "In the context of water flow over land surfaces, how does the distinction between laminar and turbulent flow regimes impact hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The distinction between laminar and turbulent flow regimes significantly impacts hydrological modeling because each regime has distinct flow characteristics that affect how water moves over the land. Laminar flow is characterized by smooth, orderly layers, while turbulent flow is marked by chaotic, mixing motions. This distinction is critical in hydrological modeling because the choice of friction slope parameterization depends on the dominant flow regime, influencing predictions of runoff, infiltration, and other hydrological processes.

The form of Equation (5.51) describes actually two waves, each with a speed of prop- agation (relative to a reference moving with the fluid velocity of the undisturbed flow), but traveling in opposite directions. To distinguish the speed of propagation of a disturbance or of a wave, from the velocity of the fluid itself, it is common to refer to it as celerity. As an illustration, consider now the case where represents the water surface elevation , which is the easiest to visualize.

Consider a wide uniform channel extending to from the (moving) origin at 0.Assumeasinitialconditionsthatthevariable f(x )andalsoitstimederivative (∂y/∂t = ) g(x ) are known for any value of .

Thus the solution (5.51) can be written for this case as m 0 m m 0 m which is commonly attributed to d’Alembert. This result (5.54) is equally applicable to the water surface depth , the velocity and the rate of flow . However, in each case the functions f(x ) and g(x ) should represent the initial conditions of the intended variable. Example 5.4.

Semi-infinite channel with known upstream inflow A situation which has been the subject of many studies is that of a channel reach, with a given inflow at its upstream end. If the upstream end is taken as the origin, where 0, the boundary and initial conditions can be written as 0;x 0;t 0 These conditions can now be used with Equation (5.49) to solve the problem. However, rather than to attempt a frontal attack, it is convenient here to make use of the d’Alembert solution (5.58) for the unit impulse derived in the previous example, and by inspection of Figure 5.7. This shows immediately that the component of that solution moving to the left away from 0 can be considered an image, and that the component moving into the domain 0 is the desired result. Thus one has the unit response function, that is the solution for an input at 0, )t) (5.60) If the input at 0 is actually (t) instead of a delta function, the solution can be readily obtained by convolution. For instance, in the case where y(t) represents the flow general considerations rate disturbance , the solution resulting from an inflow (t) at 0 is )(t (5.61) or, upon integration, (t )) (5.62) To repeat briefly the results of this section, general solutions of the dynamic part of the shallow water equations result in two waves; their speed of propagation (gh relative to the mean motion, is also known as Lagrange’s celerity equation (cf. Equation (5.50)). One of these “dynamic” waves is moving in the direction of the current and the other against the current.

The paths of these two observers traced on the plane are called characteristics. From the above analysis it follows that these characteristics can be defined by the ordinary differential equations = +(gh = and (5.64) = −(gh = The concept of characteristics, which is being introduced here in an offhand way, arises formally in the theory of partial differential equations. However, this is beyond the scope of the present discussion. For an introduction to the mathematics, the reader is referred to such books as Sommerfeld (1949), and on the application of characteristics to free surface flow to Stoker (1957) or Abbott (1975).

The second part, given by Equation (5.74), constitutes the main body of the wave. Mathematically, the Heaviside step function eliminates singularities from this part of the solution. Physically, the unit step function guarantees that this part will never forge ahead fasterorfurtherthanthepositionofthedynamicfront t),givenbyEquation(5.73), and it ensures that the first part given by (5.73) represents indeed the leading edge of the disturbance caused by the unit impulse at 0. The celerity of the main body of the wave can be determined from the mean travel time of the wave. This mean time of occurrence m(cid:2) of a wave is the first moment about the origin, denoted as or this is also called its centroid or center of area. Therefore, the travel time is the difference between the mean time of occurrence of the wave at the point of observation and that at the origin 0, that is the time for its center of gravity to reach x.

The behavior of kinematic waves is also influenced by the Froude number, but their celerity is generally slower than that of dynamic waves.

The linear analysis illustrates the separate existence of these two types of waves and their distinct behaviors, including their speeds, decay rates, and interactions. However, in real-world situations, the nonlinear nature of the shallow water equations leads to interactions between dynamic and kinematic waves, resulting in more complex flow phenomena.

{"paragraph": "5.4.2 The diffusion analogy: a first approximation In many situations encountered in nature, the flow velocities change relatively slowly, so that the acceleration (inertia or dynamic) terms and often are rather small compared to the other terms in the governing equations. For example, it was noted by Iwasaki (1967), that in the upper Kitakami, a river some 195 km long draining an area of 7860 in northern Honshu, these inertia terms were observed to be at most 1.5%, and usually smaller than 1% of the stage gradient ].

This is the outflow rate at a distance downstream from the point 0 where the flow rate perturbation is a delta function or (t) The unit response can then be used with (5.71) to calculate the result for any arbitrary function (t). The diffusion equation has been thoroughly studied (see, for example, Carslaw and Jaeger, 1986) for various boundary conditions. It can be readily shown that this unit response function can be written as (cid:3) (cid:4) exp (5.95) This solution has a form which is closely related to the Gaussian or normal distribution in which the position of the mean is (c t) and the spatial variance (2D t). Thus this unit response confirms that the main body of this wave, that is its centroid, moves downstream with a celerity, given by the advectivity of Equation (5.91). It also shows how the diffusivity causes dispersion or spreading of the wave as it moves along.

Finally, Figure 5.9 illustrates how for small values of the volume under the curve is smaller than unity; for instance, the curve at is lower than the corresponding diffusion result. This merely illustrates the fact that for small values of the dynamic wave part is still not negligible; for instance, as mentioned above, at in Equation (5.79) the term x+) is still 0.411; but it rapidly decays with increasing x+.

This way it can be seen that it is mainly the third term in (5.22), namely which is responsible for the diffusion character of the resulting equation. Indeed, when this third term is also omitted, the resulting formulation loses its diffusion character, as will be shown in Section 5.4.3. However, it should be noted that this is not the only way to obtain a linear diffusion equation for free surface flow. It is also possible to start from the complete linear system (5.67) and to modify (rather than eliminate) the second derivatives involving time by means of the quasi-steady- uniform flow or kinematic wave assumption (see Section 5.4.3; also Brutsaert, 1973).

Specifically, for a wide channel, the celerity can be approximated using the equation derived from the kinematic wave theory, which shows that the wave speed is a function of the hydraulic radius and the rate of increase in the wetted perimeter with depth. This relationship highlights the importance of channel geometry in determining wave propagation characteristics and flow behavior."}, {"question": "What are the key factors that influence the choice between using the kinematic wave approach versus other flow modeling approaches in hydrological applications?", "answer": "The choice between the kinematic wave approach and other flow modeling approaches depends on several key factors, including the nature of the flow (e.g., steady vs. unsteady, uniform vs. non-uniform), the significance of frictional resistance, and the scale of the system being modeled. The kinematic wave approach is particularly suited for applications where frictional resistance is high, and dynamic effects are less significant, such as in natural channels with rough beds or in urban drainage systems. In contrast, dynamic wave models may be more appropriate for systems where inertial effects are important, such as in reservoirs or large, smooth channels."}, {"question": "How does the concept of wave celerity, as derived from the kinematic wave approach, relate to the translation of disturbances in a channel without distortion?", "answer": "The concept of wave celerity, as derived from the kinematic wave approach, is directly related to the translation of disturbances in a channel without distortion. According to the kinematic wave theory, a disturbance introduced at one point in the channel will propagate downstream at a constant velocity, given by the wave celerity, without undergoing any deformation. This means that the shape and amplitude of the disturbance remain unchanged as it moves downstream, which is a characteristic feature of kinematic wave propagation. This concept is important for understanding how changes in flow conditions or channel geometry can affect the behavior of waves and disturbances in hydrological systems."}, {"question": "In what ways does the quasi-steady-uniform flow approximation simplify the analysis of flow in channels, and what are the limitations of this approach?", "answer": "The quasi-steady-uniform flow approximation simplifies the analysis of flow in channels by neglecting dynamic terms and focusing on the effects of gravity and friction.

Under conditions of turbulent flow this assumption may be a good approximation but, as seen in Table 5.2, under conditions of laminar flow the additional resistance may be considerable. This effect can be incorporated in the recession analysis as follows. Let denote the parameter in Equation (6.8) under conditions of rainfall impact, and the same parameter in the absence of rain.

With the expressions given in Table 5.2, this increased flow rate is roughly (1 times the equilibrium flow rate iL; for instance, with a slope = 0.001 = 0.3 and a rainfall intensity cm , this indicates a sudden increase of 38%. But in actual flow situations this sudden increase is unlikely to be that large, and the value predicted by Equation (6.37) can only be considered as an upper limit. Indeed, a sudden change in shear stress resulting from the cessation of the rainfall, must also involve accelerations, which are neglected in the kinematic approach leading to (6.37), and which will tend to offset this effect. Moreover, even if it were to occur, the spike is rapidly dissipated. Finally, natural rainfall events never cease suddenly, but they tend to decrease rather gradually.

Figure 6.11 illustrates that the lumped kinematic approach does not really produce a verygoodmathematicaldescriptionofoverlandflow,ascomparedwiththekinematicwave solution, which is known to provide a close approximation to the exact solution. Thus the question can be raised how the experimental results could be described so well by the lumped approach in Izzard’s (1946) study.

{"paragraph": "7.1.1 Surge or dynamic shock Under certain conditions the water surface exhibits an obvious and visible disturbance, alsovariouslycalledanabruptwave,asurge,aboreoramovinghydraulicjump.Similar phenomena occur in other situations in the environment as well, and they constitute the front of what are broadly referred to as gravity currents (Simpson, 1997). For instance, in Chapter 3 analogous surges were seen to occur as the gust front of thunderstorms (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9). Any such disturbance may be interpreted, if not as a discontinuity, at least as a point where the water depth is not a smooth function; this interpretation means that the of the flow around such a wave, whether it will amplify or decay. As already noted in Chapter 5 on the basis of the solution of the linear case, the criterion for bore formation However, the instantaneous speed of propagation of such a wave depends solely on the magnitude of the discontinuity itself, as will now be shown. Types of abrupt wave In general, there are four different types of abrupt wave. A simple way of visualizing them makes use of a thought experiment illustrated in Figure 7.1. Consider a sluice gateunderwell-establishedsteadyflowconditions,whoseopeningissuddenlychanged. If the gate is raised, the downstream flow can be seen to develop situation A and the upstream flow develops situation C. If the sudden change is downward, situations B and D develop, respectively upstream and downstream from the gate. Waves in class A move downstream as positive surges; these types of bore are the ones of primary interest in hydrology, as they can transport large amounts of water and have caused some major flooding events in the past. Waves of type B are also positive surges, but in contrast to A, they advance upstream. They are typical for tidal bores, which are observed in some estuaries and rivers affected by tidal action. Such bores can be formed when the rising tide reverses the river flow and the tidal water enters into a gradually narrowing and shallowing channel, usually with a small bed slope; this narrowing environment slows down the leading edge of the tide, and allows it to be overtaken by the deeper and faster traveling water of the continually rising tide coming up from the rear. Although the survey was not totally exhaustive, at last count (Bartsch-Winkler and Lynch, 1988), streamflow routing Fig.7.1 Generationofthefourdifferenttypesofabruptwavebythesuddenmovementofthesluicegate.

Waves of type C are upstream moving negative surges, which have on occasion been observed in hydropower supply canals, when the water demand is drastically stepped up. Waves of type D are downstream moving negative surges, which can result on occasion from a suddenly decreased water supply in an open channel.

In spite of these differences, the initial stages of all four types of waves can be analyzed in the same way, as will be shown next. Analysis of flood wave The problem is most easily analyzed from a reference moving at the same velocity as thewave,sothatthephenomenonbecomesoneofsteadystate.Onemaythusassumethat and become functions of a single variable (x t) , and the partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives as follows = = −c = = and (7.1) ∂t dξ ∂t dξ ∂x dξ ∂x dξ BecausethevelocityVanddepthhvarymarkedlyandabruptlyacrossthewave,theinertia and hydrostatic pressure gradient terms are predominant in the momentum equation and, as a first approximation, the friction term and the gravity term can both be neglected. In the absence of lateral inflow, the momentum equation for a wide channel, (5.22), becomes then with (7.1) −(c − + = V) 0 (7.2) Upon multiplication by (h ) and integration between two points 1 and 2, respectively, some small but finite distance upstream and downstream from the abrupt wave (see Figure 7.2), Equation (7.2) assumes the form (cid:2) (cid:2) − − dξ + dξ (c V) (7.3) Thesameoperationscanbeappliedtothecontinuityequationforawidechannel,(5.13), streamflow routing After integration across the wave, this becomes in turn (c V) constant or (7.5) (c ) (c )h s 1 1 s 2 2 part of the first term in (7.3) is independent of Therefore after taking that part outside the integral sign, (7.3) becomes (cid:3) (cid:4) − − + − = s 1 1 1 2 Equation (7.5) can also be used to eliminate from (7.6); after substitution of s s 1 1 2 (cid:5) (cid:6) The square root term in Equation (7.7) represents the celerity of the bore relative to the velocityatcrosssection1.Becauseofsymmetry,thesubscripts1and2inEquation(7.7) can be interchanged, to yield the celerity relative to the velocity at section 2. Whenever sections 1 and 2 are defined respectively as the section upstream and the downstream from the abrupt wave, the plus sign in Equation (7.7) describes the downstream motion of surges of type A and D, and the minus sign upstream moving surges of type B and C. Thus flood waves, as encountered in hydrology require the plus sign in (7.7).

Disastrous floods Abrupt waves of type A have been associated with some extreme flooding events in the past. For instance, in the United States, the Johnstown flood is still among the largest natural disasters on record (see McCullough, 1968; Degen and Degen, 1984). The flood two extreme cases Fig.7.3 ThebrokenSouthForkdam,asseenfrominsidetheemptyreservoir.Theopeningwasabout130m widenearthetop;thespillwaycanbeseenontherightjustbelowthebridge.Ittookthefloodsurge roughly53mintoreachJohnstown.DrawingbySchellandHogan.(FromHarper’sWeekly,1889.) took place in the afternoon of May 31, 1889, after a night of heavy rain, and was caused by the failure of a badly maintained dam on South Fork Creek, some 23 km upstream along the Little Conemaugh River and some 135 m higher than the town itself. After the 15 m in some places, raged down the valley; as it reached Johnstown (at 1607), in a little less than an hour, it spread out somewhat over a wider area, but its center was still at least 10 m high. While the main event in Johnstown was over in 10 min, it left more than 2200 dead in its aftermath and near total destruction of the city. Example 7.1. Some features of the Johnstown flood Interestingly, the reported features of the Johnstown flood are not unreasonable in light of Equation (7.7), and some of them can be reconstructed with a few rough estimates of the effective parameters. Dam breach problems like this are highly unsteady in nature, and they have been the subject of intensive study (see, for example, Yevjevich, 1975). However, assume for the present example that the reservoir was large enough, resulting in a steady inflow into the river channel after the dam had failed. From the eyewitness accounts, the height of the surge appears to have been of the order of 10 m. With a = (135/23000) = mean slope of and an assumed roughness of 0.07 (see Table 5.1), Equation (5.41) yields a velocity of the water behind the surge of 5.08 m streamflow routing Assuming also (as a first approximation) that the valley cross-sectional area did not vary appreciably along the flow path, and (for want of better information) that in the valley ahead of the surge the effective water depth was of the order of 1.0 m, according to Equation (7.7) one finds that the surge came down at 7.4 m thus, it would have taken the wave about 52 min to cover the 23 km, which in fact it did. Admittedly, this result is obtained with unknown and therefore assumed values of and , and it would be possible to obtain the same value of with other equally plausible combinations. For instance, roughly the same result would be obtained with assumed values of 0.05 and 0 m, representing a smoother channel with negligible depth of flow prior to the disaster (cf. Problem 7.1). It would require a more detailed field survey and analysis to estimate which values of n, and would be appropriate for the dam-break event that took place in this valley. A notorious but less disastrous flash flood occurred on Willow Creek in the town of HeppnerinOregon,inthelateafternoononSundayJune14,1903.AccordingtoMorrow County records (see also Taylor and Hatton, 1999), it was generated by a cloudburst, which was later estimated to amount to about 35 mm over an area of some 50 mainly around Balm Fork, in the hills 10–15 km south of town. The flood waters raced into town around 1700, causing the death of some 247 inhabitants, nearly 20% of the population, and destroying one third of all structures. The of June 18, Heppner Gazette wall of water, 40 feet in height.” This surge height may well have been an overestimate. Without detailed information on the temporal and spatial distribution of that rainfall event, it is hard to know exactly how the runoff was funneled into a surge in the Willow Creek valley. Nevertheless, the suddenness and power of the flood were no doubt also exacerbated by the presence of a laundry at the upstream end of town; combined with accumulating debris, this structure at first blocked passage of the water somewhat, only to give way after a short while, abruptly releasing the built-up water mass. Other examples of this type of flood are the glacier lake outbursts caused by ice avalanches in Peru, where they are known as aluvi´ ones (see Lliboutry al., 1977; Morales-Arnao, 1999). Typically, they are triggered with almost no warning and bring down ice blocks, boulders and mud, leaving death and destruction in their path. In the past three centuries more than 22 major outburst floods have destroyed a number of towns and villages in the region. In 1941 one such aluvi´ on, caused by the failure of a moraine dam higher up in the Cordillera Blanca, destroyed about one third of the city of Huaraz and resulted in an estimated 5000–7000 deaths.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of abrupt waves, what are the four different types of waves that can occur, and how are they classified?", "answer": "The four types of abrupt waves are classified based on their direction of movement and whether they are positive or negative surges. Waves of type A and B are positive surges, with type A moving downstream and type B moving upstream. Waves of type C and D are negative surges, with type C moving upstream and type D moving downstream.

In contrast, negative surges, such as those of type C and D, are unstable because the deeper leading edge water flees away from the more shallow water, causing the sharp front to spread out and lose its definition. This difference in behavior is due to the direction of the water movement and the resulting interactions between the deeper and shallower water."}, {"question": "In the context of flood waves, how do the effects of bed slope and resistance impact the analysis of abrupt waves, and what are the implications for predicting flood wave behavior?", "answer": "The effects of bed slope and resistance can play an important role in the analysis of abrupt waves, particularly when the wave travels over large distances in a natural river. While the simplified analysis presented in the paragraph neglects these factors, they can significantly impact the behavior of the wave, including its speed and stability. For example, a steep bed slope can increase the speed of the wave, while resistance can slow it down.

Itsrateof propagationisgiven byEquation(7.9). are frictional resistance and gravity. It is often considered the kinematic equivalent of the dynamic shock, because the wave front constitutes a moving transition between two regions of essentially uniform flow. Again, the problem can be analyzed within a reference frame moving at the same equation, or In a perfect kinematic system this result suggests a discontinuity in or in its deriva- tive, because in order to keep a constant, must also be constant, even though q(h) is nonlinear. This is the reason why the monoclinal rising wave has also been referred to as a kinematic shock. In actual rivers, however, flood rises, which are subject mainly (but never only) to the effects of gravity and friction, usually do not display any such discontinuities and they are quite continuous and smooth; they usually extend over large distances and the transition or shock thickness may be considerable. In view of this ambiguity, the question arises whether the type of motion predicted by Equation (7.9) can even exist or maintain itself in the real world. The matter can be resolved by consid- eringthefullequationofmotion(5.22)todetermineunderwhatconditionsdiffusionand wave steepening might be in balance, to allow the stability of the uniformly progressive flow assumed in the derivation of (7.9).

Substitution of (7.15) into the storage equation (7.11) yields the governing differential equation K(1 X) (7.16) Interpretation of the parameters Some insight can be gained in the nature of the parameters and by considering the two main features of the flood wave in progress. These features are the time it takes for the flood wave to pass through the reach, and the change in shape the flood wave streamflow routing Fig.7.6 Waterstoredinthe channelreachcontrol volumeoflengthΔx.

The mean time of occurrence of a flood wave is the first moment about the origin, denoted as or this quantity is also referred to as the centroid or center of area of the hydrograph. Therefore, the travel time is the difference between the mean time of occurrence of the wave at the exit section and that at the inflow section of the reach, (cid:4) (cid:4) that is , as shown in Figure 7.7; as before, the subscripts e and i refer to the outflow and inflow sections of the reach. In other words, that travel time is the time between the centers of area of the inflow wave (t) and of the outflow wave (t), or (cid:7) (cid:7) t Q dt t Q dt (cid:7) (cid:7) Q dt Q dt a lumped kinematic approach The integrals in the denominators of (7.17), which are the zeroth moments, are required to normalize Q; ideally, they should equal each other, if there are no lateral inflows or outflows in the reach. Substitution of (7.16) in (7.17) produces (cid:10) (cid:2) (cid:2) = −K + − t t Q Q dt Integration by parts, and imposition of the condition that both and are zero for at infinity, leads finally to the desired result In words, Equation (7.19) states that the parameter can be interpreted as a measure of the lag or the time of travel of the flood wave through the reach. Accordingly, when (cid:6)x, the channel reach has a length the celerity of a Muskingum wave is = (cid:6)x/K The width or average duration of a flood wave hydrograph, which is one of the more obviousmeasuresofitsshape,canbeconvenientlycharacterizedbyitsstandarddeviation σ,thatis,thesquarerootofitssecondmomentaboutthemean, .Thus,thechangein shapeofafloodwavehydrograph,afterpassingthroughachannelreach,canbedescribed by the difference between the second moments of the outflow and inflow hydrographs, namely (m ). Since the second moment about the mean is related to the moments about the origin as indicated in Equation (13.12), this difference can be written as − = − − + e2 i2 e1 i1 in which the difference between the two moments about the origin is (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:4) (cid:4) (m ) (7.22) (cid:7) (cid:7) Q dt Q dt As before, in (7.22) the two terms in the denominators should be equal to each other, when there are no additional in- or outflows in the reach.

Accordingly, in cases of pure reservoiraction,thatis,whenthefloodpassesthroughalevelpoolwhosestage(orlevel) iscontrolledbyaspillwayatthedownstreamend,thestorageSshouldbeindependentof the inflow rate, and therefore 0. On the other hand, in a uniform rectangular channel with a plane water surface the two sections should be weighted equally and ideally 0.5. Equation (7.25) allows now a fuller interpretation of X. Equation (7.19) already showed that the parameter is the mean residence time of the flood wave in the reach; K2 [T2]. both second moments and in (7.25) have the basic dimensions Hence 1 2X reflects the rate of increase of the (streamwise) width of the wave as it travels through the reach; because mass is conserved, 1 2X must also reflect the rate of decrease of its height, that is, the rate of subsidence of the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph. According to (7.25), the difference between the two second moments is maximal when X=0,thatisunderconditionsofpurereservoiraction.Ontheotherhand,(7.25)indicates that, when the wave does not undergo deformation, but it retains its original shape as it travels.

The combination of these parameters allows the Muskingum method to simulate the propagation of the flood wave through the reach, taking into account both the travel time and the deformation of the wave. The values of K and X can be adjusted to match the observed behavior of the flood wave, allowing for accurate simulation and prediction of flood events."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the moments of the flood wave hydrograph in the Muskingum method?", "answer": "The moments of the flood wave hydrograph are important in the Muskingum method because they provide a way to characterize the shape of the hydrograph.

To allow sufficient resolution of the temporal behavior of the flood wave, it stands to reason that(cid:6)t shouldbesmallcomparedwiththelifetimeoftheincomingflood.Therefore it is usually assumed (see Jones, 1981; Ponce and Theurer, 1982) that (cid:6)t ≤ in which is a number of the order of 4 to (preferably) 5. a lumped kinematic approach Fig.7.8 Theheavylinetriangularregion indicatesthevalidityrangeofthe Muskingumformulation.The areainsidethetriangleisdefined bytheconditionsthat0≤ 0.5andthatthecoefficientsc0, c1 andc2 bepositive,asindicated in(7.41);cm denotesthecelerity ofthewave.(AfterMillerand Cunge,1975.) 0 0.5 1.0 (cid:6)x, (iii) Several studies have dealt with the optimal length of the length of the reach but there is no general consensus in the literature.

Section 12.2.1) can be applied. In what follows, the method of least squares is presented as an example. The simple form of Equation (7.37) immediately suggests that it should be possible toestimatetheconstantcoefficientsbymultiplelinearregression.Thereis,however,one small complication, in that the coefficients must satisfy the constraint 1. This constraint can be incorporated by defining the variables , and , and by recasting (7.37) as follows i2 e1 2 i1 e1 y c x c x which can be considered as a linear regression equation of on and , forced through the origin. By applying the method of least squares to Equation (7.43) it can readily be shown that optimal values of the coefficients can be calculated with the following yx yx x x (cid:11) (cid:11) and (7.44) yx yx x x (cid:11) (cid:11) and, of course, 1 . The summations can be performed over the time range for which the hydrographs are available; this will yield values of the coefficients, which perform well “on average” (in the least squares sense). However, if certain features of the hydrograph require greater accuracy, such as for example the flows in the vicinity of the peak discharge, it may be desirable to perform the summation over a more narrow time range. With these three coefficients , and determined, Equation (7.37) can be applied to solve any routing problem. In case the Muskingum parameters are needed for one or other reason, they can be calculated from these coefficients by inversion of (7.38), that is by using and (7.45) Example 7.3. Application of the multiple regression method The and hydrographs of Example 7.2, as listed in Table 7.2 and shown in Figure 7.10, can be used to illustrate the method. The reader can verify that the sums needed in (7.44) have the following values: 2 772 315, 1 942 872, (cid:11) (cid:11) =3838571,and =5454548(intheunitsofTable7.2squared). 8383823, With Equation (7.44) these yield the following values of the coefficients 0.018, streamflow routing 0.480 and 0.502; with Equation (7.45) the corresponding Muskingum param- eters are 1.97 h and 0.24. All these values are close to the corresponding ones obtained in Example 7.2 using the standard trial-and-error procedure; in fact, a plot of the resulting hydrograph would be difficult to distinguish from the curve shown in Figure 7.10 for 1.99 h and 0.3.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the Muskingum method for streamflow routing, how are the parameters and estimated?", "answer": "The parameters and are estimated from available data of inflow and outflow in a given reach of interest.

This method does not rely on objective criteria to determine optimality, making the selection of X somewhat arbitrary and dependent on the user's judgment.

However, this approach may not perform as well \"on average\" over the entire time range of the hydrograph. Therefore, the choice of time range depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired level of accuracy."}, {"question": "In the context of the Muskingum method, how do the values of X affect the relationship between the storage in the reach and the weighted flow rate?", "answer": "The value of X affects the relationship between the storage in the reach and the weighted flow rate by determining the shape of the curve. Different values of X can result in different curves, with some values producing a more linear relationship and others resulting in a more curved or looped relationship. The optimal value of X is the one that produces a single-valued straight line without a loop, which is used to estimate the Muskingum parameters."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to determine the optimal value of X in the standard trial-and-error procedure for estimating Muskingum parameters?", "answer": "Determining the optimal value of X is challenging because the relationship between the storage in the reach and the weighted flow rate is not always a straight line, but rather a loop or a curved line. This makes it difficult to visually inspect and select the value of X that produces the best straight line, as different users may interpret the relationship differently. Additionally, the subjective nature of the trial-and-error procedure can lead to different values of X and, consequently, different values of the Muskingum parameters."}, {"question": "How does the Muskingum method account for the time of travel through the reach in the estimation of the outflow hydrograph?", "answer": "The Muskingum method accounts for the time of travel through the reach by using the parameter K, which represents the travel time.

{"paragraph": "7.3.2 From physical characteristics of the channel Diffusive behavior of the Muskingum wave Amongthepropertiesofthelinearkinematicwaveisthefact,explainedinSection5.4.3, that it propagates along the channel with a celerity , but without any change in shape. Therefore,itwaspuzzlingtopractitionersforsometimeinthepastthatthisisapparently notthecasefortheMuskingumwave,eventhoughitisbasedonthesameapproximation as outlined in Section 5.4.4. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 7.10, a Muskingum flood wave undergoes not only translation in time but also a change in shape. It is now realized that the change in shape of the calculated wave is not the result of theunderlyingphysics,butrathertheresultofnumericaldiffusioncausedbytheapprox- imation of derivatives by ratios of finite differences. Any lumped kinematic approach is based on the storage equation (7.11); that equation is a discretized form of the continuity equation, in which the spatial derivative is approximated by a difference over a distance (cid:6)x. As pointed out by Cunge (1969), it is this approximation that causes the spreading of the calculated wave. The diffusion introduced by finite difference approximations can be determined by trying to recover the partial differential equation (5.111), without lateral inflow, from (7.37). Recall that the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the beginning and end of the time (cid:6)t; interval similarly, the subscripts i and e refer to the inflow and exit end of the spatial (cid:6)x. reach For the present purpose, the four terms can be expressed in terms of the rate of flow Q(x, t) by a Taylor expansion as follows (cid:5) (cid:6) ∂x ∂t ∂x2 where the terms of order higher than 2 have been neglected. Substitution of (7.46) − )(cid:6)t] into (7.37) and division by [(1 produces the following partial differential estimation of the muskingum parameters equation 0 (7.47) ∂t2 − ∂x ∂t This result is obtained from Equation (7.37). In principle, (7.37) is merely a finite differ- ence form of the kinematic wave equation (5.111) (in the absence of lateral inflow ). The kinematic wave equation contains only first-order derivatives. Hence, this suggests that the first two terms of (7.47) must represent the corresponding derivative terms in the kinematic wave equation (5.111); it also suggests that the additional three terms in (7.47),whichcontainsecond-orderderivatives,weresomehowintroducedspuriouslyby the finite difference approximation. This can be verified as follows. Upon substitution of (7.38) for the constants, the coefficient of the second term of (7.47) reduces to (cid:6)x since is the length of the reach, and the time of travel of this flood wave, their ratio istheMuskingumcelerityc ,alreadydefinedin(7.20).Thecorrespondingcoefficientin thekinematicwaveequation(5.111)isc .ThismeansthattheMuskingumwavecelerity is in fact the kinematic wave celerity, or The remaining three terms in (7.47) can be combined into one term by means of the followingkinematicwaveidentities(obtainedbytakingderivativesof(5.111)(forQ and making use of (7.48)), ∂x∂t ∂x2 Finally, with some algebra (7.47) becomes 0 (7.50) ∂t ∂x ∂x2 This is the standard advective diffusion equation with an advectivity, given by the kine- matic wave celerity, = (cid:6)x/K and with a diffusivity = − (cid:6)x/2 (1 2X) (7.52) inwhich,asbefore,thesubscript0indicateslinearity.Equation(7.52)illustrateshowthe (cid:6)x discretization is responsible for the diffusion effect inherent in the storage equation. (cid:6)xis In the limit, when made to approach zero to obtain a derivative, the diffusivity streamflow routing disappears; this is not the case for the celerity in (7.51), because the time of travel then also goes to zero. Physically based estimation of the parameters: the MCD method The MCD acronym stands for the Muskingum–Cunge–Dooge method and it refers to the names of the two investigators who contributed independently to its development. AsproposedbyCunge(1969),thenumericaldiffusionintheMuskingumformulation can be put to good use in the estimation of the parameters and K; this is done simply by requiring this numerical diffusion to be equal to the physical diffusion resulting from the hydraulic characteristics of the flow. Accordingly, equating (7.51) and (7.52) with (cid:6)x which for wide channels is equal to 1)V ], and (cid:6)x The symbol is a typical reference flow rate in the channel, the parameter of (5.39) which is normally taken as for turbulent flow (see Table 5.2), is the kinematic (cid:6)x wave celerity, is the channel width, is the bed slope, and is the length of the channel reach. With the more accurate expression (5.98) for the diffusivity, this is (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (7.55) (cid:6)x In cases when the channel is sufficiently wide, the Kleitz–Seddon principle (5.108) can be used to express (7.55) in even simpler terms, namely (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (7.56) + (cid:6)x 2 (a 1)S All these expressions for indicate that it is normally smaller than 0.5. In a different development, Dooge (1973) determined the parameters and of the Muskingumformulationbyequatingitsfirsttwomoments(7.31)and(7.34)withthefirst two moments obtainable from the unit response (5.72); recall that this response function is obtained by the exact solution of the linearized complete shallow water equation (5.67). The details of this derivation are beyond the present scope, but it is easy to show that the resulting expressions are the same as (7.53) and (7.56). This indicates that the application of the Muskingum formulation with (7.53) and (7.56) will ensure that it produces a wave motion whose average speed of propagation and dispersion are the same as those obtainable with the exact solution. It also means that the expressions for the Muskingum parameters in Equations (7.53)–(7.56) are even better than would be suggested by a cursory review of Cunge’s (1969) derivation. These expressions conform not only with the diffusion approximation, but with the exact solution of the linearized complete shallow water equation (5.67), as well. estimation of the muskingum parameters Practical implementation: linear or nonlinear? In the standard application of the Muskingum method the parameters and are usually considered as constants, and treated as characteristics of the channel reach in question. However, the physically based expressions (7.53) and (7.54) show how in reality and (cid:6)x depend on the reference rate of flow , once has been decided upon. As long as the actual flow rates are only small deviations from the reference flow , a linearized algorithmcanbeexpectedtoperformwell.Floodwavesnormallyinvolvelargedeviations, andsincetheMuskingummethodisessentiallylinear,thequestionariseswhatvalueshould be assigned to in Equations (7.53) and (7.54) to ensure optimal results. A few studies have focused on this issue. Actually, the form of (7.53) and (7.54) opens up the possibility of applying the Musk- ingum method in a nonlinear way. Cunge (1969) already suggested that be adjusted to allowextrapolationoftheMuskingumparametersbeyondtherangeofpreviouslyobserved events. Miller and Cunge (1975, p. 226) subsequently treated the parameters as functions responding to the flow rate at that time and adjusting them at every time step of the computation;theyappliedthistechniquetoachannelwithacompoundcrosssection.Inthe same vein, Koussis (1978) proposed an adjustment of at each computational time step, by means of the uniform rating curve to estimate (dQ ) in (7.53); but while can also be easily adjusted as a function of Q, he found from his analysis of wave propagation on the Rhine, that the results tend to be relatively insensitive to the exact value of and thatthereforeaconstantvalueshouldbeadequate.Ontheotherhand,PonceandYevjevich (1978) concluded that the overall difference between a linear and nonlinear application of resultsusinganaveragevalueofQtorepresentQ ,butopinedthattheuseofthepeakvalue of the hydrograph as might be easier to implement in practice. Example 7.4. Application of the MCD method Consider again the inflow and outflow hydrographs of Example 7.2 and illustrated in Figure 7.11.

In Example 7.2 the Muskingum parameters were found to be 1.99 h and 0.30. It is easy to check that Equations (7.53) and (7.54) produce the same values of these parameters with an assumed reference value of the discharge rate of roughly 2000 by means of the Gauckler–Manning equation (5.41) this can be shown to correspond with a water depth 6.14 m and a reference velocity m The hydrograph calculated with these values of and has already been compared in Figure 7.10 with the observed outflow hydrograph. The sensitivity of theMCDmethodtothevalueoftheassumedreferencedischargerateQ canbetestedby carrying out the calculations with two different values, say and 2500 In the case of 1500 in the same river channel (5.41) produces a velocity 1.71 m and a water depth 5.17 m. With these values one obtains with (7.53) and (7.54) the parameter values 2.24 h and 0.34.

{"paragraph": "7.3.3 Adjustment of calibration parameters on physical grounds The expressions for the Muskingum parameters derived in the previous section require a knowledge of the effective channel hydraulic parameters of the channel reach. In this case, “effective” means that the hydraulic parameters should have values, which produce the optimal results with the Muskingum procedure. Therefore, effective parameters may not be easy to ascertain from the available information on the channel characteristics or even from field surveys.

However, the terms soil and aquifer material are often used interchange- ably. Many of these formations consist of alluvial and colluvial deposits, which as ripar- ian aquifers are major contributors to streamflow. Although in some regions underlain by limestone or karst formations, large quantities of water can be transported through solution channels and caves, globally they are of much less importance. Formations consisting of volcanic rock, shale and clay layers, which are porous but which transmit water relatively slowly, are often considered impermeable for hydrologic purposes; as such they are referred to as aquicludes. The voids or open spaces between the particles of soils and other granular materials are referred to as pores. An important property of such water-bearing formations is their porosity. This can be defined as follows (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)∀ volume of voids in lim (8.1) (cid:2)∀ (cid:2)∀→0 where(cid:2)∀isasmallvolumeofporousmaterial.Thisdefinitionissubjecttothecontinuum paradox: on the one hand, the limit is necessary to allow the description of phenomena (cid:2)∀ at a point by means of infinitesimal calculus; on the other hand, the volume must be kept large enough so that represents a meaningful ensemble average over pores of many different sizes. The porosity of a soil depends primarily on its particle size distribution and on its structure. Some of these features are illustrated in Figures 8.1 and 8.2. A soil with a wide distribution of particle sizes tends to have a smaller porosity than a soil consisting of particles or grains of a more uniform size. The structure of a granular porous material refers to the arrangement of the particles among one another and to their aggregation into larger structures. Thus the porosity can be increased by agricultural operations, such as ploughing or raking, or by frost; these processes “open up” the soil simplybyrearrangingtherelativepositionsoftheparticles.Similarly,theporosityofthe soil can be decreased by compaction. In principle, in the case of soils consisting of inert material, their texture, that is the size of the particles, should not affect the porosity, as long as their structure, particle size distributions and chemical composition are similar.

This process can be illustrated by the following thought experiment. A thought experiment Consider, as shown in Figure 8.3, a sample of soil SS to be tested; it is placed on a porous plate PP in a container C, to which a flexible tube FT is connected. (In a real experiment a B¨ uchner filter with fritted disk with sufficiently small pores can be used for this purpose.) The pores of the porous plate PP are much smaller than those of the sample SS (see Figure 8.4). Set up the experiment in such a way that initially the entire system, i.e. soil sample, container and tube, are filled with water, and that the vertical distance between the center of the sample and the outlet of the tube is zero. Assume for this simple experiment that the soil sample is incompressible so that it maintains its original volume throughout, and that the water has a constant density .

This is due to the increased curvature of the water menisci in the smaller pores, which results in a greater suction force required to remove additional water from the soil. The relationship between soil water content and suction is fundamental to understanding soil water dynamics and is a key factor in determining the soil's water-holding capacity and its response to changes in water availability."}, {"question": "How does the specific weight of water influence the expression of soil water pressure?", "answer": "The specific weight of water is used to express the soil water pressure as an equivalent height of water column.

Some of the more important mechanisms can be ranked, according to increasing energy required to remove the water, as follows. (i) As water is removed from a non-shrinking saturated soil, it is replaced by air, and water–air interfaces develop in the pore space; the energy required to form these interfaces, and thus to withdraw the water, is directly related to surface tension. hydrostatics of pore-filling water (ii) Natural soils, especially those with finer texture, consist of particles that are not inert, but active as a result of electrical charges at their surfaces. In the presence of water such surface-active particles interact, repelling each other and attracting in the intervening spaces ions, and thus also more water to relieve the osmotic pressure; this osmotic pressure difference, between the water in the immediate vicinity of the particles and that in the larger pores of the soil, in turn gives rise to hydrostatic pressure differ- ences. This may also be accompanied by swelling during wetting, and shrinking during subsequent drying. (iii) Water molecules also behave as dipoles, and as such they may undergo attraction by the electrical surface charges of the soil particles. (iv) When the soil contains clay particles (especially montmorillonite), water can be held between the “sandwich” layers of these clayey minerals in a quasi-crystalline fashion; actually, the water is held so strongly by this mechanism that it could be debated whether the water should be considered “free” or “chemically bound.” Surface tension Among these mechanisms, those involving surface tension are probably the most impor- tantinthecontextofhydrology.Surfacetensionorcapillarityactsattheinterfacebetween two fluids. In simple terms, one can visualize the molecules in a liquid as being subject to attraction by their neighbors. Far from boundaries the field is symmetrical and these molecular effects are balanced. However, near the interface with another fluid whose molecules are less attracting, the balance is broken and the molecules are pulled more toward their own bulk. In order to increase the interfacial area of the liquid in question, work is necessary. The surface tension is a measure of this work and, thus, of the energy required to maintain that interface. In the case of the interface between water and air, in the range of 0 30 the surface tension can be estimated approximately by 10−3 Jm−2 Nm−1), (75.6 0.14 T) (or with the temperature in C (degrees celsius). The word capillarity is derived from the Latin capilla, or hair, because surface tension is manifested by the phenomenon of the rise of water in hair-thin glass tubes. In the soil profile the zone above the water table, where the water content is near saturation even though the pressure is negative, is often referred to as the (see capillary fringe Figure 8.7). Similarly, whenever the soil water pressure is negative, it is also called pressure. capillary Equation of Laplace As a result of surface tension, any pressure difference across the interface of two immis- cible fluids that are in contact with each other is accompanied by a curvature of their interface. It can readily be shown that this phenomenon is described by (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)p = σ ± (cid:2)p(= − in which ) is the pressure difference across the interface, and and are the two principal radii of curvature of the interface; the plus sign between the two termsinsidethebracketsappliestosynclasticinterfaces,andtheminussigntoanticlastic surfaces.

Special case of a capillary tube In the case of the capillary tube, in which water is in contact with air at atmospheric increase(cid:2)p = − pressure, as illustrated in Figure 8.10, the pressure (p ) in the tran- sition from water to air equals the suction (i.e. negative pressure) in the water ). If the radius of the tube is small enough so that the interface can be assumed to have the R/cosα, α curvature of a sphere, the radii of curvature are both equal to where is the wetting angle of water with the glass. The wetting angle between water and quartz-like materials and other soil minerals is usually (except in the presence of impurities) small; the water pressure according to Equation (8.3) becomes then simply and the capillary rise is H) or roughly at when both and are in cm and the specific weight is constant. Equation (8.5) is valid for the ideal case of a tube of circular cross section with a radius R. Figure 8.4 illustrates how the water can be held in an analogous way in the pores of an irregular array of particles; for such pores of irregular cross section, Equation (8.5) can be used to define an effective radius: this is the radius of a capillary tube of circular cross section, with (cid:2)p = −p the same value of across its water–air interface. Pore size distribution In numerous studies the effective radius of curvature of the air–water interface in a pore, as used in Equation (8.5), has also been taken as a measure of the size of that pore; by analogy with pipes with a circular cross section, is usually taken to be equal to twice the hydraulic radius , as defined in Equation (5.40), that is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the pore to its wetted perimeter. Equation (8.5) indicates that the pressure drop across the air–water interface in any pore is inversely proportional to the size of the pore. This means that with increasing negative pressures or suctions H)increasinglysmallerporesarebeingemptied.Thesoilwatercharacteristic withthewatercontentθ,thatisthewaterstillleftinthesoil.Hence, relatesthesuction if it is assumed that at a given suction all pores above size are empty, the soil water characteristic with (8.5) is equivalent with a cumulative pore size distribution.

To avoid the limitations of the capillary model in the range of lower water contents, where other water retention forces are predominant, in this context it is convenient to use a linear transformation, defining an effective saturation, where is the water content at atmospheric pressure, i.e. at 0; the subscript r refers to the residual water content or residual degree of saturation, which is mainly a normalizing parameter but which may also be visualized as the moisture present in dead end pores or otherwise so strongly held that it is unavailable for flow. The effective = (R)/dR pore size density can be obtained by determining the slope of (R) as a functionof R.Figure8.11illustrateshowsucheffectiveporesizedistributionanddensity functions can be obtained from the soil water characteristic by means of Equations (8.5) and (8.6). This approach to obtain a pore-size distribution probably dates back to the work of Donat (1937), who used his results to characterize the structure and stability of soils. Similar early studies were also undertaken by Schofield (1938), Bradfield and Jamison (1946).

As shown in Figure 8.4, the water–air interfaces, or menisci, tend to occur at the narrower openings or “necks” of the pores. It is thus incorrect to assume that at a given suction all pores with effective sizes larger than that given by Equation (8.5) are filled with air.

These mechanisms can be ranked according to increasing energy required to remove the water. Surface tension is related to the energy required to form water-air interfaces in the pore space as water is removed from a saturated soil. Hydrostatics of pore-filling water involves the interaction of surface-active particles and the resulting osmotic pressure differences. The attraction by electrical surface charges of soil particles and the holding of water between clay particles in a quasi-crystalline fashion require higher energies."}, {"question": "How does surface tension act at the interface between two fluids, and what is its significance in hydrology?", "answer": "Surface tension acts at the interface between two fluids, such as water and air, due to the attraction between molecules in the liquid. This attraction creates a force that acts along the interface, causing it to behave as if it has an \"elastic skin\" at the surface. The significance of surface tension in hydrology lies in its role in capillarity, which is the ability of a liquid to flow through a narrow space, such as a soil pore, without the need for pressure. Surface tension is a key factor in determining the water retention characteristics of soils and is essential for understanding many hydrological processes, including infiltration, percolation, and groundwater flow."}, {"question": "In the context of capillary rise in a soil, why does the water pressure according to the Laplace equation become simply p = −2σ cosα / R, and what implications does this have for understanding water movement in soils?", "answer": "The water pressure according to the Laplace equation becomes p = −2σ cosα / R because the radii of curvature of the water-air interface in a capillary tube are both equal to R/cosα, where α is the wetting angle of water with the soil material. This equation implies that the capillary rise is inversely proportional to the radius of the tube and directly proportional to the surface tension and the cosine of the wetting angle. Understanding this relationship is crucial for predicting water movement in soils, as it helps hydrologists estimate the height to which water will rise in the soil profile and the pressure at which water will be held in the soil pores."}, {"question": "What is the concept of effective pore size density, and how is it related to the soil water characteristic?", "answer": "The effective pore size density is a measure of the distribution of pore sizes in a soil, which can be obtained from the soil water characteristic by means of the Laplace equation. The soil water characteristic relates the water content to the suction or negative pressure in the soil. By transforming the suction into an equivalent pore radius using the Laplace equation, the effective pore size density can be determined. This concept is useful for understanding the water retention properties of soils and for estimating permeability, as it provides a way to characterize the pore size distribution of a soil."}, {"question": "In the context of hysteresis in capillary tubes, how do the water levels change when the tubes are initially filled with water versus when they are initially empty, and what does this imply about the behavior of water in soils?", "answer": "When capillary tubes are initially filled with water and then inserted into a water bath, the water levels fall to a certain position. In contrast, when the tubes are initially empty and then inserted into the water bath, the water levels rise to a different position. This hysteresis behavior implies that the water content in a soil can differ depending on whether the soil is being wetted or dried, even if the suction or negative pressure is the same. This has significant implications for understanding water movement and storage in soils, as it suggests that the soil water characteristic is not a unique function of the suction, but rather depends on the history of wetting and drying."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of a pore size distribution obtained from the soil water characteristic using the Laplace equation considered to have shortcomings, and what are the limitations of this approach?", "answer": "The concept of a pore size distribution obtained from the soil water characteristic using the Laplace equation is considered to have shortcomings because it assumes that at a given suction, all pores with effective sizes larger than that given by the equation are filled with air. However, in reality, the water-air interfaces or menisci tend to occur at the narrower openings or \"necks\" of the pores, making this assumption incorrect. Additionally, this approach does not account for other water retention forces that may be predominant at lower water contents, such as osmotic pressure differences and attraction by electrical surface charges.

Figure 8.12 shows that the water–air interface can be found at different levels in capillary tubes with expansions, depending on the manner, in which these tubes have been filled.

The bounding curves of the hysteresis regions shown in these figures are called curves; any point wetting and drying boundary inside the hysteresis region can be reached by scanning curves; the scanning curves starting from the drying and wetting boundary curves can be called primary wetting and curves, respectively. It is obvious by now that there is an infinity of drying scanning possible scanning curves in the hysteresis region. To describe these quantitatively, some type of interpolation scheme must be devised. hydrostatics of pore-filling water Fig.8.15 Typicaldryingand wettingboundary curvesofthesoil watercharacteristic.

However, one of the first attempts to treat capillary hysteresis in soils quantitatively was published by Poulovassilis (1962), who made use of the concept of The effect of entrapped air One obvious manifestation of hysteresis is often observed in experiments involving suc- cessiveandrepeateddryingandwettingcycles.Asanillustration,considerthefollowing sequence illustrated in Figure 8.15. Assume that initially the soil is fully saturated and θ = θ θ = that its water content is ; thus all its pores are filled with water so that which is the true porosity as defined in Equation (8.1). Consider that, next, the soil is drained down to by imposing a negative water pressure, and that it is then subsequently rewetted by bringing the pressure back to zero. At this point the water content will invariably not be , but somewhat smaller, say . This difference can be attributed largely to the presence of entrapped air in dead-end pores, from which it cannot escape during the rewetting cycle. Usually, all subsequent drying and wetting cycles will continue to take place between and , and normally it will be impossible to recover the original water content at . In carefully controlled experimental set-ups in the laboratory the full saturation can only be achieved by taking special precautions, such as the use of deaerated water or the passage of CO through the soil prior to the application of the water, or prolonged soaking or immersion. The water content is oftenreferredtoassatiation,todistinguishitfromthefullsaturation,θ .Thetwoterms are often used interchangeably. However, in field situations involving normal wetting and drying processes, the water content at 0 is usually satiation. water beneath the ground Fig.8.16 Exampleofthe independent function The independent domain approach In brief, this concept involves the assumption that each element (or pore) of the total pore space is specified completely by the (negative) pressure range over which it is emptied, and that over which it is filled. Implicit in this is that any such element is either full or empty, with a transition sometimes referred to as a Haines jump. With this assumption, one can define a function F(H ), which represents the fraction of the pore space, which drains at a negative pressure or suction and wets or is filled at a suction . This function can be represented graphically by the isometric projection shown in Figure 8.16. All pores require either the same or a larger suction to be emptied than that required to fill them, so that . The symbol denotes the maximal tension to be experienced in the soil water. The function can now be related to the soil water characteristic as follows. AsillustratedinFigure8.15,thefluidvolumethatentersthesoilduringwettingbetween and amounts to On the other hand, as shown in Figure 8.16, in terms of this volume equals δθ = F(x, δH )dx (8.7) in which is the dummy variable of integration.

The primary wetting scanning curve BA shows how the water content which drained between 0 and is redistributed during rewetting; similarly, the primary wetting scanning curve CA shows how the water content that drained between 0 and is redistributed during rewetting. Hence, subtraction of the amount of water entering the pore space as described by curve BA from the amount entering, as described by curve CA, shows how the amount redistributes itself during rewetting.

For this reason several attempts have been made to simplify the independent domain model withvarioussimilarityassumptionsby,amongothers,Parlange(1976),MualemandMiller (1979), and Braddock al. (2001). In what follows a brief description is presented of Parlange’s (1976) proposal, which has been useful in many practical applications. Themainassumptionisthat isindependentof ,sothat F(H , )canbereplaced by F(H ). This means that, for example in Table 8.1, the values in each column can be replaced by their averages. In Table 8.1, the values in the column between values 20 and 24 cm, all become equal to 4.05%. It also means that, for example in Figure 8.18, DE would be represented by a straight line. The main advantage of this simplification is that it becomes possible to calculate all the scanning curves from the boundary drying curve, which is also the easiest to determine experimentally. For instance, the function F(H ) can be determined immediately by integration of Equation (8.9) as water beneath the ground 0 10 20 30 H ) (cm) Fig.8.19 Soilwatercharacteristiccurvesinasequenceofwettinganddryingpathsfollowingthesame sequenceasintheexampleshowninFigure8.17.Thesolidcurveswereobtainedusingthe experimental functionofTable8.1,andthedashedcurveswereobtainedbyapplyingthe similarityassumptiontothesamedata.

Numerical calculation The numerical procedure can be illustrated by using the same sequence as shown in Figure 8.17. Assume for the present example 20cm, 8cm, 16cm, and 4 cm. The calculations can be readily carried out by summing and subtracting the values in Table 8.1, as indicated in Figure 8.17. The results for the regular independent domain procedure using the values of Table 8.1 and those for Parlange’s (1976) simplified procedure using averaged columns in Table 8.1 can be compared in Figure 8.19. While the determination of hysteresis curves is difficult enough with data obtained in the laboratory, it is even more so with field data (see Royer and Vachaud, 1975; Watson etal.,1975).Therefore,althoughtheindependentdomainapproachanditssimplerversions may perhaps be considered crude approximations, they should be quite useful in practical simulations of soil water flow problems.

This means that the relationship is not single-valued and depends on whether the soil is undergoing a drying or wetting process. As a result, hysteresis affects the shape of the soil water characteristic curves, making them different for sustained drying or wetting events, and even more complex for situations involving alternate wetting and drying."}, {"question": "Why does the independent domain approach require the assumption that each element of the total pore space is specified completely by the pressure range over which it is emptied and filled?", "answer": "The independent domain approach requires this assumption because it allows for the definition of a function F(H), which represents the fraction of the pore space that drains at a negative pressure or suction and wets or is filled at a suction. This assumption simplifies the complex interactions between pores and enables the calculation of scanning curves from the boundary drying curve, which is the easiest to determine experimentally.

When a soil is drained and then rewetted, the water content does not return to its initial value due to the entrapped air, which cannot escape during the rewetting cycle. This results in a smaller water content, and subsequent cycles will continue to take place between this reduced water content and the satiation value, rather than the initial full saturation."}, {"question": "In the context of the independent domain model, what is the significance of the function F(H), and how can it be simplified for practical applications?", "answer": "The function F(H) represents the fraction of the pore space that drains at a negative pressure or suction and wets or is filled at a suction. To simplify the model for practical applications, Parlange's (1976) proposal assumes that F(H) is independent of the pressure range over which a pore is filled, allowing the replacement of F(H, H) with F(H). This simplification enables the calculation of all scanning curves from the boundary drying curve, which is the easiest to determine experimentally, making the model more practical for simulations of soil water flow problems."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to determine hysteresis curves, especially with field data, and what implications does this have for soil water flow simulations?", "answer": "Determining hysteresis curves is challenging due to the complexity of the interactions between pores and the difficulty in obtaining accurate experimental data, particularly with field data. This challenge implies that soil water flow simulations may be subject to significant errors if hysteresis is ignored or not accurately represented. However, using approximations like the independent domain approach, despite their potential crudeness, can still provide useful results, as the error from these approximations is likely to be smaller than the errors from ignoring hysteresis or uncertainties in soil water flow parameters."}, {"question": "How does the independent domain approach facilitate the calculation of scanning curves during wetting and drying processes, and what are the implications for understanding soil water behavior?", "answer": "The independent domain approach facilitates the calculation of scanning curves by defining a function F(H) that represents the fraction of the pore space that drains or wets at specific suctions. This allows for the integration of the function to yield different primary and secondary scanning curves during wetting and drying. The implications of this approach are significant, as it enables a better understanding of soil water behavior, including the effects of hysteresis on soil water characteristic curves and the redistribution of water content during successive wetting and drying cycles."}, {"question": "In the context of soil water flow, what are the limitations of the independent domain model, and how can they be addressed in practical applications?", "answer": "The limitations of the independent domain model include the assumption that each pore is either full or empty and the difficulty in obtaining accurate experimental data to estimate the function F(H). These limitations can be addressed by using simplifications like Parlange's (1976) proposal, which assumes F(H) is independent of the pressure range over which a pore is filled. Additionally, the model can be improved by incorporating more complex pore interactions and using advanced experimental techniques to obtain more accurate data."}]}

{"paragraph": "8.3.1 Dynamics of pore-filling fluids: the law of Darcy The original experiments In a report on the public fountains and water supply for the City of Dijon in Burgundy, Darcy (1856) presented the results of his experiments on the seepage of water through a pipe filled with sand, with a 0.35 m inside diameter and a 3.00 m effective length (see Figure8.21).Inbrief,hefoundthattherateofflow throughthesandlayerwasdirectly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the sand column and to the difference of (cid:2)L hydraulic head across the layer, and inversely proportional to the length of the sand column. In this notation his result can be formulated as (h (8.17) in which the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the entrance and the exit section of the column, respectively. The symbol represents a constant of proportionality, which is now com- monly referred to as the conductivity, and which has the dimensions [L hydraulic In the experiments of Darcy the water had essentially a constant specific weight and the hydraulic head can be defined as usual, namely where is the vertical coordinate. When the negative pressure is expressed as equivalent water column, Equation (8.18) can also be written concisely as H. Anyinstrumentusedtomeasurethehydraulicconductivityk,thatissimilartotheset- up originally used by Darcy, is often referred to as a permeameter. Over the years many different designs have been developed, but they are all nearly the same in principle, in that they provide the measurements of and (h ) needed to invert Equation (8.17) in order to estimate k. Some types of permeameters are also available commercially. Formulation at a point Undertheassumptionthattheporousmaterialcanbetreatedasacontinuum,both and (cid:2)L can be allowed to become infinitesimally small, so that Equation (8.17) describes the flow at a point and can be written concisely in common vector notation as where is the specific volumetric flux, that is the volumetric rate of q q i q j q k flow per unit area of porous material, the gradient water transport in a porous material Fig.8.21 Drawingof theoriginal experimental set-upas presentedby Darcy(1856). operator. With subscripts representing the vector components, this is also often written where represents x, and for 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For a fluid of density at a pressure in an infinitesimal control volume, the forces that drive the flow are (per ∇p (ρgk), unit volume) the pressure gradient and gravity if is the vertical coordinate so that is the unit vector in the vertical direction. Therefore, whenever the fluid density water beneath the ground varies over the flow region, the hydraulic head cannot be given by Equation (8.18), but it must be defined in gradient form as follows, ∇h = + ∇p In the same notation as Equation (8.20) this gradient can be written as ∂h ∂x ∂p ∂x ∂x ρg ∂x in which is specified as the vertical coordinate. The (intrinsic) permeability It stands to reason that the ease or difficulty with which a fluid flows through a porous medium depends on the sizes and the arrangement of the pores and also on the prop- erties of the fluid. Therefore the hydraulic conductivity must be affected by both fac- tors. Whenever it is desirable to separate the effects of the fluid from those of the porous matrix, use can be made of the permeability, also called intrinsic permeability, with dimensions This is defined as (cid:7)γ (cid:7) whereγ = ρg isthespecificweight,ρ thedensity,μthedynamicviscosityandν = μ/ρ thekinematicviscosityofthefluidinquestion,respectively.Onewaytoarriveattheform ofEquation(8.23)isbysimpledimensionalanalysis;thusoneobservesthattheeasewith which the fluid moves through the porous material, that is the hydraulic conductivity [L T is in fact the ratio it is then reasonable to assume that this ratio should be affected by the following three variables: the area available for the flow in the pores,ascharacterizedbysomeeffectiveoraverageporeradius ,[L],andthetwofluid propertiesthatgovernthedynamicsoflowReynoldsnumber(orcreeping)flows,namely theviscosityμ,[M onlywaytocombinethesethreevariablestoobtainthesamedimensionsasthehydraulic conductivity is as (Ge in which Ge is a dimensionless constant introduced to represent the geometrical shape of the pores; hence, on dimensional grounds Darcy’s equation assumes the form The main point of (8.24) is that it shows first, how the fluid property effects on the flow can be separated from those of the porous matrix; and second, how the porous matrix itself affects the flow, not only by the sizes of the pores in terms of , but also by their geometrical shape in terms of Ge. The sizes of the pores depend mainly on the sizes and the distribution of the sizes of the solid particles of the porous material. The geometricalshapesofthepores,inturn,dependlargelyonthearrangementofthesesame particles. This explains how the hydraulic conductivity of soils can be greatly reduced by compaction, as carried out for road or dam construction purposes, or also greatly water transport in a porous material increased by ploughing, harrowing and other agricultural operations. But the concept has its limitations, and should be used with caution, especially in the case of clayey soils. Depending on the type of clay, the pore structure of some soils may be sensitive to the type of electrolytes or salts that are in solution in the water; for instance, sodium is notorious in this regard. This means that it is not always possible to separate the effects of the fluid on the hydraulic conductivity completely from those of the porous matrix. It is of interest to observe that in the form of Equation (8.24), Darcy’s law can be consideredasageneralizationofseveralwell-knowncreepingflowequations,obtainable for certain flow regions with a regular geometry, to the case of a totally irregular pore geometry resulting from the random assemblage of the particles of soils and other gran- ular materials. For instance, in the case of flow through a straight pipe of circular cross section, creeping flow is described by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation; this is equivalent with (8.24) if is taken to represent the average velocity in the pipe, is the radius of parallel plates (as used in the Hele–Shaw model) by putting Ge and as half the spacing of the plates, again if is made to represent the average velocity. Similarly, Equation (8.24) can be used to describe the average velocity of flow down a plane as in (5.32), provided Ge is taken as the depth of flow and the hydraulic gradient is the slope of the plane . All three expressions just mentioned are exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations (1.12) for creeping flow, and can be found in elementary textbooksinfluidmechanics.(RecallthatcreepingflowisflowwithaverylowReynolds (Dv/Dt)becomes number so that negligible.) In the literature there have been numerous attempts to derive Darcy’s law from the Navier–Stokes equations, mostly by analogy with these exact solutions. On account of the irregular geometry of the pores resulting fromrandompackingsofparticles,toarriveatthedesiredresultanysuchderivationmust involve some kind of ensemble averaging and other stochastic assumptions, which may not always be valid. But regardless of such considerations, pragmatically it is probably preferable to adopt Darcy’s law simply as it is, that is as an experimentally obtained and verified relationship, in which or is best obtained from measurements. True velocity As defined in Darcy’s equation, or is the volumetric rate of flow per unit bulk area of porous material. Thus even though it has the basic dimensions of [L it does not represent the average velocity of the fluid particles. The “true” average velocity inside the pores is usually assumed to be given by (q ) under fully saturated conditions, and by (q under partly saturated conditions. Anistropy (cid:7)) same direction and (or is a scalar quantity, that is independent of direction. Porous materials in which this holds true are referred to as isotropic.

In an anisotropic material the two vectors and do not necessarily point in the same direction. It can be shown that the only way to formulate a linear relationship between such vectors is by means of a second-order tensor or a dyad. Thus Darcy’s law for anisotropic material must be of the form ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k x xx xy xz ∂x ∂y ∂z ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k y yx yy yz ∂x ∂y ∂z ∂h ∂h ∂h = −k −k −k z zx zy zz ∂x ∂y ∂z Alternatively, this can be written more concisely in the subscript notation as (cid:12) has nine components.

Example 8.4. Directions of the gradient and of the flux vector To bring out some of the implications of anisotropy, consider the flux vector and the negative hydraulic gradient vector which drives it, in a principal axes system, as shown in Figure 8.22. The gradient consists of two components, and can therefore be broken down as follows ∇h = i+ = Similarly, the specific flux can be written as |q|(cosβi+sinβk) also be written as water transport in a porous material Fig.8.22 Definitionsketchofthedirectionsofthespecificfluxand gradientvectorsinananisotropicmaterial,inwhich kxx kzz,and x z and areprincipalaxes. respectively, one obtains tanβ = tanα This shows that the directions of the specific flux and of the (negative) hydraulic gradient canbethesameonlywhentheporousmediumisisotropic.Inananisotropicmaterialthese two vectors point in different directions. Scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity It has been noted in numerous applications of Darcy’s law to field conditions, that the values of k, required to reproduce the observed flow rates, tend to depend on the size of the domain over which Equation (8.19) is integrated or averaged. In other words, the magnitude of is scale dependent. Thus values of the hydraulic conductivity for a given soil are often larger when obtained from auger hole measurements in the field, than from small column measurements in the manner of Darcy (see Figure 8.21) or in other types of permeameters. Values of obtained by inversion methods with data from small river catchments (see Brutsaert and Lopez, 1998) tend to be still larger. Permeameters involve a flow domain with typical length scales of the order of 1.0 m at most, while auger hole measurements and pumping tests tend to have zones of influence with length scales of theorderof10–102 m,respectively;smallcatchmentsusuallyinvolvescalesoftheorder of m or more. There are several possible reasons for this scale dependence. One is that most per- meameter measurements are carried out on disturbed samples; thus the soil is scooped up and placed in the permeameter in a way that usually does not replicate the origi- nal soil structure in the field. Moreover, under natural conditions in the field, most soils havemacroporesandotheradditionalconduitsresultingfromdecayingplantroots,from worms and from burrowing animals; even if undisturbed samples are used, it is nearly impossible to include such macropores and other larger channels within the relatively small confines of a permeameter. Finally, even within a supposedly homogeneous soil type,allsoilpropertiesdisplaypronouncedspatialvariability.Atfieldscalesoftheorder of m, the hydraulic conductivity is usually close to lognormally distributed (see the larger values in the domain have a relatively larger effect on the overall flow than the smaller values. But regardless of the distribution, in a two- and three-dimensional flow situation, regions of smaller conductivity can be bypassed by the flow, resulting water beneath the ground Experimentalvaluesofrelativepermeabilityk(cid:2)/k(cid:2) Fig.8.23 (orrelativeconductivity)ofwater(wettingfluid– asandysoilandinasiltyclayloam.ThecurvesforwaterrepresentEquations (8.36)with(8.45)and thoseforairrepresenttheanalogousexpressionforanon-wettingfluid.(AfterBrooksandCorey, in a larger effective conductivity for the entire flow domain, than a simple average value would suggest (see El-Kadi and Brutsaert, 1985).

{"paragraph": "8.3.2 Partly saturated flow Extension of Darcy’s law It was probably Buckingham (1907) who first postulated that Darcy’s law (8.19) is also valid for a soil that is only partly saturated with water, and that in this case the hydraulic conductivity is a function of water content, or As the water content of the soil is reduced, decreases. Reasons for this are that fewer pores are available for flow, and that the flow paths become more tortuous and thus longer, as the water can no longer move through emptied pores and must move around them. Because the larger pores are emptied first, the initial decrease in conductivity for a certain decrease in water content is larger than that later on at lower water contents.

{"paragraph": "8.3.3 Limitations of Darcy’s law Upper limit In light of the analogy between Darcy’s law and other creeping flow equations of fluid mechanics, it should not be surprising that experiments have shown that, as the Reynolds number increases beyond a certain limit, the specific flux gradually deviates from its linear proportionality with the hydraulic gradient Indeed, by definition, creeping flow is flow for which the appropriate Reynolds number is sufficiently small, so that the accel- eration terms, both temporal and advective, in the Navier–Stokes equations are negligible. Any Reynolds number definition requires the adoption of a characteristic velocity and permeabilityk(cid:7) of a characteristic length of the flow geometry. The definition of the in Equation (8.23) indicates that it has the basic dimensions of and that it can be con- sidered proportional to a characteristic or typical cross-sectional area of flow; thus, since the specific flux has the basic dimensions [L it is convenient to define the Reynolds number for flow in a porous medium as follows k(cid:7) Re (8.33) water beneath the ground Fig.8.28 Convergingsectionofaductillustratinginertiaeffectin aporewithvariablecrosssectionandwiththeresulting convectiveacceleration∂V/∂x; and arethemean inflowandoutflowvelocity,respectively.Athigher velocitiesthiseffectbecomesmorepronounced;theflow ceasestobecreepingandDarcy’sequationisnolonger The Reynolds number is a measure of the relative magnitude of the inertial forces over the viscousforces;thismeansthatDarcy’slawcannotbeexpectedtobevalidforvaluesofRe that are much in excess of order one. It should be emphasized that this initial deviation from Darcy’s law is not caused by the onset of turbulence, but solely by the effects of fluid accelerations. These accelerations result from the irregular and tortuous flow paths in the pores, as illustrated in Figure 8.28. Forchheimer(1930,p.54)wasamongthefirsttoanalyzeexperimentaldataandin1901 he proposed the following to describe them where and are constants for any given soil. Some insight can be gained in the nature of these constants by dimensional inspection of the Navier–Stokes equation (1.12).

Equation (8.35) has been confirmed in numerous experimental investigations. For instance, Arbhabhirama and Dinoy (1973) have reported values of ranging between approximately 0.6 (sand) and 0.2 (angular gravel). Lower limit Several experiments with clayey soils have shown that Darcy’s law also fails to describe the measurements when the flow rates become very small (see Miller and Low, 1963; Swartzendruber, 1968). These experiments indicate that under conditions of low flow rates aresmallerthan−k∇h (orsmallh-gradients),themeasuredspecificfluxesq wouldrequire. The issue has been somewhat controversial (Olsen, 1966) and is still far from resolved (Neuzil,1986).Nevertheless,thisphenomenonmaypossiblyresultfromthefactthatinthe neighborhoodofclayparticles,whichinvariablyhaveelectricalcharges,thewatermolecules may become oriented in a quasi-regular fashion, on account of their dipole characteristics; water transport in a porous material as a result the viscosity of the water may no longer be Newtonian, a necessary condition for the validity of the Navier–Stokes equations and Darcy’s law. Also, in many situations additionaldrivingmechanismsmaybeatplay,besidethehydraulicgradient∇h;thesemay cause flow even when 0. Additional driving forces For most purposes in hydrology it can be assumed that the driving forces are primarily mechanical in nature, which means that the flow is driven by gravity and by a pressure gradient in accordance with Darcy’s law. However, in general, water transport in a porous medium can be influenced by several other factors, involving thermal, osmotic and some- times even electrical effects. For instance, changes in temperature at some point in a partly saturated soil may result in changes in surface tension which affect the pressure given water content, and thus the liquid transport. An input of heat can be accompanied by local vaporization, which in turn sets up a specific humidity gradient, and thus a water vapor transport in the air filled pore space; this vapor may then condense further down and affect the liquid water flux. Onaccountofthecomplexityofthevariousphenomenaandtheirinteractionwithinthe soil, at present there is apparently no theory available, which is generally accepted. Nev- ertheless, in recent years many problems, involving simultaneous heat and water transport, have been studied within a framework developed by Philip and DeVries (1957; DeVries, and practical compatibility of the formulation of Philip and DeVries with concepts of irre- versible thermodynamics; more recently, Cahill and Parlange (1998) have clarified the role of the vapor transport.

The deviation is not caused by the onset of turbulence but solely by the effects of fluid accelerations resulting from irregular and tortuous flow paths in the pores."}, {"question": "Why does Darcy's law fail to describe measurements when the flow rates become very small, especially in clayey soils?", "answer": "Darcy's law fails to describe measurements at very small flow rates in clayey soils because the water molecules may become oriented in a quasi-regular fashion near clay particles due to their dipole characteristics, potentially making the viscosity of the water non-Newtonian. This phenomenon, combined with possible additional driving mechanisms beyond the hydraulic gradient, can cause flow even when the hydraulic gradient is zero.

The equation suggests that the relationship is not linear, especially at higher velocities, and that constants such as α and β, which depend on the soil properties, play a crucial role in determining the specific flux. This equation has been supported by experimental investigations, offering insights into the nature of flow in porous media beyond the range where Darcy's law is applicable."}, {"question": "How do electrical charges on clay particles potentially affect the validity of Darcy's law at low flow rates?", "answer": "Electrical charges on clay particles can cause water molecules to become oriented in a quasi-regular fashion, potentially making the viscosity of the water non-Newtonian. This orientation, due to the dipole characteristics of water molecules, can lead to a deviation from the assumptions underlying Darcy's law, particularly the requirement for Newtonian viscosity. As a result, Darcy's law may not accurately describe the flow at low rates in clayey soils where such electrical interactions are significant."}, {"question": "In what scenarios might additional driving forces beyond the hydraulic gradient influence water transport in porous media?", "answer": "Additional driving forces such as thermal, osmotic, and sometimes electrical effects can influence water transport in porous media, especially in scenarios involving changes in temperature, salinity, or electrical potential. These forces can cause flow even when the hydraulic gradient is zero, complicating the prediction of water movement based solely on Darcy's law.

Factors such as thermal effects, osmotic and electrical potentials, and the non-Newtonian behavior of water in certain conditions contribute to this complexity. While frameworks like that of Philip and DeVries have been developed to address some of these complexities, particularly in relation to heat and water transport, a comprehensive theory that accounts for all relevant factors and is applicable across different conditions remains elusive."}, {"question": "How does the concept of creeping flow relate to the validity of Darcy's law, and what are the implications of exceeding the creeping flow regime?", "answer": "Creeping flow refers to flow for which the appropriate Reynolds number is sufficiently small, making the acceleration terms in the Navier-Stokes equations negligible.

{"paragraph": "8.3.4 Expressions for the conductivity and the soil water diffusivity functions Conductivity of saturated materials In the past, numerous equations have been proposed to predict the hydraulic conductivity of porous materials, mostly on the basis of measurements of the particle sizes or their dis- tribution or also of the pore size distribution, as obtained from Equation (8.5). However, such equations were usually obtained from permeameter measurements of and are there- fore valid only at the local scale. As noted earlier, tends to be scale dependent, so that these methods cannot be used when the hydraulic conductivity is to be used at the field or catchment scale, as is often the case in hydrology.

This has led to the use of relatively simple parametric equations to represent hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content, such as the power form equation.

{"paragraph": "8.3.5 Some models for permeability The experimental determination of the hydraulic conductivity is never easy for saturated soils, but it is especially difficult for unsaturated soils as a function of soil water content. Forthisreason,manyattemptshavebeenmadetodevelopsimpleconceptualizationsofthe flow process and to represent by simple parametric equations, in terms of other properties of the soil that are easier to determine. Uniform pore size models In one common approach the porous medium is assumed to be analogous to a bundle of uniform and parallel capillary tubes with circular cross section. Around 1950, Averyanov (Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952) analyzed the flow of an annulus of wetting fluid in a single tube, the central part of which was occupied by stagnant air. The solution of this flow problem yielded an equation that could be approximated closely by (8.36) with a power =3.5.Bymakingtheslightlydifferentassumptionthatthenon-wettingfluidatthecenter of the tube moves under the same pressure gradient as the wetting fluid along the wall, Yuster (1951) obtained Equation (8.36) with 2. In a different approach, use is made water transport in a porous material of the hydraulic radius concept; it was proposed originally by Kozeny (1927) for saturated materials and can be defined as the ratio of pore volume to particle area. Irmay (1954) extended this to unsaturated porous media and derived (8.36) withn 3. Parallel models In this approach the pore system is assumed to be equivalent with a bundle of uniform capillary tubes of many different sizes. The distribution of the pore sizes is derived from explained after Equation (8.6). The true mean velocity in each pore can be described by a Hagen–Poiseuilletypeequationforcreepingflow,namely(8.24)withavalueofGearound Because (R) represents the pore size density, )(dS )s istheportionoftheporevolumeoccupiedby 0 r e 0 r e “active”pores,withradiusbetween(R denotesavery small increment of R.

Purcell (1949) and Gates and Tempelaar-Lietz (1950) were among the first to apply this approach, and came up with expressions similar to Equation (8.43). However, because (8.43) tended to yield values considerably larger than available experimental data, several subsequentauthorsincludedatortuosityfactorintheformulationtoaccountforthelimita- tions inherent in this model of straight parallel tubes. The tortuosity concept had originally been introduced by Carman (1937; 1956) as an improvement on the uniform hydraulic = /L)2,inwhichL radiusmodelofKozeny(1927),anditcanbeexpressedas (L isthe actual or microscopic path length of the fluid particles in the pores, and is their apparent or macroscopic path length along the Darcy streamlines. In several studies this tortuosity was assumed to depend on the water content, i.e.S ; in this case the relative permeability k(cid:7)/k(cid:7) κ = (= k/k ) can be written as (cid:7) (cid:7) ⎣β ⎦ ⎣β ⎦ β = β(S β = 1.0. where the variable ) is related to the tortuosity and is its value at Burdine (1953) proposed on the basis of his experimental data that water beneath the ground Example 8.5. Calculation with the power function A well-known application of the parallel model is the result of Brooks and Corey (1966), who adopted Burdine’s assumption in (8.44) and integrated it with (8.14) for the soil water characteristic, to derive Equation (8.36) with the value of the exponent Observe that without Burdine’s assumption for tortuosity the parallel model would have yieldedn with experimental measurements for two soils in Figure 8.23. For the Poudre sand the = = 3.4; wetting fluid curve was calculated with the parameters 0125 and for the = 0.250 = 2.3. Amarillo silty clay loam the values used were and Series-parallel models The theoretical construction of these types of model also starts with a bundle of parallel pores,eachwithadifferentbutuniformsize.However,theseporesarethencutnormallyto thedirectionofflowwithtworesultingfaces,andfinallyaftersomerandomrearrangement of the tubes the faces are joined again. This way account is taken of the random variations of the pore sizes, not only in the plane normal to the direction of flow, but also along the direction of flow. In the original version of this model the discharge rate in each single pore, which consists of two sections in series, is assumed to be governed by the section with the smaller diameter. Again, the distribution of the pore sizes is derived from the true velocity in each pore is obtained by means of a Hagen–Poiseuille like equation, as shown in (8.24). This approach was pioneered by Childs and Collis-George (1950) in a finite-difference scheme to calculate the permeability from experimental data. The model was subsequently reformulated in integral form by Brutsaert (1968a), to allow the derivation of more concise analytical expressions for k; this formulation is presented Oneoftheimplicitbutbasicassumptionsoftheoriginalapproachisthatthesizesofthe poresinflowsequencearecompletelyindependentofeachother.Asnoted,thisisvisualized in the construction of the model, by considering that the porous medium is equivalent with anarrayofparalleltubesorflowchannelsofdifferentsizes,whichisfirstcutintotwoparts byaplanesectionnormaltothedirectionofflow;thissectionproducestwosurfaces,which are subsequently joined together again after some random rearrangement of the tubes. It was shown earlier that )s is the area, per unit bulk cross-sectional area of porous material, which is occupied by openings whose sizes are between (R and (R this is also equal to the probability of a point in any cross section through the mediumbeingfoundinaporewiththatsize.Therefore,thefractionoftheareaofthissection occupiedbythesequenceofflowporeswithsizebetween (y first surface with pores with size between (z and (z of the second surface is equal to [θ (1− (z)δyδz If it is assumed that the flow between two pores in sequence is controlled by the smaller of the two, say with size y, then the rate of flow that takes place through a fraction of the −δy/2)and cross-sectionalarea,occupied bythe sequencesof pores withsize between (y water transport in a porous material (y that are in contact with the pores with size between (z and (z − [θ (1− y2δyδz (y)s (z) in which the subscript n indicates the direction normal to the section. The pores with a size between (y and (y of the first surface are in contact with pores of all possible sizes of the second surface. The discharge rate through these pores is (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:7) (cid:7) 0 r e e e e where is the size of the largest pores that are still available for flow at the given degree of saturation. The first term gives the flow rate from the pores of the first surface with size between(y than y; the second term gives the flow rate into the pores of the second surface that are larger than y. Integration over yields finally the total discharge per unit cross-sectional area of porous medium. Hence the intrinsic permeability, defined in Equation (8.23), can be written as k(cid:7) = [θ (1− + )]2 z2dzdy (y)y2 S s s s s dzdy 0 r e e e e where and are dummy variables representing R.

One can show by integration by parts that the first double integral on the right is identical with the second; thus (8.47) can be expressed in a more condensed form as k(cid:7) (2 (S (8.48) Equations (8.47) and (8.48) can now be applied immediately with suitable expressions = ∞and = media to obtain by putting 1.0, respectively, they have been applied k(cid:7)/k(cid:7) mostly to obtain the relative permeability . Example 8.6. Calculation with the power function As before, the integration is especially simple with Equation (8.14) and it produces k(cid:7) S2+2/b +1)(b +2) water beneath the ground For the relative permeability this results again in (8.36) with the value of the exponent The original version of the series-parallel model, both in its finite difference forms and Jackson al., 1965). Although there is a wide variation for different soils, it appears to produce reasonable results for unstructured soils (without macropores). However, it also tends to overestimate the relative permeability somewhat under drier conditions. Several shortcomings of the model are obvious from the assumptions invoked in its derivation. These are that: (i) the sizes of pores in sequence are independent of each other; (ii)theflowrateinaporesequenceiscontrolledbythesmallestdiameter;and(iii)thepores in sequence are lined up perfectly, and they are straight without tortuosity. Assumptions be seen by considering that in the parallel models the sizes of the pores in sequence are assumedtobetotallydependentoneachother,sinceeachflowchannelisassumedtohavea uniform cross section over its whole length; parallel models, without tortuosity correction, severelyoverestimatethepermeabilty.Thustheassumptionofanypartialcorrelationwould result in a further overestimate. Similarly, as regards (ii), inclusion of the larger pore size in the sequence into the expression for the fluid velocity would also result in a larger rate of flow. This means that the overestimate is not the result of assumptions (i) and (ii) but mainly of assumption (iii). To compensate for these shortcomings, in several studies use was made of the concept of tortuosity. Although the concept is intuitively clear, there has been no unanimity in defining it conceptually or mathematically. Clearly, the drier the soil is, the less perfect the remaining pores with water line up, and the more tortuous the flow paths become. For this reason, a common way of implementing the tortuosity effect has consisted of assuming that it is directly proportional with some power of the size of the largest pores, that contain water, and thus of the water content of the soil (see Millington and Quirk, 1964; Mualem, , where is an empirical constant. As noted, this assumption was already used earlier in several of the parallel models (Burdine, 1953; Brooks and Corey, 1966). Subsequently, however, it was observed (Brutsaert, 2000) that this assumption is incapable of producing agreement with experimental data. Rather, it was found necessary to assume that the tortuosity of a flow path through any given pore depends on the characteristic spatialscaleofthatspecificpore,andnotjustonthescaleofthelargestpores.Actually,this assumptionhad alreadybeen used by Fatt andDykstra (1951), in theirparallel model, with the physical justification that liquid flowing through smaller pores travels a more tortuous path; accordingly, they assumed that the tortuosity is inversely proportional to a power of the pore size, say in which is another constant to be determined experimentally. It is straightforward to incorporate this assumption into the series-parallel model pre- sented above, to adjust it for tortuosity and possibly other factors that may not be fully shouldbetakenas(2+c) takenintoaccount.Thus,inEquation(8.46)thepowerof and instead of 2, so that instead of (8.48) one obtains k(cid:7) (2 (S (8.51) field equations of mass and momentum conservation regression 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 DependenceofninEquation(8.36)ontheexponentb Fig.8.31 inthepowerformofthesoil-water retentionrelationship(8.14).ThepointsaretheexperimentalvaluesfromMualem’s(1978) datacollection.Theregressionlineisn=2.18+2.51/b.Alsoshownarethelinesobtainedwith Equations(8.44)and(8.49).(Theparameterb tendstobesmallerforfiner-texturedsoils.)

{"paragraph": "8.4.2 General case of two immiscible fluids in an elastic porous material Biot (1941, 1955, 1956a, b) was probably the first to present a general theory of elasticity of a porous material saturated with an elastic fluid for the three-dimensional case with an arbitrary and variable load. This theory was subsequently (Brutsaert, 1964; Brutsaert and Luthin, 1964) extended to describe the elasticity of an unconsolidated granular material, containing two fluids in its interstices. Later Verruijt (1969) showed that Biot’s theory for a saturated material can be simplified to describe groundwater movement in most cases of practical interest; he thus demonstrated that Biot’s theory can often be reduced to Jacob’s (1940) simple equation but also that in some cases the general theory is the only one that succeeds in explaining experimental results. In what follows, Verruijt’s (1969) develop- ment is combined with Brutsaert’s (1964) two-fluid extension of the theory to obtain a general formulation for unconfined and confined groundwater flow. Although the matter is straightforward, a careful exposition is desirable to bring out the significance of the under- lying assumptions of the various more special groundwater equations used in the technical literature.

The strain components of the solid are defined as xx x xy x etc. Their physical significance is illustrated in Figure 8.32. The position of the center of the cube shown in the figure is at (x ) prior to the deformation, and the displacement components (u ) refer to the displacement of the center of the cube.

Stresses The total stress related to the aforementioned displacements, u, w, and v, consists of three parts, corresponding to the forces acting on each of three phases at a point in space.

It would seem that besides the effect of partial occupancy of the pores by is also water beneath the ground affected by the effective stress path, the pore geometries, the wetting angle, and probably other factors.

Thus the total air pressure is . Whenthetwoimmisciblefluidsareina“funicular”state,thatis,consistingofconnected filaments without isolated drops or occluded bubbles of entrapped gas, the total pressure can be related to the total pressure by the capillary pressure , which is defined as follows: Thiscapillarypressureequalsthepressuredecreaseacrosstheair–waterinterfaceconsidered always present. However, if the process in question involves only wetting, or only drying, so that hysteresis effects are avoided, ) can be taken as a function only of the saturation and of the porosity. The components of the stress tensor and the changes of the displacements of the three phases must satisfy the equations of motion (Brutsaert, 1964) or for slow displacements the simpler equilibrium equations (Verruijt, 1969). However, these are not needed in the present derivation. Stress–strain relationship If the solid strains and the changes in fluid content are small and if the processes involved arereversible,thestresscomponentsmayingeneralbeassumedtobelinearfunctionsofthe strain components (Biot, 1941, 1955). This assumption yields a generalization of Hooke’s law (Brutsaert, 1964) in the case of an isotropic porous material: = 2μe +λe +c +c sw w sa a τ = 2μe +λe +c +c yy yy sw w sa a τ = 2μe +λe +c +c sw w sa a τ = 2μe τ = 2μe τ = 2μe xy xy xz xz yz yz τ = +c +c w sw w w wa a τ = +c +c a sa wa w a a in which are constants characterizing the elastic behavior of sw sa w a wa thematerial.TheseequationsreducetoBiot’s(1955)whentheporesaresaturatedwithone fluid and to Hooke’s law for isotropic bodies if only the solid were present. Thus and represent the behavior of the solid. A fluid displacement does not result in a shear stress, only the rate of displacement does; therefore the fluid strains do not appear in the shear stresscomponents.Thecoefficientc canbeunderstoodbyconsideringthesituationwhere field equations of mass and momentum conservation wetting fluid is forced into the porous material, while the total volume of the other two is somehow kept constant, i.e. when and are kept zero. This means that owing to (8.67), where is the bulk modulus of the wetting fluid and its compressibility. Similarly, for the non-wetting fluid S) (8.69) where is the bulk modulus of the non-wetting fluid. The coefficients and a sw sa wa indicate that, in principle at least, there should be a coupling between the volume changes of the three constituents as indicated by the subscripts. However, as is now shown, these coefficientsareequaltozeroifthedensityofthesolidgrainscanbeassumedtobeconstant. To see this, eliminate the fluid strains from Equation (8.67) to obtain an alternative form of the generalized Hooke law, namely, xx xx 1 2 w 3 a )e (8.70) 1 2 w 3 a 1 2 w 3 a together with the fourth, fifth, and sixth of (8.67). The new constants are (cid:13) (cid:14) 2c (c (c c c c c c c c c c 1 sw sa wa a w 2 sw a sa wa 3 sa w sw wa (cid:13) (cid:14) Consider now a thought experiment in which , the effective stress, is held constant but the fluid pressures are increased. In the case of a porous material containing only one fluid, this can be accomplished by placing an unjacketed saturated sample in the fluid and then increasing the fluid pressure. In the case of material containing air and water, this can be accomplished by increasing and in such a way that their difference remains constant.Itisclearthatifthesolidgraindensityisconstant,thisprocessdoesnotincreasethe effective stresses, nor does it result in any solid displacement. Thus Equation (8.70) shows =c =0, =0 one has also which immediately results in as well. Moreover, if this is the case, one can relate and to the bulk modulus of the solid frame, as follows: Stress versus rate of strain relationships for fluids AsnotedinSection8.3.1,Darcy’slawrepresentstheequationofcreepingmotioninporous material. When the motion takes place within the pores while the porous material itself is being subjected to deformation, the Darcy flux must be taken as the relative motion between the solid matrix and the fluids. Apparently (Verruijt, 1969), this concept was first proposed for liquid saturated media by Gersevanov around 1934. Biot did not use it in his original paper (Biot, 1941), but he introduced it in his generalized theory of elastic- ity (Biot, 1955). The displacement vector of the solid is an actual displacement length, whereas the displacement vectors of the two fluids are defined herein as volumes when multiplied by the total bulk cross-sectional area normal to them. Thus the relative velocity water beneath the ground of the wetting fluid with respect to the solid is S)] and an anal- ogous expression for the nonwetting fluid, so that the respective Darcy fluxes are given When there are two fluids within the same pores, it is clear that the relative motion between the fluids may give rise to an additional “head” loss. This means that Darcy’s law, which expresses a linear relationship between flux and the gradient of pressure and body force, can be written in a general form as follows: ∂w ∂u ∂w ∂v 1 1 1 1 1 kw n0S kwa n0S μ an0(1−S) ∂v ∂u ∂v ∂w 1 1 1 1 1 ka kwa n0S where is the (intrinsic) permeability and is the Newtonian viscosity. (Note that in what follows in this section for convenience of notation the prime symbol is omitted from the permeability terms .) Recall that the total pressure is the sum of the initial p(cid:7) and the incremental pressures, or . Since the initial pressure is hydrostatic, so that it follows that (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) where is the vertical coordinate and the specific weight; the quantity is defined in Equation (8.21). The subscript w refers to the wetting fluid; the same quantities, butwiththesubscripta,refertothenonwettingphase.Thecross-permeabilitytermk arises from the relative motion between the two fluids. For most practical problems, the effect of this relative motion is probably negligible. It is conceivable, however, that it becomes important under conditions of counterflow; this would be the case, for example, of water infiltration into a soil profile in which the displaced air is being prevented from escaping downward so that it bubbles upward while the wetting front moves down. The possibility of momentum exchange as a result of this relative motion has been considered already by Yuster (1951) and Scott and Rose (1953). Mainly because it is practically impossible to determineexperimentallyatpresentandprobablysmall,itisomittedinwhatfollows.Then Equations (8.72) become ∇p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) −n (1− = − The equations presented so far form a complete system. They can be combined to eliminate certain less useful variables and to leave only those pertinent to most practical problems. One way of accomplishing this is to consider the solid displacements and the fluid pressures. Together with the porosity and the degree of saturation, these are seven p(cid:7) p(cid:7) u, , , , variables: and S. If it is assumed that the porous matrix is homogeneous andinert,sothatμ λareconstantandindependentof and andthusofspaceandtime(this (8.70) into the well-known equilibrium equations (for incompressible grains) yields field equations of mass and momentum conservation The fluid displacement terms in Darcy’s law can be eliminated by multiplying each of (8.74) first by and , respectively, and then taking the divergence, after which substi- tution of the continuity equations (8.61) and (8.62) gives ∇p(cid:7) n S] n S ∇p(cid:7) Hence it should be possible to solve it for any consolidation or flow problem involving an elastic porous material occupied by two elastic fluids. Fortunately, for many problems this possible to simplify it considerably as follows. Simple case of constant vertical load In soil mechanics and groundwater hydraulics the problem formulation is commonly sim- plified by two basic assumptions that were introduced by Terzaghi (1925, 1943) and Jacob (1940, 1950). First, compression is assumed to be strictly vertical without any horizontal solid displacements, and second, any changes in vertical compressive effective stress are balanced by equal and opposite changes in fluid stresses. These assumptions may be diffi- culttojustify,buttheresultingformulationhasbeenusedquitesuccessfullyinthesolution of many problems in porous media saturated with one fluid. This suggests that the concept mayalsobevalidinthesimplificationofcertainproblemsinvolvingtwoimmisciblefluids. =u =0, =e In the present notation the first assumption can be written as so that τ = (2μ+λ)e τ = −(τ +τ The second assumption can be written as ), which yields with (8.64) and Noteasanaside,thatEquation(8.78)agreeswiththegeneralobservationthatsoilsthatare closetosaturationdonoteasilydisintegrate,butexhibitacertaindegreeofconsistencyand coherence. Indeed, if the effect of the air pressure can be neglected, in a soil that is close p(cid:7) to saturation, the water pressure is negative and the effective stress factor is close to unity; hence the intergranular stress is also negative, which means that the soil grains are drawn together and the soil exhibits a greater firmness. This effect can also be seen, for example, on a sandy beach just after the sea water has withdrawn during ebb tide; at that p(cid:7) timethesandformsahardersurfacethanwhenitissubmerged,with 0,orthanwhen it is totally dry. χp(cid:7) p(cid:7) Substitution of (8.63) into the first of (8.76) yields (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) ρ +n Sρ β +n ρ =∇ · w 0 w w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t μ water beneath the ground ∂p(cid:7) in which is assumed to be a constant, as a measure of the S)isassumedtobenegligibleon account of the small solid velocity.

The combination of (8.79) with (8.80) and (8.81) yields the following diffusion-type equations: ∂p(cid:7) (χp(cid:7) p(cid:7) w w 0 w w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t ∂t (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) ∂p(cid:7) p(cid:7) (χp(cid:7) a a 0 a a 0 a ∂t ∂t ∂t ∂t (cid:2) (cid:3) ∇p(cid:7) in which, on account of (8.77), can be defined as the vertical compressibility of the solid (2μ+λ)−1 Notethatthisisdifferentfromthevolumetriccompressibility )], xx yy zz that is, the inverse of Equation (8.71). The physical significance of the terms in Equations (8.82) can be explained as follows. The entire left-hand side of both equations represents the local rate of change of storage of the fluid in question at a point. In the case of the first of (8.82), which describes the flow of the water (i.e. the wetting fluid), the first term on the left is the rate of change of storage resulting from compression (or expansion) of the solid matrix caused by pressure changes in the water; the second term represents the storage rate of change caused by compression (or expansion) of the water; the third term is the rate of change of storage resulting from bulk volume changes of the solid matrix caused by pressure changes in the air. The fourth termshowstherateofchangeofwaterstorageresultingfromlocalchangesofthedegreeof saturation. Finally, the right-hand side, which is a divergence of the Darcy flux, represents the storage rate of change as the difference between the inflow and outflow rate of water at the point in question. The different terms of the second of (8.82), which describes the flow of air, represent, mutandis, the same mechanisms as those in the first. Before proceeding, for a better understanding of Equations (8.82) and their limitations, the basic assumptions may be briefly repeated. 1. The grains are incompressible. χ = χ(S). 2. The effective stress is obtainable by means of Bishop’s parameter 3. The solid displacements are sufficiently small, so that the solid frame is elastic withintherangeofu;whenthisisnotthecase,thiscansometimesberemedied.For example, as shown in Brutsaert and Corapcioglu (1976) the basic derivation leading to Equation (8.84) can be readily extended to flow in a viscoelastic aquifer. 4. The solid displacements are vertical only, with a constant total load. Verruijt (1969) has described situations of saturated flow when this assumption is not valid. field equations of mass and momentum conservation 5. The fluid compressibility is defined in Equation (8.80) in terms of partial time derivatives. 6. The terms S) and S)] are negligible. Equations (8.82) are the main result of this section. In principle it should be possible to solve them for appropriate boundary conditions, provided the values of the parameters are known. However, for many common situations they are more general than necessary, and they can be simplified considerably. Some special cases (i) Flowofonepartiallysaturating,elasticfluidinanelasticporousmaterial.Whenever theairpressurecanbeassumedtobeconstant,thesecondequationof(8.82)becomes irrelevant; the first equation of (8.82) can then be written as (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) p(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) w w w 0 w 0 w ∂t ∂t ∂t μ This equation was examined in Brutsaert and El-Kadi (1984) to study the relative effects of partial saturation and compressibility on the flow in unconfined systems. It may be noted that in the groundwater literature, various derivations have been presented; these have yielded results somewhat different from (8.84), mainly in the firsttermontheleft.Somereasonsforthediscrepanciesbetweentheseotherequations and (8.84) stem from the neglect of the relative velocity in Darcy’s law (8.72) and of the equation of continuity of the solid (8.63). The latter assumption is especially serious,since(8.63)involvesthecompressionofthesolid,whichinturngivesriseto the compressibility Other differences result from the use of the total pressure , p(cid:7) rather than , as is done here, and also from the neglect of . (ii) Flow of one elastic fluid in an elastic porous material. This case is the one to which the theory of Biot (1941; 1955) is applicable. Because the pores are filled with one fluidonly,onehas and (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂p(cid:7) k(cid:7) ∇p(cid:7) ρ (α +n β = ∇ · ) (8.85) k(cid:7) inwhichthesymbolk hasbeenreplacedbythemorecommon forthepermeabil- gk(cid:7)/μ ity.Ifnowalsothehydraulicconductivityk )isassumedtobeconstant, (8.85) assumes the well-known linear form: ∂p(cid:7) k∇2p(cid:7) where g[n This form is the same as that of the equa- Equation (8.86), but with various expressions for , has been applied widely in the description of soil consolidation and of flow in confined aquifers. It was proposed for one-dimensional consolidation by Terzaghi (1925), who later (1943) extended it to three dimensions. Independently, Theis (1935) adopted the heat flow equation to analyzehorizontalunsteadyflowinanelasticartesianaquifer,buthejustifieditonly on the basis of heuristic arguments concerning the analogy between Fourier’s law and Darcy’s law. But it was Jacob (1940; 1950) who derived this heat flow equation water beneath the ground for confined aquifer flow in terms of the physical properties of the aquifer and the fluid. Subsequently, however, the exact derivation of Equation (8.86) remained the subject of controversy, until Verruijt (1969) showed how it can be reconciled with Biot’s (1941; 1955) analysis. InadditiontothelimitationsinherentinEquation(8.84),theTerzaghi–Jacobequa- tion (8.86) is also restricted by the assumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity. k(cid:7) As shown earlier in this chapter, the permeability is dependent on the porosity ; k(cid:7) isproportionalton2 they are in fact unknown dependent variables. In other words, it is assumed that the fluid and the porous matrix are compressible on the left side of (8.85) but not on the ∇p(cid:7) right. This assumption may have its limitations whenever is not small. Still, in spite of this inconsistency, for most problems the exact formulation of (8.86) in terms of physical properties of the porous material and the fluid is probably not very crucial, since (S is usually determined from field experiments. Consequently, as k(cid:7) irrotational or unidirectional displacement and the constancy of and may be ,β ,μ,λ, difficulttojustify,themainproblemisnothowtoexpress intermsof etc., at the micro- or Darcy scale, but rather whether the heat flow equation (8.86) is adequate to solve the practical problem at hand at the larger scale of the aquifer.

Equations (8.88) have been used to study the effect of soil air movement on the infiltration of water (Le Van Phuc and Morel-Seytoux, 1972; Morel-Seytoux, 1973). Whenever the effect of the non-wetting fluid is negligible, owing to small viscosity ∇p(cid:7) and small pressure changes , only the wetting fluid is of interest; if the density of this fluid is constant, (8.87) reduces to ·(k∇p(cid:7) which is equivalent to Equation (8.55), first derived by Richards (1931) for soil water movement.

PROBLEMS", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, what is the significance of Biot's theory for a saturated material, and how does it relate to Jacob's simple equation?", "answer": "Biot's theory for a saturated material can often be reduced to Jacob's simple equation, but in some cases, the general theory is the only one that succeeds in explaining experimental results. This indicates that while Jacob's equation may be sufficient for most practical purposes, Biot's theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of groundwater movement, especially in complex scenarios. The relationship between these two theories highlights the importance of considering the underlying assumptions and limitations of each equation when applying them to real-world problems."}, {"question": "How do the displacements of the solid, water, and air in a porous material relate to each other, and what are the implications for the stress-strain relationship?", "answer": "The displacements of the solid, water, and air in a porous material are interconnected, with the solid displacement affecting the water and air displacements. The stress-strain relationship in the material is influenced by these displacements, with the effective stress being a key factor. The effective stress is related to the fluid pressures and the solid displacement, and it plays a crucial role in determining the material's behavior under different loading conditions. Understanding these relationships is essential for predicting the material's response to various external forces and for designing engineering systems that involve porous materials."}, {"question": "In the context of two immiscible fluids in an elastic porous material, what is the role of the effective stress function, and how does it affect the behavior of the material?", "answer": "The effective stress function, denoted by χ, is a concept introduced for partially saturated soils by Bishop. It is generally accepted that χ equals zero when the degree of saturation is zero and that it is close to unity when the degree of saturation is one. The effective stress function affects the behavior of the material by influencing the stress-strain relationship and the fluid flow. The value of χ depends on the degree of saturation, and it is a critical parameter in understanding the mechanical behavior of partially saturated porous materials."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the relative motion between the two fluids in a porous material, and how does it impact the Darcy flux?", "answer": "The relative motion between the two fluids in a porous material can give rise to an additional \"head\" loss, which affects the Darcy flux. This is because the relative motion between the fluids can lead to momentum exchange, which in turn influences the fluid flow. Considering the relative motion is essential for accurately predicting the behavior of the fluids in the porous material, especially in situations where counterflow occurs, such as during water infiltration into a soil profile."}, {"question": "In the context of flow in an elastic porous material, what are the limitations of the Terzaghi-Jacob equation, and how do they impact its applicability?", "answer": "The Terzaghi-Jacob equation has several limitations, including the assumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity, which may not always be valid. Additionally, the equation is restricted to situations where the fluid and the porous matrix are compressible on the left side of the equation but not on the right. These limitations can impact the equation's applicability, especially in situations where the hydraulic conductivity varies significantly or where the compressibility of the fluid and the matrix is important. Despite these limitations, the Terzaghi-Jacob equation has been widely used and has been successful in solving many problems in porous media saturated with one fluid."}, {"question": "How does the concept of effective stress relate to the behavior of soils that are close to saturation, and what are the implications for soil consistency and coherence?", "answer": "The concept of effective stress is crucial in understanding the behavior of soils that are close to saturation. When a soil is close to saturation, the water pressure is negative, and the effective stress factor is close to unity. This means that the intergranular stress is also negative, causing the soil grains to be drawn together and resulting in a greater firmness. This effect can be observed in natural settings, such as on a sandy beach after the sea water has withdrawn during ebb tide. The soil forms a harder surface than when it is submerged or totally dry, demonstrating the importance of effective stress in determining soil consistency and coherence."}, {"question": "In the context of flow in a porous material, what is the significance of the capillary pressure, and how does it relate to the total pressure?", "answer": "The capillary pressure is the pressure decrease across the air-water interface and is defined as the difference between the total pressure and the water pressure. It is an important parameter in understanding the behavior of two immiscible fluids in a porous material. The capillary pressure is related to the total pressure, which is the sum of the initial pressure and the incremental pressures. Understanding the capillary pressure and its relationship to the total pressure is essential for predicting the behavior of the fluids in the porous"}]}

(a) Consider a field situation with a stationary (i.e., not moving) horizontal water table at a depth of 1.0 m below the soil surface. If the soil profile is in equilibrium (i.e., no flow) and evaporation is negligible, what is horizontal water table at 1.0 m depth in that same soil profile. You know that the soil moisture profile was originally (say one day earlier) in equilibrium (with the water table at some unknown depth), but you suspect that the water table is now moving vertically. If the water content at the soil surface is n , decide whether the water table is rising or falling. (There is no precipitation and evaporation at the surface.) Prove your answer.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the empirical formula provided, how does the water content relate to the suction in the water for a given sandy soil?", "answer": "The water content is related to the suction in the water by the formula (cid:16) (cid:17) + 0.1H)6, where is the porosity, and is expressed in cm of water column, indicating a direct relationship between water content and suction."}, {"question": "Why is the soil moisture profile considered to be in equilibrium when the water table is stationary and there is no flow or evaporation?", "answer": "The soil moisture profile is considered to be in equilibrium because there are no external factors (like precipitation or evaporation) affecting the water balance, and the stationary water table indicates that the groundwater level is not changing, thus no net flow of water is occurring within the soil profile."}, {"question": "In the scenario described, how would you determine if the water table is rising or falling based on the water content at the soil surface?", "answer": "To determine if the water table is rising or falling, one would compare the current water content at the soil surface (n) with the expected water content if the water table were at equilibrium at the given depth (1.0 m). If the water content at the surface is higher than expected, it suggests the water table is rising, bringing more water to the surface. Conversely, if the water content is lower, it implies the water table is falling, reducing the water available at the surface."}, {"question": "What implications does the movement of the water table have on the soil moisture profile, and why is this important in hydrological studies?", "answer": "The movement of the water table significantly affects the soil moisture profile because it changes the amount of water available to the soil. This is crucial in hydrological studies because understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting water availability, managing groundwater resources, and assessing the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems. The movement of the water table can lead to changes in soil moisture, affecting plant growth, runoff generation, and groundwater recharge, making it a critical factor in water balance calculations and hydrological modeling."}, {"question": "How does the absence of precipitation and evaporation at the surface influence the interpretation of changes in the water table depth?", "answer": "The absence of precipitation and evaporation simplifies the interpretation of changes in the water table depth because it eliminates two significant variables that could otherwise complicate the analysis. Without these factors, any changes in the water table can be more directly attributed to internal hydrological processes, such as groundwater flow or changes in soil moisture storage, allowing for a clearer understanding of the system's dynamics."}, {"question": "In the context of the given empirical formula, what role does porosity play in determining the water content of the soil?", "answer": "Porosity (represented by the symbol) plays a crucial role in the empirical formula as it directly influences the water content. The formula suggests that as porosity increases, the water content also increases for a given suction value, indicating that soils with higher porosity can retain more water."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the initial equilibrium state of the soil moisture profile when analyzing changes in the water table depth?", "answer": "Considering the initial equilibrium state is essential because it provides a baseline for understanding the direction and magnitude of changes in the water table. By knowing the initial conditions, one can better interpret the implications of changes in the water table depth, such as whether the water table is rising or falling, and how this might affect the soil moisture profile and overall hydrological balance."}, {"question": "How does the empirical formula provided relate to the broader context of hydrological processes, such as groundwater flow and soil moisture dynamics?", "answer": "The empirical formula relates to the broader context of hydrological processes by quantifying the relationship between water content and suction in the soil, which is fundamental to understanding groundwater flow and soil moisture dynamics. This relationship is critical in modeling and predicting hydrological responses to various scenarios, including changes in precipitation, evaporation, and water table depth, thereby informing water resource management and environmental assessment efforts."}, {"question": "In the scenario where the water table is moving vertically, what are the implications for the soil moisture profile, and how might this affect hydrological predictions?", "answer": "The vertical movement of the water table has significant implications for the soil moisture profile, as it can lead to changes in the amount of water stored in the soil and available for plant uptake or runoff. This, in turn, can affect hydrological predictions, such as the timing and magnitude of runoff events, groundwater recharge rates, and the overall water balance. Accurately accounting for these dynamics is crucial for reliable hydrological modeling and water resource management."}, {"question": "How does the given scenario, with its specific conditions (e.g., stationary water table, no precipitation or evaporation), contribute to the understanding of more complex hydrological systems?", "answer": "The given scenario contributes to the understanding of more complex hydrological"}]}

At the local scale, as precipitated water reaches the ground surface, into the soil takes place. In infiltration between precipitation events, the atmosphere exerts its drying effect, and the water in the soil profile may move to the surface by and by liquid rise, vapor diffusion capillary where it evaporates. As illustrated in Figure 8.23, a small decrease in water content below saturation can cause a significant decrease in conductivity, so that in most soils the difference in hydraulic conductivity above and below the water table can be large. At an inter- face between soils with different conductivities, the streamlines are known to exhibit a pronounced refraction; therefore, in many situations unsaturated flow above the water table can be assumed to be nearly vertical, whereas the saturated flow below the water table can be assumed to be more horizontal or parallel to underlying impervious layers. Accordingly, in this chapter, infiltration and related flow phenomena in the partly satu- rated zone of the soil are analyzed in a one-dimensional vertical framework. Similarly, in Chapter 10, it is shown how many saturated flow situations can be analyzed in the one-dimensional framework of hydraulic groundwater theory. Because the infiltration capacity constitutes an upper limit of maximal rate of entry into the soil, it is treated first in Sections 9.2 and 9.3; rain infiltration is treated in Section 9.4.

In field situations there may be such important complications as the effect of air movement, areal variability and stratification of soil properties, an impermeable layer at shallow depth, the effect of crusting at the soil surface, fingering, non-uniform initial water content after redistribution during a period of drainage and evaporation, and others.

For example, it is not unusual that, when there is a shallow impermeable layer or a shallow water table below a relatively flat surface ponded with water, bubbling of air can be observed; this is evidence of a counterflow of air, which undoubtedly (see Linden and Dixon, 1975) reduces the water intake rate. Several mathematical formulations have been developed to describe infiltration as a flow problem of two immiscible fluids. Examples of these can be found in the studies by McWhorter (1971) and Sonu and Morel-Seytoux (1976).

In experiments dealing with natural soils, a difference of 2% is very difficult to detect. Soil variability The spatial variability of soil properties has been studied with measurements in the field have been made with remotely sensed data (Cosh and Brutsaert, 1999).

These instabilities are a result of the differences in soil properties between layers, which can affect the flow of water and air. The effects of such stratification and the formation of crusts at the surface have been studied, but the exact mechanisms and implications for infiltration rates and patterns are complex and require further investigation."}, {"question": "How does the presence of surface-connected macroporosity, such as shrinkage cracks, wormholes, or root channels, influence the infiltration process?", "answer": "The presence of surface-connected macroporosity can significantly influence the infiltration process by providing pathways for rapid water infiltration.

{"paragraph": "9.4.2 Time to ponding Consider for this analysis the simplest possible case of precipitation on the surface of a deep uniform soil profile. One of the oldest approximate methods for solving nonlinear diffusion equations like (9.1) consists of considering the problem as a succession of steady states. In groundwater theory it was used as early as 1886 by K. E. Lembke that is (9.6) with in the analysis of the drainage or desorption problem. Later, essentially the same method was applied by Landahl (1953) in the solution of the linear diffusion equation and was then generalized by Macey (1959) to the nonlinear diffusion equation (9.6) for sorption; Parlange (1971) applied the concept to derive a first estimate φ = φ(θ) = = of the soil water profile for sorption, that is (9.32) with 1 and 0. Parlange (1972) and Parlange and Smith (1976) then explored the same approach to study rainfall infiltration; this quasi-steady state approach is described next. Sharp front approach Theapproachisbasedontheassumptionofasharpwettingfront,suchthat,oncethisfront haspassedapoint,thewatercontentθ isalreadysoclosetosatiationthatitdoesnotchange much from then on. Thus the term in the Richards equation (9.1) can be neglected, so that the term on the right-hand side becomes zero; this means that the specific flux is the sameatallz,includingatthesurface,z 0,whereitisequaltotheprecipitationintensityP. This is in accordance with the second of (9.5), and can be integrated a second time to yield where is the water content at the soil surface 0, which changes with time as the precipitation proceeds. In Equations (9.15) and (9.63) the infiltrated volume is obtained rain infiltration by integration of as illustrated in Figure 9.4, this can also be accomplished by integration of so that one can write instead = (θ −θ +k )dz (9.79) where is the position of the wetting front. In the present situation is also the time integral of the precipitation rate, or These two expressions for the cumulative infiltration, namely (9.79) and (9.80) can be combined to yield (cid:4) (cid:4) in which it is assumed that , the conductivity at the initial water content, is negligibly (9.81) produces (cid:4) (cid:4) This is an important result in that it represents a relationship between the water content at the soil surface and time, (t) prior to ponding. The time to ponding can be derived from Equation (9.82), by considering it as the time necessary for the surface soil moisture content to reach satiation, or .

{"paragraph": "9.4.3 Infiltration after the start of ponding: time compression approximation Prior to the time of ponding, the precipitated water can readily enter into the soil, and the rate of infiltration is equal to the precipitation rate, as indicated by the second of Equations (9.5). Once ponding starts, the soil surface is satiated, that is , so that the boundary condition at 0 becomes the third of (9.5), which is the same as the secondof(9.62)fortheinfiltrationcapacityproblem.However,theinitialconditionatthe infiltration and related unsaturated flows startofpondingisquitedifferentfromtheinitialconditionusedtodescribetheinfiltration capacity, i.e. the first of (9.62). In fact, the initial soil water content distribution at the start of ponding cannot be prescribed in general beforehand, because it will depend on the specifics of the duration and intensity of infiltration prior to ponding for each rainfall event. Because a detailed solution of Richards’s equation for each rainfall occurrence is neitherpracticalnorfeasible,itisusefultoexplorefurthersimplificationoftheproblem. Several parameterizations of rainfall infiltration that have been proposed in the past involvetheconceptoftimecompression(alsocalledtimecondensation),orsomeassump- tion similar to it. Briefly, the underlying assumption is that the potential infiltration rate, at any given time after the onset of ponding within a rain storm period, depends only on the previous cumulative infiltration volume, regardless of the previous infiltration or rainfallhistoryduringthatsamestorm.Thetimecompressionapproximation(TCA)was introduced in the 1940s (see Sherman, 1943; Holtan, 1945) in the context of partitioning the rainfall on a watershed into runoff and infiltration, and was later applied in many other studies (see Reeves and Miller, 1975; Sivapalan and Milly, 1989; Salvucci and Entekhabi, 1994; Kim al., 1996). Conceptually, TCA can be considered another instance of the application of the lumped kinematic approach, as formulated in Equation (1.10). Thus the soil profile is a one-dimensional control volume, the rate of infiltration is the inflow rate , and the cumulative infiltration is the storage S. After the inception of ponding, the inflow rate is assumed to be a function of the storage only, independent of the precipitation history. General formulation Let (t) and F(t) denote the actual infiltration rate and actual cumulative infiltration,respectively;asthesearefunctionsoftime,onealsohastheinversefunctions for the infiltration capacity, that is under potential conditions, as analyzed in Section 9.3. and subject to boundary conditions (9.2); their inverse can be written, respectively as t( ) and t(F ). The basic assumption of TCA can be expressed as follows (t(F F)) With a constant (or average) rate of rainfall P, the cumulative infiltration at the time of incipient ponding is (Pt ). Define now the (fictitious) compression reference time as the time period after the start of rainfall that would be required to produce the same infiltrated volume, but under potential conditions. Thus one has p p c cr fromwhicht ort canbeestimated.Oncet andt areknown,thecumulativeinfiltration cr p cr p is given by F(t) for c p cr p rain infiltration In light of (9.90), the rate of infiltration is f f t t t c p cr p In Equations (9.92) and (9.93) the time to ponding and the compression reference time remain to be determined. These two variables are related by (9.91); as this is one equa- tion with two unknowns, additional information is needed to solve for and . The time to ponding is a real physical quantity, whereas the compression reference time is essentially a parameter, arising in the TCA approximation. There are two possible procedures of estimating . In the first, it is obtained from the time to ponding; the latterisestimatedindependently,frommeasurementsorwithexpressionslikeEquations (9.86) or (9.89). In the second procedure, use is made of the precipitation intensity to solve for both and by means of the TCA approximation. Estimation with the correct time to ponding In the first procedure the value of is determined independently and with a known or tolerable accuracy. The time to ponding can be measured directly, as in controlled situations during irrigation, or by appropriate observations; also, as reviewed in the previous section, there are reliable expressions available for this purpose, which are basedonthesolutionofRichards’sequation(seeParlangeandSmith,1976;Broadbridge and White, 1987). With known, one obtains then as the inverse of Equation (9.91) t(F ) (9.94) in which the subscript 1 indicates that is obtained by the first alternative procedure. Note that with this procedure the infiltration rate has a discontinuity at (see Figure 9.17). This is unavoidable, and is a result of the approximate nature of TCA. However, the basic assumption of TCA, expressed in Equation (9.90), is satisfied. Estimation from the precipitation intensity In past applications of TCA, it has usually not been assumed that the time to ponding canbedeterminedindependently.Rather,t hasusuallybeenestimatedbyassuming,that under potential conditions is the time after the start of rainfall that would be required to produce not only the same infiltrated volume, i.e. (Pt ) as at the time of ponding, but also the same infiltration rate, i.e. P. Thus one has the additional equation, from which the compression reference time is obtained as the simple inverse function t( P); the subscript 2 indicates that it is estimated by this second alternative procedure. The time to ponding can then be calculated by means of Equation (9.91) as This procedure is illustrated in Figure 9.18. In the real world, it is certainly the case that at the time of ponding both and must be satisfied. But it should be kept in mind that the TCA concept is only infiltration and related unsaturated flows Fig.9.17 Illustrationofthetimecompressionmethod,asgivenbyEquation (9.92),toestimatethecumulative F P.Inthisversionofthemethodthetimeto infiltration (heavyline),resultingfromprecipitationrate pondingisdeterminedindependently,andpresumedtobecorrect.Atthetimeofpondingt tp,the F Fc curveatt tcr,butitsslopeisnotequaltothatofthe Fc valueof isequaltothatofthe curveat t tcr;thus,theinfiltrationrate f hasadiscontinuityatt tp,buttheinfiltratedvolume F satisfies themainpremiseoftimecompression.

The time to ponding is such a crucial parameter in describing rainfall infiltration, that the first procedure to determine the compression reference time should be used, if at all possible. Because TCAismainlyconcernedwithmassconservationandcumulativeinfiltration,andlessso pointed out by J.-Y. Parlange (Liu al., 1998), the first procedure with is preferable over the second with . The following example should give an idea of the practical implementation of the TCA concept and of the error involved in the estimation of by means of the second procedure. Example 9.3. Application with truncated time expansion Theaboveequationsforrainfallinfiltrationcanbeappliedwithanyoftheavailableequa- tions for infiltration capacity or discussed in Section 9.3. The calculations become especially simple when time can be expressed explicitly as a function of infiltration capacity.Considerasanexamplethetruncatedtimeexpansion(9.75)proposedbyPhilip (1957a). By using the procedure, with the correct value of determined independently, one obtains from (9.94) for the compression reference time, implicitly and, after solution, explicitly )1/2]2/b2 = [−a + + in which and are the constants appearing in Equation (9.75). With the second procedure, which is based on the infiltration rate constraint, by combining (9.95) with (9.75) one obtains the following = [a/(P − The time to incipient ponding can be calculated by substitution of (9.98) into (9.91), which yields with the cumulative infiltration corresponding to (9.75), With the values of and known, by either of the two procedures, the cumulative F Pt t t F t t t t p cr p cr p and in a similar way, the rate of infiltration (9.93). The error involved in the second TCA procedure can be determined by comparing the the previous section.

As seen in Equations (9.92) and (9.100), an underestimated time to ponding produces an underestimate of the infiltration F. Accuracy of the TCA approximation Several studies allow an assessment of the time compression approximation. One is the analysis of intermittent infiltration by Ibrahim and Brutsaert (1968), on the basis of the numerical solution of Equation (9.1) for conditions representing alternating potential infil- trationanddrainage(orredistribution)cycles.Thehysteresisinthesoilwatercharacteristic was taken into account by means of the concept of independent domain. Inspection of the results shows that the cumulative infiltration, after restarting it following a drainage period of a given duration, can be obtained by merely time-shifting the initial (i.e. prior to the drainage) cumulative potential infiltration curve over a certain time period; however, the required time-shift period tends to be shorter than the drainage period, which is the time-shift assumed under TCA. This means that TCA usually underestimates infiltration. SimilarresultswereobtainedbyReevesandMiller(1975);althoughinsomeextremecases the reported error was as large as 15% to 20%, in most cases it was considerably smaller. catchment-scale infiltration and other “losses” Liu (1998) estimated the error in the TCA solution by comparing it with the exact solutionofrainfallinfiltrationforthespecialcaseofthelinearizedRichardsequationwith- out gravitational effect, that is Equation (9.6) with a constant . The differences between the two solutions were very small, with the largest occurring near ponding. The maximal error in cumulative infiltration was found to be an underestimate of only 1.3% for and (9.96); similarly small errors were obtained for the rates of infiltration. On the other hand the second procedure underestimated the time to ponding obtained with (9.96) by about 19%. This illustrates that can be a sensitive parameter and that conversely, errors in will cause much smaller error in the resulting or f. The sensitivity issue was also dealt with by White al.

Nevertheless, as long as its limitations are kept in mind, the concept can be useful, especially in situations with limited data and for design purposes involving large flows and floods. There have been two major ways of applying the loss rate concept; in the first, which is used more commonlyforlargebasins,itisassumedthatthelossisindependentoftherainfall,while in the second one, which is more widely used for smaller areas, the loss is assumed to be proportional to the rainfall. Loss rate independent of rainfall In this approach the loss rate is usually taken as a constant rate throughout the rainstorm event, and it is subtracted from the actual rainfall intensity to obtain the excess rainfall intensity.Theunderlyingideaisthatthislossraterepresentsmainlythespace-andtime- averaged behavior of the infiltration capacity which is controlled by the properties of the soil and which is independent of the rainfall intensities, as long as they are large enough. Several such indices have been proposed in the past, but Horton’s (1937) method has probably been most widely used. In brief, the loss rate is determined as the constant value that must be subtracted from the actual rainfall rate so that the resulting excess rainfall volume over the entire catchment is equal to the actual storm runoff volume; this storm runoff is derived from the streamflow hydrograph by subtracting the (assumed) baseflow from the total runoff. When rainfall is observed at several gages, their input must be properly weighted with their respective areas of influence (see Section 3.3.1) and several trial loss rates are required to obtain the solution. This method is often applied in modified form, by the inclusion of an initial loss, which is a certain amount that is subtracted from the rainfall at the beginning of the storm event. The principle is illustrated in Figure 9.20. The initial loss can be defined as the loss that takes place before the onset of storm runoff in the stream, and it is usually envisioned to consist of interception storage, depression storage and initial high rate catchment-scale infiltration and other “losses” 0 2 4 6 8 10 Loss rate (mm h floodestimation.Thecirclesrepresentalllossratescombinedasweightedaveragesfrom101 watershedsintheUS,24watershedsinAustraliaand8watershedsinNewZealand.Thetriangles representthesmallestlossratesobservedin60watershedsintheUnitedStates. infiltration. Various methods have been in use to determine the initial loss, but all of them have drawbacks. In the most obvious method the initial loss is taken as all the rain prior to the start of the rise in the stream flow; but this is not always applicable, because often the rain may be finished before the stream flow hydrograph shows any rise. This difficulty can be avoided by considering as initial loss the maximal isolated burst of rainfall observed in the record, which was not reflected in an obvious rise in the streamflow hydrograph. Another way is to make use of a “typical delay period,” which can be derived from the record as the delay between short, intense storms and the subsequent start of the rise in the streamflow hydrograph; when the storm is sufficiently intense, the initial loss can be assumed to be negligible. This period can then serve to determinethestartoftherainfallexcess,i.e.theendoftheinitiallossperiod,instormsof longer duration. Examples of the application of the loss rate methodology can be found shown how the initial loss can be related to an antecedent precipitation index, which he used as a measure of the wetness of the catchment. To give an idea of the values that can be expected for the constant loss rate, Figure 9.21 presents a summary of the data collection of Pilgrim (1966). The circles represent the loss rate frequency as a weighted average of 460 values from 101 water- sheds in the United States, 150 values from 24 Australian watersheds and 116 values from 8 watersheds in New Zealand; the results for the three data sets were sufficiently similar so that they could be combined in one single curve.

Although the basic approach was proposed some 150 years ago (Mulvany,1850; Dooge, 1957), various versions of the Rational Method are still in common use in the design of road culverts and other structures draining small areas of a few square kilometers at most.

It is therefore best expressed in terms of measurements in the atmosphere. For a moist surface under natural conditions, several well-known formulations are available, which make use of atmospheric variables and which are treated in Chapter 4. Obviously, for constant atmospheric conditions, the rate of drying is constant. The duration of the first stage depends on the rate of evaporation and the ability of the soil profile to supply this As the soil near the surface dries out, the water supply to the surface eventually falls below that required by the atmospheric conditions. In this second or falling-rate stage, the rateofevaporationismainlylimitedbythesoilmoistureconditionsandthesoilproperties, andmuchlessbytheavailableenergy.Thetransitionfromthefirststagetothesecondstage may be quite abrupt at a given point on the surface; on a wider scale it is usually more gradual, because local transitions at different locations tend to occur at different times. It was noted by Jackson (1976) that the transition from the first to the second stage can be observed visually by changes in color and in albedo. Inthesecondstageofdrying,watermovesalsothroughtheprofilebydiffusionofwater vapor. And especially after the soil has become quite dry, the water transport through the profile is sensitive to the temperature gradients in the soil as well.

This formulation, which was first used by Gardner (1959), is based on several additional assumptions, beside that of isothermal liquid flow. First, it is assumed that the effect of gravity is negligible. In other words, it is assumed that the drying rate of a vertical soil column is the same as that of a horizontal aretakentobesameasgivenin(9.7),exceptthatindesorption,insteadofθ ,letθ represent the water content at the dry soil surface, so that ; thus, when applied to this case, in the first of (9.7) it is assumed that the initial water content is uniform, and in the second thatthewatercontentatthesurfaceisalwaysverylow.Theseconditionsareequivalentwith the assumption that the energy-limiting drying rate is so large, that the duration of the first stage of drying is negligibly short. Third, vapor transfer in the drier soil near the surface is neglected. As was the case for the sorption problem, by applying the Boltzmann transform (9.11), Equation (9.6) can be reduced to the ordinary differential equation (9.13). Because in desorption the water content is normalized as so that, instead of (9.14), the boundary conditions are θ = θ = φ → ∞ θ = θ = φ = (or 0) 0 To date no general exact solution has been obtained for this problem, but only approximate solutions or exact solutions for certain types of diffusivity functions. Gardner (1959) made use of two solutions. One was the linearized solution obtained by means of a weighted mean diffusivity calculated by Crank’s method; his second solution, which was presented graphically, was obtained by iteration for the exponential-type diffusivity (8.39). Parlange (1985) proposed an approximate, but quite accurate method of solution for arbitrary (θ),inamannersimilartothetechniquesusedforsorption.Finally, diffusivityfunctions it has been shown by Brutsaert (1982) that there is a large class of functions that admit exact solutions for desorption as formulated by Equations (9.13) and (9.107); one such function, in particular appeared to have practical relevance to flow in soils and other porousmaterials.Adetaileddiscussionofthesemethodsofsolutionisbeyondthescopeof the present treatment. Inthepresentcontext,however,themostinterestingfeatureofanysolutionbymeansof the Boltzmann transform, regardless of the solution method and regardless of the assumed diffusivity function is that the total water volume lost from the soil profile is pro- φ(θ)t1/2 solution it can readily be shown that the flux at the surface, that is the rate of evaporation can be written as where can be referred to as the capillary desorptivity, and is defined by which is a constant for a given soil and given values of and . infiltration and related unsaturated flows Fig.9.23 Cumulative evaporationfrom abaresoilsurface asafunctionof thesquarerootof timeobtainedin thelaboratory witha1.0mlong columnofclay soil.(After Gardner,1959.) 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 t1/2 1/2) Good agreement was obtained by Gardner (1959) between (9.108) and the evaporation rate from an initially uniformly moist column of clay soil, 100 cm in length, subjected in the laboratory to a large potential evaporation rate of about 4 cm These results are showninFigure9.23.Evidently,thecolumnwaslongenoughtobeeffectivelysemi-infinite for about 100 d. Similar results were presented by Gardner and Hillel (1962); in addition they observed that soon after the end of the first stage of drying, the rate of evaporation is independent of the initial drying rate, and that it depends primarily on the water content of the soil. These successful experimental tests of the desorption approach were obtained under constant atmospheric conditions in the laboratory, and should lend support to the underlying assumptions. Nevertheless, it can be expected that the neglect of gravity will somehowresultinanoverestimateoftheevaporationrate,whereastheneglectofthevapor transfer must result in an underestimate of the evaporation.

This transition is influenced by the rate of evaporation and the ability of the soil profile to supply water. The transition may be abrupt at a given point but is usually more gradual on a wider scale due to local transitions occurring at different times."}, {"question": "How does the desorption-based parameterization simplify the problem of unsteady drying of the soil profile, and what assumptions are made in this formulation?", "answer": "The desorption-based parameterization simplifies the problem by considering the second stage of drying as a problem of desorption, assuming isothermal liquid flow, negligible gravity effects, and neglecting vapor transfer in the drier soil near the surface. This formulation also assumes that the energy-limiting drying rate is so large that the duration of the first stage of drying is negligibly short.

The capillary desorptivity, defined by the equation provided, is a constant for a given soil and given values of initial and final water contents. This relationship and the concept of capillary desorptivity are significant because they provide a way to predict the rate of evaporation from the soil surface based on soil properties."}, {"question": "Why are the experimental tests of the desorption approach, as conducted by Gardner and others, considered successful, and what implications do these tests have for understanding soil evaporation?", "answer": "The experimental tests are considered successful because they showed good agreement between the predicted and observed evaporation rates from soil columns under controlled laboratory conditions. These tests imply that the desorption approach can accurately model the second stage of drying, where evaporation is limited by soil moisture and properties. However, the tests also highlight the need for further study to account for the effects of gravity and vapor transfer, which were neglected in the desorption formulation."}, {"question": "How does the neglect of gravity and vapor transfer in the desorption formulation potentially affect the accuracy of predicted evaporation rates, and what challenges does this pose for modeling real-world scenarios?", "answer": "The neglect of gravity may result in an overestimate of the evaporation rate, while the neglect of vapor transfer may lead to an underestimate. These effects may partially compensate for each other, but further study is required to fully understand their impact. This poses a challenge for modeling real-world scenarios, where both gravity and vapor transfer play significant roles, and highlights the need for more complex models that can account for these factors to improve the accuracy of evaporation rate predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of soil evaporation, what is the significance of the first stage of drying, and how does it relate to the overall process of unsteady drying of the soil profile?", "answer": "The first stage of drying is significant because it is the period during which the evaporation rate is primarily controlled by atmospheric conditions. This stage is important for understanding the initial response of the soil to evaporation demands. As the soil dries, the transition to the second stage occurs, where soil properties and moisture conditions become the limiting factors. Understanding the first stage is crucial for predicting the onset and duration of the second stage, which is critical for managing water resources and predicting soil moisture dynamics."}, {"question": "Why is the desorption approach useful for modeling the second stage of drying, and what advantages does it offer over other methods?", "answer": "The desorption approach is useful because it provides a simplified formulation that can capture the essential features of the second stage of drying, where evaporation is limited by soil properties and moisture. This approach offers the advantage of reducing the complexity of the problem to an ordinary differential equation, which can be solved using various methods, including the Boltzmann transform. The desorption approach also allows for the derivation of the capillary desorptivity, a constant that relates to the soil's ability to supply water during the drying process, making it a valuable tool for predicting evaporation rates and understanding soil behavior under different conditions."}]}

Nevertheless, as will be shown below, under certain conditions the assumption that soil surface evaporation takes place in two stages, and that the second stage can be described by a desorption formulation, is still a useful construct to describedryingphenomena.Butitshouldbekeptinmindthat,whenever(9.108)isapplied underconditionsotherthanthosespecifiedby(9.6)and(9.107),itdoesnotreallyrepresent a capillary desorption phenomenon, in the strict sense of the word. Therefore, the value of obtained this way is probably better referred to as “effective” desorptivity. Daily evaporation from bare soil In several field studies it was found that E(t) could be described reasonably well as a desorptionphenomenonbyEquation(9.108),providedthiswasdonewithdailytimesteps. et al. t was set to zero after each heavy rainfall, and daily evaporation from a bare soil lysimeter measured during an entire summer. The measurements illustrated in Figure 9.24 suggested d−1/2.Interestingly,thisvaluewasalso aneffectivedesorptivityofaround cm =0.43cmd−1/2,calculatedbymeansofCrank’s notverydifferentfromthedesorptivityDe linearizedsolution.Inlightofthenaturalvariabilityofthesoil,andalsoofthelikelyerrors stemmingfromtheproblemformulationanditslinearization,thedifferenceissmall.Black etal.(1969)suspectedthatafterarainfalltheevaporationwouldeventuallydepartfromthe relationship,becauseofthefinitedepthofwetting.Still,itwaspossibletosimulatean entiresummerofevaporationthisway.InasimilarstudyinCalifornia,Parlangeetal.(1992) assumed that daily evaporation from a bare soil lysimeter followed the pattern of (9.108) immediatelyafterirrigationofthefield;withthisassumptiontheirmeasurementssuggested d−1/2.InArizona,Jacksonetal.(1976)foundthat aneffectivedesorptivity cm Equation(9.108)couldbeusedtodescribethesecondstageofdryingonadailybasisfrom infiltration and related unsaturated flows 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 T e m p e r a t u r e , T ( ) inmmd−1/2,asmeasuredbya Fig.9.25 Thetemperaturedependencyoftheeffectivedesorptivity weighinglysimeterwithloaminArizona(opencircles),andofthenormalizedwatervapor diffusivity(curve).Theindicatedtemperatureistheaverageofthefivedailyaveragesforthe firstfivedaysofthesoil-limitingphase.(AfterJacksonetal.,1976.) thoseportionsofafieldwhosesurfacemoisturecontentwasbelowacertainthresholdvalue; however,theyalsofoundthat exhibitsastrongdependencyontemperature,varyingby afactorofabout2fromwintertosummer.InFigure9.25thesemeasuredvaluesof can be compared with the normalized temperature dependency of the water vapor diffusivity; the similarity of both dependencies suggests that vapor diffusion contributes substantially to the total water transport in the top layer of the soil. Inthesethreefieldstudieswithdailytimesteps,thetransitionbetweenthefirstandsecond stage of drying appears to have been relatively abrupt. Jackson (1976) concluded that at the field scale any gradual transition was mainly caused by the variability of the surface soilmoisture,sothatthefieldwaspartlyinthefirstandinthesecondstageofdrying.Inthe analyses of the bare-soil lysimeter measurements by Black (1969) and by Parlange (1992), the desorptive stage was assumed to have started immediately after the water application had ceased, and the first stage was dispensed with. Time compression approximation Inthetwobare-soillysimeterstudiesjustmentioned,thedesorptionformulationwasimple- (cid:23) mented by simply plotting the cumulative evaporation against the square root of time to fit a linear relation through the origin, and the end of the precipitation or the irriga- tion was taken as the starting point. Whenever the first stage is short or nonexistent, this procedure may be acceptable. However, because Equation (9.108) is a nonlinear function of t, the choice of the starting point of the second drying stage, i.e. 0, is critical for its proper performance. In many situations considerable evaporation can take place under firststagedryingconditionsandthetransitioncanalsobelong;thusingeneral,thisstarting point is not known and a different approach is needed. To obtain a more objective procedure, it was proposed by Brutsaert and Chen (1995) thatEquation(9.108)shouldberecastintermsofarelativetimet (t ),inwhicht is capillary rise and evaporation at the soil surface First stage Transition Time, (days) Fig.9.26 SketchofamethodtodeterminethetwostagesofdryingbymeansofEquation (9.110). (AfterBrutsaertandChen, 1995.) a time shift parameter. Then after fitting data of against t, in accordance with (9.108) one can derive and from the slope and intercept as sketched in Figure 9.26. In order to represent the cumulative evaporation as a function of in the range of validity of (9.108), the sketch illustrates that the starting point of the integration should be , = +t = = +t 0 r0 r 0 r0 variable starts its linear relation with . The cumulative evaporation after the onset of the desorptive regime is then (cid:24) ) (9.111) in which the subscript 2 indicates the second stage of drying. The value of , marking the beginning of the second stage, can be related to the value of the cumulative evaporation at (cid:23) the end of the first stage, or of the transition if there is one, say , as follows Thus (9.111) can also be expressed as (cid:24) (cid:24) As mentioned, (9.110) can be used as a regression equation with experimental data to estimate the values of the effective parameters and ; with a known or decided upon (cid:23) value of , Equation (9.113) allows the prediction of the cumulative evaporation after the onset of the second stage of drying. Conceptually, it can be seen that this procedure is in fact based on a time compression assumption, which is analogous with that used to describe rainfall infiltration after the infiltration and related unsaturated flows start of ponding, as described in Section 9.4.3. This means that the evaporation rate at the beginning of its desorptive phase is assumed to depend mostly on the water left in the soil profileandmuchlessonthepriorevaporationhistory.Thisassumptionisconsistentwiththe observationsofGardnerandHillel(1962)underconstantlaboratoryconditions,mentioned in Section 9.6.2. The effect of vegetation The two-stage concept with the desorption approach for the second stage was originally developed for evaporation from bare soil. However, it was concluded by Brutsaert and Chen (1995) that the desorption formulation can also be put to use in the description of daily evaporation from grassland and other similar types of short vegetation. From their analysis of experimental data obtained during several drying episodes in a natural tallgrass prairie area in Kansas during FIFE, the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (see Sellers al., 1992), the following sequence of events appears to take place. Initially after rain, both soil surfaceandvegetationevaporateatarategovernedbytheavailablesupplyonly;thiscanbe considered as a first stage of drying. (In this particular experimental setting, the first-stage behavior lasted as long as the volumetric soil moisture in the top 10 cm was in excess of 27%.) As the surface soil moisture becomes depleted below this first critical level, the watersupplyratetothesoilsurfacebecomesalimitingfactor,butatfirsttheplantrootsare still able to extract water from the soil at the energy-limiting rate. This may be referred to as the transition stage. In this stage the combined rate of evaporation from the surface and from the vegetation continues to decrease, until a second critical state of soil moisture is reached.(Intheexperimentthissecondcriticalstatewasreachedwhenthemoisturecontent went below about 17% and the vertical gradient started to exceed about 1.15% 5 cm.) At this point the vegetation becomes so stressed and relatively inactive that the drying takes place mainly from the soil surface; from that point on the daily evaporation proceeds like in a second stage of drying and it can be described simply by a desorption formulation, that is proportional to the square root of time. The transition period can last from several days to two weeks, depending on the soil moisture conditions and on the season.Thelongertransitionperiodswereobservedunderconditionsoflowernetradiation and of higher soil moisture content at depths in excess of 50 cm. These results were in contrast with the observations of relatively abrupt transitions for bare soil. Example 9.4. A monthlong drought period in tallgrass prairie The longest documented drying episode during the FIFE experiment occurred in the fall of 1987. After a major rainfall event on day 253 (September 10) and minor rainfalls on days258and259,norainfelluntilday288(October15).(SeealsoFigures2.22and4.12.) The recorded daily evaporation remained larger than the equilibrium evaporation (see Equation (4.30)) until day 258, when the near-surface soil moisture content was 0.303. The evaporation rate became equal to on day 259 and it dropped below it after that; therefore, day 260 was taken to be the start of the transition stage. In order to determine the end of the transition, the data were then analyzed as suggested by Equation (9.110), −271)×10−4,in andlinearregressionyielded,asshowninFigure9.27,(L E)istheaveragedailylatentheatfluxinWm−2 which(L andt thetimeasdayoftheyear.

The effective desorptivity derived from the slopes in Figures 9.27 and 9.28 is approximately 0.495 cm Although this value of was obtained for a grassy surface, it is of the same order as values reported for other studies with bare soil.

Clearly, this phenomenon will require further study. Diurnal variation by self-preservation approximation catchment hydrology the daily times scale is a common one; nevertheless, in many applicationsadailytimeresolutionistoocoarse,andtimestepsof30minto1harerequired. Further analysis of the same data observed over natural prairie, discussed in the previous section, also indicated (Brutsaert and Chen, 1996) that, while the total daily evaporation could be described with a dependency, this day-to-day evolution is modulated during thedaybytheavailableenergyatthesurface,thatisbythehourlyradiationinput.Moreover, during the daytime hours the surface energy budget often displays self-similarity or self- preservation, in the sense discussed in Section 4.3.4. This dual structure of the evaporative evolution during very dry conditions suggests that it can be described, by combining the desorptionparameterization(9.108)forthetotaldailyevaporation,orforanydimensionless counterpart(suchastheevaporativefractionEF,thePriestley–Taylorα andpossiblyothers), with the assumption of self-preservation as expressed in Equation (4.51). The combination of these two concepts yields the following evaporation rate at time of day , E De F F i 0d d 0 i references wheret isthetimeshiftparameter,andthesubscriptsdandirefertodailyandinstantaneous (sayinpractice,hourlyorhalf-hourly)variables,respectively; istheaveragefluxonday of some other flux term (beside the latent heat flux) in the surface energy budget, which can be assumed to exhibit a similar diurnal variation as the evaporation rate; is that flux at time of the same day. Thus Equation (9.114) contains two time scales, in units of days, and in units of hours. As illustrated in Figure 9.29, by assuming thisformulationwasabletoreproducedaytimehourlyfluxvaluesoveraperiodof2weeks during the second stage of drying already considered in Example 9.4. The approach was subsequently applied again and validated in a different experiment by Port´ e-Agel al. (2000),whoobtainedsimilarresults.Undertherightcircumstances,theapproachbasedon Equation (9.114) may be useful in the disaggregation of daily, or even weekly, evaporation into hourly values, when more complete information is lacking.

Additionally, the soil moisture is able to redistribute into a new equilibrium by early morning, involving hysteresis with drying from above during the day and wetting from below during the night, resulting in a distinct diurnal pattern of surface evaporation."}, {"question": "In the context of daily evaporation from bare soil, what is the relationship between cumulative evaporation and the square root of time, and how is it affected by the desorption formulation?", "answer": "The cumulative evaporation from bare soil can be described reasonably well by a desorption phenomenon, as given by Equation (9.108), with a linear relationship between cumulative evaporation and the square root of time. This relationship is supported by field studies, such as those by Black et al. (1969) and Parlange et al. (1992), which found that the desorption formulation can be used to describe daily evaporation from bare soil with a high degree of accuracy."}, {"question": "How does the presence of vegetation affect the two-stage concept of evaporation, and what are the implications for the desorption formulation?", "answer": "The presence of vegetation affects the two-stage concept of evaporation by introducing a transition stage, during which the plant roots are still able to extract water from the soil at the energy-limiting rate, before the soil surface becomes the dominant source of evaporation. This transition stage can last from several days to two weeks, depending on soil moisture conditions and season. The desorption formulation can still be used to describe the second stage of drying, but the effective desorptivity may be affected by the presence of vegetation."}, {"question": "In the context of the time compression approximation, how is the cumulative evaporation after the onset of the second stage of drying related to the desorption formulation, and what are the implications for predicting evaporation?", "answer": "The cumulative evaporation after the onset of the second stage of drying can be related to the desorption formulation through Equation (9.111), which allows for the prediction of cumulative evaporation after the onset of the second stage of drying. This equation is based on the time compression assumption, which assumes that the evaporation rate at the beginning of the desorptive phase depends mostly on the water left in the soil profile and much less on the prior evaporation history. This assumption is consistent with observations and can be used to predict evaporation with a high degree of accuracy."}, {"question": "Why does the diurnal variation of surface fluxes during thorough drying or severe drought of natural prairie exhibit self-similarity or self-preservation, and how can this be described using the desorption parameterization and the assumption of self-preservation?", "answer": "The diurnal variation of surface fluxes during thorough drying or severe drought of natural prairie exhibits self-similarity or self-preservation because the surface energy budget often displays self-similarity or self-preservation during the daytime hours. This can be described using the desorption parameterization, Equation (9.108), combined with the assumption of self-preservation, as expressed in Equation (4.51). The resulting formulation, Equation (9.114), contains two time scales, in units of days and hours, and can be used to reproduce daytime hourly flux values over a period of weeks during the second stage of drying."}, {"question": "In the context of the desorption formulation, how does the effective desorptivity relate to the soil type and vegetation cover, and what are the implications for evaporation prediction?", "answer": "The effective desorptivity derived from the desorption formulation relates to the soil type and vegetation cover, with values ranging from 0.350 cm d−1/2 for a black clay soil to 0.58 cm d−1/2 for a loam soil. The presence of vegetation can affect the effective desorptivity, but by the time evaporation from a grassy surface comes down to the second stage, the vegetation becomes quite inactive, and most of the drying takes place from the surface, as if it were bare. This similarity in effective desorptivity values for different soil types and vegetation covers suggests"}]}

However, understanding that infiltration rate decreases over time due to the soil's increasing saturation, the cumulative infiltration volume will increase at a decreasing rate. The units of this result would be volume per unit area, typically expressed in cm or mm."}, {"question": "In the scenario described, why does the rate of infiltration decrease over time, and what implications does this have for water content at saturation?", "answer": "The rate of infiltration decreases over time because as the soil becomes more saturated, its ability to absorb water decreases. This is due to the reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the soil as it approaches saturation. The implication of this decrease is that the water content at saturation (θs) is a critical parameter in determining the infiltration rate and the overall water balance in the soil. As the soil approaches saturation, the infiltration rate approaches zero, indicating that the soil can no longer absorb water at the same rate as when it was drier."}, {"question": "What is the depth of the wetting front after one minute, and how does this relate to the initial condition of the soil being dry?", "answer": "The depth of the wetting front after one minute can be found by substituting t=1 into the equation provided, but the specific equation for the depth of the wetting front is not directly given. However, understanding that the wetting front is the depth below the surface where the soil is just beginning to be wetted, it marks the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones. In an initially dry soil, the wetting front moves downward as infiltration occurs, indicating the progression of water into the soil profile."}, {"question": "How does the solution of the Richards equation provided account for the dynamics of water infiltration into the soil, and what assumptions are implicit in this solution?", "answer": "The solution provided, z = 2.90(1−S4), accounts for the dynamics of water infiltration by relating the depth of water penetration (z) to the degree of saturation (S). This implies that as the soil becomes more saturated, the depth of water penetration increases, but at a decreasing rate. Implicit in this solution are assumptions about the homogeneity of the soil, the uniform initial dryness, and the simplicity of the infiltration process, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios such as layered soils or variable infiltration rates."}, {"question": "In the context of unsaturated flow, why is the degree of saturation an important parameter, and how does it influence the infiltration process?", "answer": "The degree of saturation is a critical parameter in unsaturated flow because it directly affects the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, which in turn influences the infiltration rate. As the degree of saturation increases, the hydraulic conductivity increases, allowing for faster infiltration. However, as the soil approaches full saturation, the infiltration rate decreases due to the soil's reduced capacity to absorb additional water. This highlights the complex relationship between the degree of saturation, hydraulic conductivity, and infiltration rate, which are fundamental to understanding unsaturated flow phenomena."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the given solution for understanding and predicting infiltration and related unsaturated flows in various hydrological applications?", "answer": "The given solution has significant implications for understanding and predicting infiltration and related unsaturated flows. It provides a basis for modeling infiltration into dry soils, which is crucial for applications such as irrigation management, groundwater recharge assessments, and flood prediction. By understanding how infiltration rates change over time and with soil saturation, hydrologists can better predict water movement through the soil profile, aiding in the management of water resources and the mitigation of water-related hazards. However, the simplicity of the solution also underscores the need for more complex models that can account for the variability and heterogeneity of real-world soils and hydrological systems."}, {"question": "How does the water content at saturation (θs) relate to the infiltration process, and why is it a critical parameter in hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The water content at saturation (θs) is the maximum amount of water that the soil can hold. It is a critical parameter in hydrological modeling because it determines the upper limit of infiltration. As the soil approaches θs, the infiltration rate decreases, eventually reaching zero when the soil is fully saturated. θs varies by soil type and is influenced by factors such as soil texture"}]}

Evaporation from soil surfaces contributes significantly to the water vapor in the atmosphere, which eventually leads to precipitation. Therefore, understanding and accurately predicting evaporation rates are critical for modeling the hydrological cycle and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "In the context of the Diabloloam, what challenges might arise in calculating the maximal rate of evaporation due to variations in hydraulic conductivity?", "answer": "Calculating the maximal rate of evaporation in the Diabloloam might be challenging due to variations in hydraulic conductivity, which can significantly affect the rate of capillary rise and subsequent evaporation.

After the precipitation or other input has ceased for some time, the entire streamflow can be assumed to consist of the cumulative outflow from all upstream phreatic aquifers. The prediction of base flow is of some practical importance because it is the rate of flow, that a given river basin can sustain in the absence of precipitation and in the absence of artificial storage works. Accordingly, this type of flow is variously known as flow, flow, base drought low and or runoff. In engineering such flows have been studied flow sustained fair-weather in connection with problems of water supply and water quality in rivers during drought periods, and general basin and agricultural drainage. During, and in response to, precipitation or snowmelt, the different pathways and the detailed mechanisms, by which water reaches the stream, are more complex than during drought flow episodes. Still, as will be seen in Chapter 11, it is generally agreed that also storm runoff from natural basins with vegetation is largely supplied into the streams by subsurface transport.

{"paragraph": "10.1.1 General formulation A typical cross section of an unconfined aquifer, whose water flows into the adjoining stream, is sketched in Figure 10.1. As this flow system is usually relatively shallow and exposed to the atmosphere through a partly saturated soil moisture zone, the water pressures and effective stresses are rarely very large, so that the water and the solid matrix can be assumed to be incompressible (see Brutsaert and El-Kadi, 1984, 1986). Therefore, if the material can be assumed to be effectively isotropic, the flow, which involves combined saturated and partly saturated conditions, is in principle governed by flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer Soil surface Impermeable layer Fig.10.1 Sketchofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedriparianaquifer.WTreferstothewatertable,whichisthe locuswherethewaterpressureisatmospheric;abovetheWTthesoilispartlysaturated.Thedivideis assumedtobethecatchmentboundary. =(z + /γ inwhichh )isthehydraulichead,z theverticalcoordinate,k thehydraulic conductivity and the water content of the aquifer. The boundary conditions can be prescribed in broad terms as follows. At the bedrock or impermeable bed underlying the aquifer and at the catchment divide, the flux is usually parallel to the boundary, or if is the coordinate normal to the boundary, 0. At the ground surface, the specific flux across the boundary can be given as the evaporation E, as the infiltration rate , or as a combination of both; for simplicity, however, in the analysis of base flow it is often assumed to be zero, so that here also 0.

A general solution of this problem is obviously unattainable. Nevertheless, some crucial features of the flow phenomena can be brought out by the solution of special cases and simplified geometries. One common simplification consists of the adoption of “effective” parameter functions; the basic concept was introduced in Section 1.4.3. In brief, it is based on the groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.2 Schematicrepresentationofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedriparianaquifer,lyingonahorizontal impermeablelayer.Theoriginofthecoordinatesistakenatthestream(x 0)andatthe impermeablelayer(z Dc D 0); isthewaterdepthintheadjoiningstream, istheaquiferthickness, and istheaquiferbreadth,thatisthedistancefromthestreamtothedivide.Thewatertable(WT), isthelocuswherethewaterpressure isatmospheric,or 0.AbovetheWTthesoilispartly saturated,andthewaterpressuresmallerthanatmospheric;belowtheWTthewaterpressureis largerthanatmospheric. assumption that it is possible to define (or imagine) a spatially uniform model aquifer, with effective parameter functions and which, upon solution of Equation (10.1) with appropriate boundary conditions, produces the same flow charac- teristics of interest, as the real spatially variable prototype aquifer. A second simplifi- cation is based on the observation that the vertical dimensions of unconfined riparian aquifers tend to be much smaller than their horizontal extent. This has led to the assump- tion that the boundary conditions of real aquifers are rarely very different from those of a two-dimensional model aquifer of rectangular cross section; for purposes of flow analysis, the aquifer depicted in Figure 10.1 can thus be represented schematically as shown in Figure 10.2.

{"paragraph": "10.1.3 A few features of combined saturated–unsaturated flow Unsteady flow formulation Some results of a numerical solution of Equation (10.1) were presented by Verma and Brutsaert (1970; 1971b) for the two-dimensional case of outflow from a horizontal unconfined aquifer with a rectangular cross section, after the cessation of recharge; this situation is illustrated in Figure 10.2. The soil water characteristic was assumed to be given by Equation (8.15) and the hydraulic conductivity by Equation (8.36). With the effectivesaturation definedinEquation(8.6),theboundaryconditionsforthisproblem can be specified as follows = = 1.0 = ≤ ≤ h D S x z D = = 1.0 = ≤ = h z S x D z h = = = ≤ ≤ = = = ≤ ≤ = = ≤ ≤ = 0 0 0 z 0 = = ≤ ≤ = The first boundary condition is a result of the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the stream. At the seepage surface the pressure is zero (i.e. atmospheric) and the hydraulic head is equal to the height z, as indicated in the second condition. Above the seepage surface the water pressure is negative, and because no outflow is physically possible unless the pressure is at least atmospheric, this surface acts as an impermeable boundary as indicated in the third of (10.2). The boundary conditions given by the fourth and fifth of (10.2) express the no-flow or impermeable boundaries of the aquifer at the divide and at the underlying bed rock. As it is assumed that there is no evaporation or recharge, the ground surface acts like an impermeable boundary after the drainage starts, as indicated inthelastcondition;however,thisconditionatthegroundsurfacecanbereadilyreplaced by the evaporative flux or recharge rate, if it is known. The initial conditions, for 0, can be assumed to be those of a fully saturated aquifer, in which the water table coincides with the ground surface. This situation is groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.3 Initialstatefortheunconfinedriparianaquifer,shownin Figure10.2.Thewatertable(WT)is assumedtobeatthesoilsurfaceandtheentireaquiferissaturated. formulated as S x B z D h D x B z D = = 1.0,whichisassumedtobeaneffectivehydraulicconductivitythat Sincek at isconstantoverthewholeflowdomain,Equation(10.1)reducestotheLaplaceequation, as indicated in Equation (10.3). This initial state of the aquifer is shown in Figure 10.3. Similarity criteria By scaling the variables, it can readily be seen, that the only relevant (dimensionless) thegeometryoftheflow,viz. and geometry, viz. (aD). Because in Equation (8.15) can be considered a measure of thethicknessofthecapillaryfringe,(aD)−1 expressestherelativeimportanceofcapillarity, and thus of the partly saturated flow zone, with respect to the vertical dimensions of the aquifer. Results of some example calculations for and are shown in Figure 10.4, with 3, and 3 in 8,(aD)−1 = = 0.36, = 1.5 Figure 10.5, and with and in Figure 10.6. The values of theparameters(mainly(aD)−1 andb)for Figures10.4and10.6couldrepresent,forexam- ple, a loam soil in an aquifer of approximately 3 m depth; those of Figure 10.5 a somewhat coarser material in an aquifer of roughly the same depth. These calculations show that the water table tends to fall faster for higher values of and for smaller values of b; but the value of does not appear to affect this very much. This illustrates that in real situations where capillary effects are important, it may be deceiving to use the water table as an upper boundary of the flow domain, because a large amount of water may be left in the unsaturated zone above the water table. It can also be observed that for large values of and after large the lines of equal hydraulic head are close to horizontal outside the zone of saturation, whereas they are more nearly vertical within this zone. This refraction phenomenon is mainly the result of the fact that the upper boundary of the saturated zone constitutes a boundary between a zone of high and a zone of low conductivity. The results of these numerical experiments can be used to derive similarity criteria to determine different regimes of flow in unconfined aquifers by comparing them with the results of special solutions for each of these regimes (Verma and Brutsaert, 1971a, b). In principle, all three parameters n, and b which involve soil characteristics, should flow in an unconfined riparian aquifer (a) t+ = 0.013 (b) t+ = 0.518 (d) t+ = 4.762 (c) t+ = 2.274 Fig.10.4 Successivepositionsofthewatertable(dashedline)andoflinesofequalhydraulichead 1.0,(aD)−1 (solidlines),inanaquiferwith andBrutsaert,1970.) represent some aspect of the transport in the partly saturated flow zone.

This suggests that in nature, where the values of are usually much larger than the values considered here, the effect of capillarity is likely to be even more pronounced than these numerical results groundwater outflow and base flow (a) = 0.013 (b) = 0.518 (c) = 2.274 (d) = 4.762 1.0,(aD)−1 Dc+ n 3andb Fig.10.5 SameasFigure10.4foranaquiferwith 3.

In any event, these results show that it is mainly that can be used to determine whether or not the capillary flow above the water table is important. Equation (8.15), from which the parameter was obtained for these numerical exper- iments, may not always be the optimal way to parameterize the soil-water characteristic. Therefore, it is useful to broaden this criterion by defining a capillary zone number Ca (10.4) in which is a characteristic suction (negative pressure) required to reduce the degree of saturation of the soil to a certain fraction. This dimensionless quantity Ca can be imple- mented with the other expressions presented in Section 8.2.4 as well.

As already hinted in the second of(10.13), which describes theseepagesurface,thetimevariableenterstheproblemthroughtheconditionatthefree surface, which constitutes the moving upper boundary. Before deriving this free surface condition, it is necessary to introduce the concept of the drainable porosity. Drainable porosity As the water table passes a point, say in the case of drainage when it is falling, the pores do not empty immediately, but the water is retained by capillarity and other mechanisms mentioned in Section 8.2.2; it is only when the water pressure decreases further, i.e. with increasing suction, as illustrated in Figures 8.3–8.6, that water drains from the pores. In the free surface approximation, the reality of this gradual transition is replaced by the assumption of the porosity, . This drainable porosity, which is also called drainable n the or the yield, can be defined as the volume of water per unit effective porosity specific volume of porous material, that is released or imbibed, as the free surface passes a given point. In general, the amount of water present in the pores at a point depends on the local water pressure. From this it follows that the drainable porosity must depend on the prevailingwaterpressuredistributionabovethewatertableandthereforeonthenatureof theflowsituation.Figure10.12furtherillustrateshowtheconceptcanbeinterpretedwith referencetothesoilwatercharacteristic.Itcanbeseenthatn dependsonthevalueofthe maximum suction in the soil column above the water table; because )max changes with time during unsteady flow, in principle may also be time dependent to some free surface flow extent. As shown, the soil water characteristic curve in Figure 10.12 describes drainage; obviously, consideration of repeated draining and wetting cycles with hysteresis would complicate the matter even more. This means that the drainable porosity cannot be a unique physical property of a given porous material, and that it must be considered as a mere parameter that is to be adjusted and calibrated depending on the flow problem. This is its main limitation, which should be kept in mind in practical applications of the free surface approach in flow in porous media. But if this limitation is kept in mind, the concept can yield useful results in the parameterization of groundwater flow processes at the field and catchment scales. Free surface condition In principle, the condition at the free surface in a porous material is again Equation (5.1) as presented in Chapter 5. If the function 0 describing the free surface is taken as = = [η( = η the reference level 0, this can be written as −w + = = η 0 at (10.14) in which, as before, and represent the x- and z-components of the true fluid velocity, which is also that of the free surface. Thevelocityofafluidisitsvolumetricrateofflowperunitcross-sectionalareaoccupied by this fluid. Because the specific flux in Darcy’s equation is the volumetric flow rate per unit cross-sectional area of total or bulk porous material, it does not represent the true velocity of the fluid particles (cf. Section 8.3.1). Rather, with the assumption of a drainable porosity, the actual velocity of the fluid particles must be taken as ). Therefore, with (q ) and (q ) as the x- and z-components of the velocity of the fluid and also of the free surface, Equation (10.14) becomes, in terms of the Darcy flux, −q +n = = η 0 at (10.15) With Darcy’s law one obtains finally ∂η ∂h ∂η ∂h = − = η = at (10.16) ∂t ∂x ∂x ∂z There is also a second way of implementing Equation (5.1) in a porous material to formulate the condition at the free surface. If the adopted free surface function is ∂h ∂h ∂h 0 at (10.17) ∂x ∂z ∂t from which one obtains the free surface condition, as an alternative to Equation (10.16), ∂h ∂h 2 ∂h 2 ∂h = + − = η = at (10.18) ∂t ∂x ∂z ∂z Either (10.16) or (10.18) can be used in the solution of the problem; the choice depends usually on the specific mathematical aspects to be investigated. groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.13 Sketchillustratingthe applicationofEquation water table (10.16)tocalculatethe rateofdrawdownofthe watertable(WT),when treatedasafree surface.The equipotentialsarelines equipotential ofconstanthydraulic h.(AfterKirkham andGaskell,1951.) streamline equipotential Example 10.1.

Consideration of hysteresis would require accounting for the different drainage and imbibition curves, leading to a more complex relationship between the drainable porosity and the prevailing water pressure distribution.

{"paragraph": "10.3.1 General formulation The governing differential equations for this approach can be derived by combining the continuity equation with Darcy’s law adjusted for the hydraulic assumptions. Adjustment of Darcy’s law The main assumption is essentially the same as that commonly made for open channel flow. It is that the curvature of the streamlines is very small, so that the pressure distri- bution is practically hydrostatic in the direction normal to the impermeable bed. For the two-dimensional cross section of the aquifer shown in Figure 10.15, Equation (5.5) is directly applicable and can be rewritten as + γ cosα = 0 (10.23) inwhichα istheslopeangleoftheunderlyingimpermeablelayer,and isthecoordinate normal to that layer.

For a fluid of constant density the hydraulic head is Equation (8.18) = ζ + /γ or in the present notation . With (10.25) the hydraulic gradient becomes = cosα + sinα Hence, under the assumption of hydraulic flow, Darcy’s equation yields the specific flux (cid:2) (cid:3) = −k cosα + sinα which, as observed below Equation (10.25), is a constant in any given cross section normal to the underlying bed at a distance from the origin. A derivation of (10.27) was in both instances the approach differed somewhat from the one given here. groundwater outflow and base flow Equation of continuity Because is a constant along z, it is identical with the average, and the continuity equation(5.13)derivedforfreesurfaceopenchannelflowisalsodirectlyapplicablehere. In (5.13) the term representing the displacement rate of the free surface becomes in the present notation. Because this is an actual velocity of the interface, the average velocity in (5.13) must be replaced here by the “true” velocity in the porous material (q ); similarly, the lateral inflow must be replaced by a true recharge velocity ), where is the recharge rate, representing a source term as a volumetric flux per unit ground surface area of porous material. Thus one obtains (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 (10.28) With (10.27) this assumes the form ∂η ∂ ∂η ∂η = cosα η + sinα + ∂t ∂x ∂x ∂x in which it is assumed, as is commonly done, that and are constant or can be treated as effective parameters. In the absence of lateral inflow and for a horizontal impermeable layer, Equation (10.29) becomes (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂t ∂x ∂x Both (10.29) and (10.30) are forms of what is usually referred to as the Boussinesq equation. To repeat, the Boussinesq equation is based on the following assumptions. (i) The effect of unsaturated flow above the water table is negligible and it can be parameterized by an effective porosity or specific yield ; this is also the basis of the free surface approach (i.e. the first approximation). (ii) The pressure distribution in the direction normal to the bed is hydrostatic, which leads to (10.27), which is the basis of the hydraulic approach (i.e the second approximation). The derivation of Equations (10.29) and (10.30) is presented here for a two- dimensional cross section of an unconfined aquifer. It is straightforward to consider the more general case of three-dimensional flow, with as the coordinate pointing up the slope along the impermeable bed, and as the horizontal lateral or span-wise coor- dinate, to obtain a more general form of the Boussinesq equation, namely = cosα η + sinα + η + Mathematically,Equation(10.31)canbecharacterizedasanonlinearadvectivediffusion equation, with a variable (i.e. a function of and anisotropic hydraulic (groundwater) = ηcosα/n = η/n diffusivity,whosetwoprincipalcomponentsare and , hx 0 e hy 0 e = −k sinα/n and with a hydraulic (groundwater) advectivity .

{"paragraph": "10.3.2 Steady flow described with hydraulic theory Over the years hydraulic groundwater theory has been a powerful tool to solve a large number of important practical problems under steady state conditions. The main reason for its wide use is that under steady state conditions the Boussinesq equation becomes linear in which greatly simplifies the mathematical analysis. For instance, under conditions of steady flow over a horizontal bed and in the absence of lateral inflow, Equation (10.31) reduces to ∂2η2 ∂2η2 0 (10.32) This is Laplace’s equation in for which many solution methods are available. More- over,becausetheproblemislinear,knownsolutionsforη2 obtainedforrelativelysimple boundary conditions can be extended to more complicated situations by the application of image methods and other methods of superposition. Two examples of steady aquifer outflow are presented in what follows. Steady outflow resulting from a uniform precipitation Under steady conditions and for an aquifer cross section with horizontal bed, as shown in Figure 10.16, one can write Equation (10.29) as (cid:2) (cid:3) where is a constant recharge rate; this is usually taken as a climatological average rainfall for design purposes, but it may also represent irrigation or a negative rate of groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.17 Examplesofscaledwatertable heightη/B asafunctionofscaled distance fromthe drainagechannelfordifferent 0.3 valuesofthescaledrechargerate andwaterlevel intheopenchannel, calculatedwithEquation (10.37)for theconditionsshowninFigure 10.16.Curve1represents = 0.1and = 0.1;curves2 and3represent = 0.1and0.01,respectively. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Eachcurveisaquarterellipse. evaporation from the water table or seepage through the bed, or any combination of several of these rates. The following boundary conditions is , and on account of (10.27) that the divide represents an impermeable boundary. Integrating (10.33) twice, one obtains for the height of the water table η2 = − + (2Bx (10.35) Actually,thisresultcanalsobederiveddirectlywithoutformalrecoursetotheBoussinesq equation, by simply observing that at any point according to (10.27) the rate of flow Equation (10.35) can be generalized, to facilitate comparison with experimental results and other theoretical approaches, by scaling the variables as follows and (10.36) This transforms (10.35) into 2x+ (10.37) This result is illustrated in Figure 10.17 for a few examples. Application of Equation (10.35) to B, where the water table has its maximal height , yields immediately (cid:12) (cid:13) Equation (10.38) was originally intended as a design equation, to determine the spacing (2B) of drainage ditches or underground pipe drainage systems of agricultural lands; hydraulic groundwater theory Fig.10.18 Schematicrepresentationofthecrosssectionofanunconfinedaquifer,lyingonahorizontal impermeablelayerbetweentwoopenchannelswithconstantwaterlevels.Ifthewatertable(WT)is assumedtobeafreesurface,theresultingsteadyflowrateq betweenthetwochannelsisgivenexactly bytheDupuitformula(10.43).ThesolidcurverepresentsthetrueWTwithaseepagesurfaceandthe dashedcurvetheWTobtainedwiththehydraulicapproach. in fact, with a number of subsequent improvements it still provides the basis for many of the soil drainage design procedures in use today. In order to apply it in its original form, the variables on the right-hand side of Equation (10.38) must be known or decided upon. Thus is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, is taken as the average rate of precipitation or other input during the period when drainage is needed most, is the depth of the water in the drainage channel or, to a first approximation, the height of the drainage pipe above the impermeable layer, and is the main design vari- able, namely the maximal allowable height of the water table above the impermeable Equation (10.38) has a long history. It is now often referred to as the ellipse equation, on account of the shape of the water table given by Equation (10.35) (see Figure 10.17). ItwasprobablyfirstderivedbyA.ColdinginDenmarkbefore1872forthecase 0, afterhebecameawareofearlierexperimentalresultspublishedin1859byS.C.Delacroix in France; interestingly, he also recommended a 10% reduction of any value obtained with Equation (10.38), to make it agree better with these experimental data. Hooghoudt (1937), who knew indirectly of Colding’s result through the work of others, was proba- adjusted it to make it more suitable for drainage with pipes. A detailed history of the equation and its more recent derivatives has been presented by VanderPloeg al. Steady flow between two parallel channels without precipitation Inthisproblem,asshowninFigure10.18,theflowintheunconfinedaquiferisdescribed by the one-dimensional Laplace equation 0 (10.39) The boundary conditions are groundwater outflow and base flow where and are the depths in the two channels. Integrating (10.39) once, one where is an integration constant. Comparison with Equation (10.27) for a horizontal = −q/k = (ηq bed shows immediately that , in which ). The variable is the rate of flow in the aquifer between the two channels per unit length of channel Becausetheflowissteady,inthepresentsituationq isaconstant,thatis,independentofx. A second integration, with the first of (10.40), yields the position of the free surface η2 = − + Application of the second of (10.40) yields the rate of flow between the two channels, in terms of the hydraulic conductivity and the known water levels in the two channels, or (cid:12) (cid:13) Again, the negative sign in Equation (10.43) merely indicates that the flow is taking place in the minus direction. Equation (10.43) is known as the Dupuit formula (see also Dupuit, 1863, p. 236). This result is of considerable theoretical interest, because it can be shown to be exact. In other words, even though in the derivation of (10.43) use is made of the hydraulic assumptions, it has the same form as the solution for the same free surface problem, obtained when no use is made of the hydraulic assumptions. The fact that, in some cases, it produces the exact result, suggests that the hydraulic approach can be a powerful and reliable tool in the derivation of the groundwater flow rates. This has been confirmed in other instances as well. However, it is now also known thatthehydraulicapproachisnotasaccurateinthepredictionofthegeometryofthefree surface. One obvious reason for this is that an inherently two-dimensional flow pattern is being described by a one-dimensional formulation. This precludes then, for example, the inclusion of a seepage surface in the boundary conditions, as was done in the second of (10.13). In hydraulic groundwater theory, there is no way to include the existence of a seepage surface and the first two of (10.13) must of necessity be combined into one Exactness of the Dupuit formula The proof proceeds as follows, for the situation sketched in Figure 10.18. Without consid- eration of the hydraulic approximation, the rate of flow through a vertical section at any point between the two open channels is given by Recall that and application of Leibniz’s formula (see Appendix, Equation (A2)) therefore allows (10.44) to be rewritten as hydraulic groundwater theory Since defines the free surface, (10.45) can be integrated to yield The constant C can be determined by applying the boundary condition at 0, where for 0 and for (The lower part of this boundary h D z D h z D z c1 c1 c1 conditiondescribesthehydrostaticconditionsandconstanthydraulicheadinthecanal,and the higher part the seepage surface; thus this condition differs from the first of (10.40), i.e. thecorrespondingconditionofthehydraulicapproach,whichisincapableofincorporating a seepage surface.)

Theboundaryconditions,describingflowfromsuchaninfinitelywide,initiallysaturated aquifer into an empty channel, can be formulated as Similarity considerations Like in the sorption problem in Section 9.2, the nature of the semi-infinite flow domain and these boundary conditions imply a certain symmetry; because the aquifer must be empty after a very long time of drainage, the water level for is the same as at 0 for all times; similarly, very far from the channel, i.e. for the water will not “feel” the effect of the drainage and will remain at the original level it had at 0. groundwater outflow and base flow Hence, Boltzmann’s transform, i.e. can be used here as well. As will be shown next, this greatly simplifies the solution. In the manner shown in Equations (9.12), the Boltzmann transformation (10.54) allows the reduction of the Boussinesq equation (10.30) to the following ordinary differential equation (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 (10.55) dφ dφ dφ The boundary conditions (10.53) now become η = φ → ∞ Regardless of the method used, the solution of (10.55) with (10.56) is of the form The cumulative outflow volume from the aquifer at 0 is φ = φ(η) given by Equation (10.52). Thus, once the solution is known, in light of the Boltzmann transform, this outflow volume becomes ∀ =t φ(η)dη Because the integral in (10.57) is a constant, for conciseness of notation, the outflow volume can be expressed in terms of the hydraulic desorptivity, defined as = φ(η)dη The rate of outflow from the aquifer at 0, that is can now be written This can probably serve as a more tangible and practical definition of the desorptivity than (10.58). Note that the outflow rate can also be obtained by applying the hydraulic η = η(x,t), solution the result should be the same as that obtained with (10.59) and (10.58). Before any solutions are discussed in detail, some interesting features of the hydraulic desorptivity canbederivedfromadditionalsimilarityconsiderations.Itstandstoreason that the water table height should be normalized with its initial value D; insertion of this normalized depth into Equation (10.55) reveals then immediately the dimensionless form of Thus the problem can be cast in terms of the following scaled variables η = (η/D) hydraulic groundwater theory In terms of these dimensionless variables, the desorptivity (10.58) can now be written as a(k (10.61) In Equation (10.61) represents the definite integral which is a dimensionless constant, and thus simply a number whose value depends on the solution. To summarize, this brief analysis has shown how, except for a constant a, the exact obtainedbyusingsimilarity,thatisalmostbyinspection,withoutactuallyderivingthesolu- tion. Two types of similarity were invoked here. The first, Boltzmann’s transform, which results from the nature of the boundary conditions, involves a combination of the indepen- dent variables; it states that the dependency of on is similar to its dependency on The second type of similarity involves the scaling of the variables to make the formulation dimensionless, and thus universally applicable to any aquifer, with any dimensions and consisting of any type of porous material. Solutions Several solutions of this problem have been derived. Polubarinova-Kochina (1952, p. 507) wasabletoobtainasolution,bytransformingBoussinesq’sEquation(10.30)totheBlasius equation for the viscous boundary layer. From her result it can be shown that = 0.66412 but the details of the derivation are beyond the present scope. A similar but slightly more accurate procedure was later used by Hogarth and Parlange (1999). There are also several approximate solutions available, that while less accurate, still yield values of close to (10.63). One such solution, based on an approximation of Equation (10.30) by successive steady states, was proposed in 1886 by K. E. Lembke (cited by Polubarinova-Kochina, 1952,p.573);thisassumptioncanbeshowntoleadtoa Equation(10.63).Incidentally,theassumptionofsuccessivesteadystatesisequivalentwith thequasi-steadyapproach,whichwasusedinthesolutionofthehorizontalinfiltrationprob- lem by Parlange (1971). A second approximate solution can be obtained by linearization; in1947J.H.Edelman(citedbyKraijenhoff,1966)proposeditsusetodescribefreesurface (4p/π)1/2, groundwater flow; this solution yields a in which is a parameter used to compensate for the approximation due to the linearization and discussed further in Section 10.4. Comparison with Equation (10.63) shows that the linear solution can produce the same result as the exact outflow rate, provided 0.3465. Outflow rate The rate of outflow from the aquifer into the adjacent stream or some other type of open water body is the main item of interest in catchment hydrology; on the basis of simple similarity, it was already shown to be given by Equation (10.59), in which was defined as a constant but unspecified hydraulic desorptivity.

{"paragraph": "10.3.5 Long-time outflow behavior As formulated in Equation (10.50), the third condition describes an initially saturated aquiferovertheentirewidthoftheaquifer,i.e.for0 B.Boussinesq(1904)showed how, by relaxing this condition and by specifying the initial value of only at B, it becomes possible to obtain an exact solution of (10.30). Thus instead of (10.50), the relaxed boundary conditions are the following Aswillbeshownbelow,Boussinesq’smethodofsolutionimplicitlyrequirestheassump- tionofself-preservationofthex-dependencyofthewatertableheightη,sothattheshape of the water table remains the same with time. This water table shape is not arbitrary, but it results from the solution. As illustrated in Figure 10.21, that solution produces a water table that is curvilinear throughout the drainage process, from the beginning at 0 to the end when the outflow finally ceases. Normally, an initially saturated aquifer (cf. the third of (10.50)) will exhibit this kind of shape only after drainage has proceeded for some time; it is for this reason that the solution obtained in what follows is referred to as a long-time solution. Similarity considerations As was the case for the short-time solution, useful insight can be gained by making the formulation dimensionless. Again, it is reasonable to normalize the length variables hydraulic groundwater theory and with their respective maximal values and B, as suggested by the boundary conditions (10.65). Insertion of these normalized variables in the governing differential equation (10.30) yields then the appropriate scaling of the time variable. Thus one ends up with the following scaled variables These dimensionless variables allow the Boussinesq equation (10.30) to be simplified as (cid:2) (cid:3) and the boundary conditions (10.65) as = = ≥ (10.68) This problem can be solved by separation of variables, that is, by assuming that the η = η ,t+) solution +(x+ is a product of two functions, one dependent only on and one dependent only on t+, or Substitution of (10.69) into (10.67) produces (cid:2) (cid:3) dt+ F dx+ dx+ in which must be constant; since and are independent of each other, the and C x t F F dependent parts of Equation (10.70) can only be equal to each other if they are constant.

The outflow rate from the aquifer, Equation (10.51), can be written in terms of the dimensionless variables defined in (10.66) as (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) D2/B),definingadimen- Observethatthissuggeststhattheoutflowratebescaledwith(k sionless outflow rate With the solution (10.72) and putting (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15) one obtains in dimensionless form (1+at+)2 In (10.76) and are dimensionless constants, whose values depend on the solution of (10.70) for F(x+).

Equation (10.87) then becomes ∂η η ∂2η Equation (10.88) is in the form of the standard diffusion equation, with a constant hydraulic (groundwater) diffusivity In a similar way, the more general form (Equation (10.31)) of the Boussinesq equation can be linearized to produce (cid:2) (cid:3) ∂η η ∂2η ∂2η sinα ∂η = cosα + + + ∂t ∂x2 ∂y2 ∂x in which, as before, is the slope of the underlying impermeable bed.

The linearization of the Boussinesq equation results in a constant hydraulic diffusivity, which simplifies the modeling process but may not always accurately represent the physical system, especially in cases where the aquifer properties vary significantly.

{"paragraph": "10.4.2 Flow from a horizontal aquifer Consider again the standard case of outflow from an initially saturated aquifer, after the cessation of rainfall or recharge, as described by boundary conditions (10.50). In the linearized system the governing differential equation is now (10.88). Similarity considerations As before in (10.66), it is convenient to scale the variables. The form of (10.88) and of (10.50) suggest that this be done as follows These scaled variables allow the differential equation (10.88) to be written as Similarly, the boundary conditions (10.50) can be expressed in terms of the scaled variables as follows = = ≥ (10.96) η = ≤ ≤ = linearized hydraulic groundwater theory Solution Separation of variables in the form of a product solution like (10.69), and substitution in (10.95) produce in this case where is a constant for the same reason as in (10.70), which is positive because and must always remain finite; this can be seen from the solution for the t+-dependent part of (10.97), that is = exp(−C t+) (10.98) The solution of the differential equation for in (10.97) produces (cid:18) (cid:18) 1 3 1 4 1 where and are constants.

It was probably not until the work of Dumm (1954) and Kraijenhoff (1958) that the full series was used in hydrology. increase rapidly as 1, 9, 25, . . . Moreover, the amplitudes of the sine functions in the series 1/3, 1/5, decrease as 1, . . . These are the two features which made Boussinesq observe, that with time only the first term in the series survives. Thus the water table (10.105) gradually assumes the shape of the first sine function, and the long-time linear solution is the fundamental harmonic (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:6) πx+ −π2t+ sin exp (10.107) linearized hydraulic groundwater theory Comparison between the first and second term in the series of (10.105) shows that this long-time solution can be assumed to be valid when where the error drops well below 1%.

This result is illustrated in Figure 10.23. In terms of the original variables, after trans- formation with (10.94), the rate of outflow from the unconfined aquifer (10.112) can be written as (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n − 1)2π2k η = −2k η − (D )B exp (10.113) n=1,2,...

Indeed, as pointed out by Kraijenhoff (1958), it represents in fact the unit response, that is the Green’s function for the linear hydraulic aquifer. The unit input applied over the whole aquifer (in two dimensions, that is per unit length of stream channel or per unit span), causing this response, is [n (D per unit area of − )]δ(t). ground surface this is [n (D Therefore, the response of a linearized hydraulic aquifer to a delta function input, that is the unit response, from (10.113), is (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2k η (n exp (10.117) n=1,2,... Arbitrary inputs into the aquifer by precipitation, snowmelt, etc., or negative inputs by evaporation at the surface, leakage through the impermeable bed, etc., can be dealt with by simple convolution (see Appendix). Thus if this input per unit horizontal area is I(t), with dimensions applied uniformly over the aquifer, i.e. independently of x, the resulting outflow rate at 0 is (10.118) where u(t) is given by (10.117) and is the memory inherent or assigned to the flow system. It should be noted that in a similar way, on account of the assumed linearity of the system, the solution for the position of the water table, namely (10.106), can in principle alsoserveasthebasisforaunitresponsefunctionresultingfromadeltafunctioninput;this linearized hydraulic groundwater theory can then be used to predict the evolution of the water table resulting from arbitrary inputs (e.g. steady rainfall as in the following example) by convolution, i.e. with the analog of (10.118)appliedtoη insteadofq.However,asnotedearlier,thepositionofthewatertable in hydraulic groundwater theory is quite unreliable, and need therefore not be of further concern here. Example 10.2 The application of (10.118) can be readily illustrated by considering the case of a constant inputofunitintensity I(t) .Theresultingoutflowratebecomessteadywhenthisinput has been applied for a very long time.

Example 10.3 The next case to be considered is the outflow rate some time after a steady input has ceased. This represents the outflow rate from the aquifer, with the initial shape of the water tablegivenby(10.37)resultingfromasteadyinfiltration,ratherthanbythethirdof(10.50) describing fully saturated conditions. This case is of practical interest, as the steady input mayrepresentprolongedrainfallorirrigation.Indeed,theonsetofdrainageafterprolonged rainfall or irrigation, which does not fully saturate the aquifer, is a common occurrence in humid regions. If 0 is the time when the steady input stops, the input I(t) can be formulated as follows = −∞ < < (10.122) Thus (10.118) can be written as (cid:8) (cid:8) u(t 0 u(t (10.123) groundwater outflow and base flow Scaledoutflowhydrographq+ q+(t+)from Fig.10.24 alinearizedhydraulicaquiferintoan adjoiningopenwaterbody(heavyline)as givenby(10.126),andthefirstterminthe seriesexpansion(thinstraightline).Herethe outflowrateisscaledwiththeinitialoutflow rateq BIc;thisinitialoutflowrateresults Ic priortot+ fromasteadyinput 0,as describedinExample10.3. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Thesecondtermontherightyieldszero;therefore,uponintegrationofthefirsttermonthe right of (10.123) with (10.117), one can write c 0 0 0 0 (2n 4n 4n (10.124) or, finally, after application of the limits of integration, (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2k η exp (10.125) At 0, when the steady input ceases, this solution yields the initial condition (10.121), as it should. A feature worth noting in (10.125) is that it converges much more quickly to the first term in the series than (10.113), on which the unit response (10.117) is based. This rapid disappearance of the higher-order terms in (10.125) is best illustrated by expressing it in dimensionless form. By scaling the outflow rate with the initial flow rate, so that in the present case ), (10.125) becomes (cid:2) (cid:3) −(2n −1)2π2t+ exp (10.126) be seen that only the first term survives, when this is in contrast with (10.112), illustrated in Figure 10.23 where the same can be seen to occur only for The difference between these two cases stems from the different initial condition. For (10.112) the aquifer is assumed to be initially fully saturated, whereas for (10.126), the water table is initially assumed to be described by the linearized version of (10.35). Example 10.4 Consider now the outflow resulting from rainfall as an arbitrary input function of time P(t).Inprinciplethereshouldbenoproblemincarryingouttheconvolutionintegration, linearized hydraulic groundwater theory analytically or numerically. However, rainfall data are usually recorded as bar graphs, that is as constant values over finite time intervals, hourly or daily.

{"paragraph": "10.4.3 Flow from a hillslope aquifer Again, to derive the unit response function, it is convenient to consider the problem of outflow from an initially saturated aquifer (Figure 10.26). While the aquifer empties out, there is no surface recharge, so that the differential equation governing this phenomenon is (10.90) with 0. In the case of a sloping aquifer, the total flow rate at any distance from the channel can be determined from (10.26); after linearization, this is (cid:2) (cid:3) η) = −k η cosα + sinαη (q (10.132) Therefore, the boundary condition at the divide, where , is not simply the second of (10.50), but it must be adjusted to simulate the impermeable barrier in accordance linearized hydraulic groundwater theory with (10.132). Moreover, in hilly terrain, torrential streams tend to be shallow, and they usually have no effect on the groundwater flow in the adjoining hillslopes, so that it is safe to assume that 0. Hence, instead of (10.50), for an initially saturated sloping aquifer the boundary conditions can be formulated as follows η = ≤ ≤ = Forthepresenttwo-dimensionalcaseofflowdowntheslope,andintheabsenceoflateral can be written as ∂η η cosα ∂2η sinα ∂η (10.134) ∂t ∂x2 ∂x Notice again that this equation is in the form of the linear advective diffusion equation, which was already encountered in the diffusion approach of open channel flow (cf. Equations (5.88) and (5.92)). In the present case of a sloping aquifer the hydraulic diffusivity is not simply (10.89), but it contains the slope effect, or (10.135) In addition (10.134) contains a hydraulic (groundwater) advectivity (10.136) By analogy with flood wave propagation in open channels, a disturbance of the water table height in a sloping aquifer can be visualized as undergoing two types of changes. The first is a deformation of its shape, which is governed by the diffusivity (10.135); the second is a displacement of this disturbance down the slope, whose rate of propagation is given by the advectivity (10.136). Similarity considerations The boundary conditions (10.133) and the form of the governing differential equation = η cosα/ (10.137) t+ k n t Equation (10.134) becomes in terms of these variables ∂η ∂2η ∂η Hi (10.138) groundwater outflow and base flow In (10.138) Hi can be called the groundwater hillslope flow number, which is defined Hi (10.139) Equation(10.138)isintheformoftheadvectiondiffusionequation;becauseitisdimen- sionless it has a unit diffusivity. From a comparison between Equations (10.95) and (10.138),itcanbeseenthatthedimensionlessparameterHi,representstherelativemag- nitude of the slope term, that is the effect of gravity, versus the diffusion term. This ratio increases with the slope and with the “shallowness” of the aquifer. For large values of Hi the diffusion term, i.e. the first term on the right of Equation (10.138), is negligible, and the kinematic flow approximation (see Section 10.5) is valid. For small values of Hi (i.e. a small slope and/or a relatively deep aquifer with large )) the problem can be treated as one of horizontal flow, and the solution can be approximated by (10.106). Solution The boundary conditions (10.133) can be written in dimensionless form +Hi η = = ≥ (10.140) η = ≤ ≤ = The solution of (10.138), subject to (10.140) can be obtained by means of the Laplace transform.

The second feature is that, as the hillslope flow number Hi increases, the outflow hydrograph gradually displays from the fact that, as Hi becomes larger, the relative importance of the diffusion term in Equation(10.138)(thefirsttermontheright)decreasescomparedtotheadvectiveterm(the secondtermontheright).Thismeansthatthenatureoftheflowintheaquiferbecomesless diffusiveandmorekinematic,thatis,increasinglydrivenbygravityonaccountoftheslope. AswillbediscussedfurtherinSection10.5,kinematicmotionispurelytranslatorywithout change in shape of the water table. In the present case described by Equation (10.138), in the early stages, while all the higher order terms in the series solution are still active, diffusion causes the water table near the outlet to spread out, a behavior not unlike that of flood waves in open channels, discussed in Chapter 7; but later on, as the kinematic effect groundwater outflow and base flow takesover,thebulkofthewaterleftintheaquifertendstomovedownmoreasatranslatory wave, causing the appearance of a “pause” in the hydrograph during the transition between the two regimes. The occurrence of this pause is related to the time when the height of the water table approaches zero at the divide, where 1. The rate at which the water tableheightapproacheszeroatthedivide,likethestrengthofthepauseillustratedinFigure 10.27,dependsmainlyonthemagnitudeofthehillslopeflownumberHi.Actually,itcanbe seen that Equation (10.141) predicts that at the divide can never become zero, and that with time it can only approach it exponentially. This is somewhat counterintuitive, because the hydraulic groundwater approach is based on the assumption that the water table is a true free surface and thus a sharp interface; therefore physically, there is no reason why η ,t+)wouldnotbeabletobecome0at = suchasharpinterface +(x+ 1,anditwouldbe expected that after this occurs, the point of 0 would slide down along the bottom of the aquifer from 1 in the direction of 0. Originally, the fact that (10.141) does not predict such a sequence of events was thought to be caused by the shortcomings of the hydraulic approach with the Boussinesq equation; it was recently (Stagnitti al., 2004) shown, however, that this is not the case, and that it is in fact the result of the linearization of that equation. This should not be surprising, as it is well known that solutions of the linear diffusion equation usually do not exhibit sharp fronts, but rather long exponential tails; other examples of this or similar features can be found in applications of the linear diffusion equation in open channel flow (Equation (5.95) and Figure 5.9) and in infiltration Equation (10.141) to allow the water table height 0 to move down along the bottom oftheaquiferpastx+ 1,maynotbeacrucialissueinhillslopehydrology.Inrealaquifers, the falling water table is not a sharp drying front, and the flow is more closely described by theRichardsequation,thanbytheBoussinesqequation.Thismeansthatthesolutionofthe linearized formulation, viz. Equation (10.141), with its asymptotic approach to zero, may not necessarily provide a worse approximation than the sharp interface description. Still, regardless of these shortcomings, the analysis of the linearized problem shows how with increasing Hi, the diffusive aspects of the phenomenon gradually become less important, and perhaps even irrelevant in the description of hillslope flows in actual catchments; this suggests that for large values of Hi, say in excess of 10, it may be preferable to use the considerably simpler kinematic approach outlined below in Section 10.5.

For large values of the slope, and thus of the hillslope flow number Hi, the effect of advection overwhelms the diffusion. This can also be seen in Equations (10.134) and (10.138). In the kinematic wave approach, Hi is assumed to be sufficiently large that the pressure gradient term, leading to the diffusive term, can be simply neglected; thus the hydraulic gradient in (10.128) is assumed to be equal to the bed slope sin and (10.29) reduces to a first-order linear equation, as follows ∂η sinα ∂η (10.150) This approach was briefly introduced by Boussinesq (1877) for steep slopes; in the simple case of outflow without recharge I, he pointed out that, because (10.150) is in the form of a total derivative dη ∂η ∂η = + = 0, a water table height travels down the slope at a speed (10.151) Conversely, to an imaginary observer traveling down the slope at a speed given by Equation (10.151), it would appear that the height of the water table does not change withtime.Thisresultisnotunexpected,anditisanalogouswithopenchannelflow,inthat the advectivity of the diffusion equation (10.136) and the celerity of the kinematic wave (10.151)areidentical,orc .Incontrasttothekinematicwaveinopenchannelflow, Boussinesq’sresult(10.151)hasthefollowingtwofeatures.First,itcanbeseenthatc is independent of This means that all values of travel at the same speed, and the water table maintains its original shape as it moves downhill. For example, a rectangular input pulse of precipitation, which enters the aquifer instantaneously at the soil surface, will flow out from the aquifer into the stream channel as a time-delayed rectangular output pulse.Second,itcouldbearguedthatEquation(10.151)doesnotreallydescribeawave; groundwater outflow and base flow indeed, to the extent that the drainable porosity represents the mobile water in the soil (so that ) can be considered immobile water as indicated in Figure 10.12), Equation (10.151) is also the true velocity of the water in the aquifer. Therefore, it is perhaps preferable to refer to this phenomenon as kinematic flow, rather than kinematic wave. It can be seen that the reason for this equality of fluid and wave velocity is the inherent linearity of (10.150). On the other hand, it should also be remembered that, in spite of its name, the real physical significance of is not obvious; it was introduced as a mere parameter to compensate for the neglect of the partly saturated flow above the water table in the soil by the free surface approximation. While the fraction of the soil volume below the water table occupied by flowing water is not as large as the total porosity , it is probably larger than , because not all the flowing water is removed by the drainage process. Therefore, the true velocity of the water in the aquifer is not likely to be as large as (10.151). This means that it can be expected that the water table motion down a steep slope may still have certain features of a wave; but on account of the obscure physical nature of , these features are unclear and the phenomenon will require further study. The applicability of the kinematic wave approach was studied by Henderson and Wooding(1964),bycomparingtheirresultspresentedinSection6.2.2appliedtoground- water, i.e. for the case 0, with those obtainable with the full Boussinesq equation. They concluded that the differences can be significant for the decay phase, as obtain- able, for example, from the groundwater analog of Equation (6.27). As mentioned, in the kinematic approach the hydraulic gradient is assumed to be equal to the bed slope; in practice, this is usually taken to be the same as the ground surface slope. The main practical drawback of this approach is that it is unsuitable when a wide range of slopes has to be considered, including very small ones in relatively flat terrain. However, for steep slopes or large values of the hillslope flow number Hi this approach can be a useful tool to describe the flow.

{"paragraph": "10.6.1 General features Base flow is the discharge rate in a river that results from the natural release of the water stored in the upstream river channels and adjoining riparian aquifers in the absence of precipitation, snowmelt, or other inputs. In general, this type of flow depends primarily on the physiographic characteristics of the basin, on the distribution of water storage in river channels and in groundwater aquifers, and possibly also on the evaporation from the basin. These physiographic characteristics are mainly the geomorphology of the landscape and of the stream network, and the configuration and nature of the riparian aquifers and near-surface soils; these characteristics reflect the geology and the climate catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Fig.10.29 Schematicplanviewofafirst-ordercatchmentillustratingtheintegrationofthelocaloutflowrates fromtheriparianunconfinedaquiferstoderivethetotaloutflowfromtheareaaccordingtoEquation denotesthelinealcoordinatealongtheriver; thebreadthsoftheaquifersontheleftandrightbanks,respectively;thedashedlinesindicatethe heightcontourlinesofthelandsurface. of the basin, which can be considered as time invariant at the usual time scales of the major components of the hydrologic cycle. The effect of the channel storage under base flow conditions is normally quite small. Indeed, the water stored in river channels is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than that stored in active groundwater aquifers (see also Table 1.3). Moreover, typical travel times of water in a river tend to be orders of magnitude smaller than those in the adjoining groundwater aquifers. Under certain conditions, groundwater evaporation can have a seasonal effect; however, because groundwater evaporation can take place only from limited areas, usually near theriverbanks,wherethewatertablesarecloseenoughtothesurface,thiseffectisoften negligible (see Zecharias and Brutsaert, 1988b). From these considerations, it is apparent that the base flow at any point in the river, Q(t), is mainly the result of groundwater drainage; thus it can usually be assumed to represent the instantaneous integral of all upstream local groundwater out- flows, taken along the river channels all the way to the headwaters. With this assumption the flow rate in a river at the outlet of a catchment under base flow conditions can be formulated as Q(t) (10.152) wheres istheupstreamlinealcoordinatealongallriverchannelsinthebasin, isthetotal length of these channels, and and the groundwater inflows from the left and the right bank, respectively (see Figure 10.29). Since the physiography ofthebasindoesnotchangewithtime,thelocalgroundwateroutflowratesq and are likelytobeuniqueandtime-invariantfunctionsofthelocalgroundwaterstorage.Because and depend on the coordinate s, Equation (10.152) indicates that the basin-scale base flow Q(t) depends not only on the total water storage in the basin, but also on the areal distribution of that storage over the basin. However, the storage distribution does not always remain the same and it evolves, usually as a direct result of the spatial groundwater outflow and base flow distribution of the antecedent precipitation. This means that Q(t) need not be a unique function of time. Over smaller catchments, when the precipitation can be assumed to be sufficiently uniform, this may not be a problem. However, for larger basins it is not easy to define a unique base flow function from experimental data. This difficulty of non- uniqueness is aggravated by the fact that also the time reference, that is 0, is almost impossible to define. Indeed, in the case of a long-term streamflow record with base flow episodically interrupted by stormflow events resulting from precipitation, it is not a simple matter to identify the start of each base flow episode.

It is, of course, also the response of a lumped linear storage element, as used in the hydrologic systems approach (see Section 12.2.2). The fact that (10.153) has the same exponential form as these physically based expressions of Section 10.4 provides a strong indication that the storage delay constant can be expected to depend on the soil catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Dailydischargedatainm3s−1measured Fig.10.30 duringstreamflowrecessionsoverafive-year periodonFallCreek,nearIthaca,NY.Therate offlowontheithdayisplottedagainsttherate offlowonthe(i+1)thday.Theareaofthis catchmentis326km2. 0 10 20 30 properties and , the thickness and the breadth of the riparian aquifers, their slopes and possibly other basin characteristics. This will be further investigated in Section 10.6.3. In some applications, the exponential outflow function is represented in a different form, as (10.154) inwhich isthedepletionratio,n ofduration(cid:14)t sincethestartoftherecession,whent istakenaszero,and istherateof flow at the ith time interval. Equation (10.154) is derived by assuming that the decrease in flow rate from any time to time (t is constant, so that , t Q Q K Q , and so on. This shows that (10.154) is just another form of (10.153) = −(cid:14)t/K. with ln(K ) It also means that, in light of the similarity of (10.153) with the same soil, aquifer, and basin characteristics as K. The applicability of (10.153) or (10.154), that is the linearity of the basin for base flow, can be checked graphically by plotting versus for available recession flow data. An example of such data is shown in Figure 10.30. The upper envelope of these points describes the fastest rate of decrease in flow rate on record; it can therefore be assumed to be caused by the depletion of channel storage during a storm flow event and, as will be discussed below, depletion of the steeper hill slopes in the basin. On the other hand, the lower envelope, which describes the slowest rate of decrease on record, can be assumed to represent base flow recession, due to the depletion of groundwater storage in the riparian aquifers. If the base flow recession is truly linear and given by Equation (10.154), must be constant; because is the slope of the lower envelope, it should be a straight line. In the example shown in Figure 10.30, the points do not quite have a straight line lower envelope, and therefore for this basin the possibility of a nonlinear base flow regime cannot be excluded. This procedure of plotting versus groundwater outflow and base flow withtheupperenvelopewasprobablyintroducedbyLangbein(1938),whoapplied ittocharacterizechannelstoragerecession.ItwaslaterextendedbyLinsleyetal.(1958) to characterize also the base flow recession by using the lower envelope.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of base flow recession, what is the significance of Equation (10.153) and its parameters?", "answer": "Equation (10.153) represents base flow recession as an exponential decay process, where the flow rate is described by the equation = exp(−t/K), with  being the initial flow rate and K being a constant representing the characteristic storage delay in the watershed.

Eventually, after surface runoff and interflow are depleted, the recession consists only of groundwater drainage, indicating that the exponential decay function can capture the different components of flow recession.

If the points do not quite have a straight line lower envelope, as seen in the example in Figure 10.30, the possibility of a nonlinear base flow regime cannot be excluded, suggesting that the base flow recession may not be accurately described by Equation (10.154)."}, {"question": "How does the procedure of plotting versus  relate to the characterization of base flow recession and channel storage recession?", "answer": "The procedure of plotting versus  was initially introduced by Langbein (1938) to characterize channel storage recession, using the upper envelope of the points to describe the fastest rate of decrease in flow rate on record.

This approach allows for the graphical identification of base flow recession and the distinction between channel storage recession and base flow recession."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic systems, why is the storage delay constant expected to depend on soil, aquifer, and basin characteristics?", "answer": "The storage delay constant is expected to depend on soil, aquifer, and basin characteristics because these factors influence the movement and storage of water within the watershed. The properties of the riparian aquifers, such as their thickness, breadth, and slopes, as well as the soil catchment-scale base flow parameterizations, can affect the rate at which groundwater is depleted and, therefore, the storage delay constant. Understanding these relationships is crucial for accurately characterizing base flow recession and predicting groundwater outflow."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the linearity of the basin for base flow, and how can it be checked?", "answer": "The linearity of the basin for base flow refers to the assumption that the relationship between the flow rate and time can be described by a linear equation, such as Equation (10.154).

{"paragraph": "10.6.3 Base flow decline rate: recession slope analysis Under conditions when freezing, thawing and snowmelt do not play a role, long-term streamflow records normally consist of base flow episodes that alternate with episodes of storm flow resulting from precipitation. In general, except when it is an exponential function of time, the functional form of the base flow obtained from streamflow data is sensitive to the choice or definition of 0, that is the assumed start of each base flow episode. This uncertainty in the determination of a consistent time reference can be avoided by eliminating the time variable from the analysis of the data, and by taking insteaditsdifferentialdt.Thiscanbedonebyconsideringnotthehydrograph Q(t)itself, but rather its slope as a function of Q, as follows (Q) (10.155) where ( ) is a function that is characteristic for a given catchment. With actual stream- (cid:14)t flow measurements versus at successive times apart, this function can be approximated by (cid:2) (cid:3) (10.156) (cid:14)t The rate of decline of groundwater outflow is markedly slower than that of other streamflow input components, resulting from precipitation related events, such as over- land runoff or channel storage depletion. Therefore in the application of Equation (10.155) it can be assumed that base flows represent the smallest for a given |dQ/dt|). (or the largest rate of flow for a given This means that in any graphical representationof(Q dataversus(Q the function ( ) in (10.155) can be taken as the lower envelope. The main objective of such a procedure is to capture some characteristics of the ensemble of many recessions, which cannot possibly be seen or detected by analyzing individual recessions. Indeed, in a natural catchment, hydrographs and their recessions come in many different shapes and they can vary greatly from one runoff event to the next. The shape of a hydrograph depends on many factors, such as the spatial distribution of the initial soil moisture content, the spatial distribution of the water table levels, and the spatial and temporal distribution of the prior precipitation events over the catchment. This infinity in possible outcomes and the large variability and non-uniqueness of shapes is illustrated by the fact that when one plots daily values of vsQ for a natural watershed one obtains a broad cloud of points. Figure 10.31 shows an example. Thus the lower envelope is the locus of points for the slowest recession rate conversely, it represents also the largest flow rate for any given recession rate Inprinciple,thislargestflowrateistheonethatwouldbeobserved(eventhoughthismay catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Datapoints−dQ/dt Fig.10.31 plottedagainst observedduringtheperiod1961–1974onTonkawaCreekin Oklahoma,withthelowerenvelopelineswithslopes1and3,respectively,inaccordancewithEquation 67km2,thetotallengthofallstreamchannelsis (10.157).Thedrainageareaofthisbasinis =70km,andtheestimatedmeandepthofthesurfaceaquifersis =1.6m.(FromBrutsaertand Lopez,1998.) never occur) if the entire watershed were initially and uniformly saturated. In natural catchments, the exact form of the base flow function Q(t) is usually unknown, especially when the characteristics of the riparian aquifers deviate markedly from those of the idealized cases considered above in Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5. Thus, beside the avoidance of the time origin problem, the procedure based on Equations (10.155) and (10.156) also has the advantage that it will give some insight into which of the above theoretical expressions may be applicable, if at all. Unfortunately, however, because it involves derivatives, this procedure is also sensitive to unavoidable inherent errors in the data. It is therefore advisable to constrain such envelopes somewhat on the basis of available theoretical considerations, as shown next. groundwater outflow and base flow Fig.10.32 Simplifiedschematicrepresentationofthecatchmentshownin Figure10.29,illustratingtheuseofthe spatiallyconstanteffectiveparametersq B and todescribethecatchment-scalegroundwateroutflow Q.Thusitisassumedthat Q 2qL 2LB. rate and Application with available groundwater outflow solutions For several well-known solutions of the Boussinesq equation, describing groundwa- ter outflow from an unconfined aquifer based on the hydraulic approach, it can be function, (10.157) where and are constants. Equation (10.157) is obtainable from each of these solutions by assuming geometric similarity of the drainage pattern and the channel network within the catchment. With this assumption, and by defining an equivalent or effective lateral inflow rate into the stream, one can immediately integrate (10.152) as follows 2L (10.158) As before, is the total length of all tributary and main channel sections upstream from the gauging station where the stream flow is Q. Likewise one can define an effective aquifer breadth B, as the distance from channel to divide (see Figure 10.32) by = A/(2L) (10.159) in which is the drainage area of the catchment, and is known as the drainage density. Equation (10.159) is the same as the relationship proposed by Horton (1945) for the average overland flow distance in a catchment whose channel slope is much smaller than the land surface slopes. The first of these solutions, that can be put in the form of (10.157), is the short-time outflow rate (10.64), which was obtained by Boltzmann similarity and which exhibits the characteristic behavior. Upon substitution of (10.158), (10.64) yields the basin- scale outflow rate (cid:12) (cid:13) 0.66412 (10.160) catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Operatingonthisresultinthemannerof(10.157),oneobtainsinthiscaseforitsconstants (cid:12) (cid:13) (10.161) = −1.1336 in which the subscripts 1 indicate that it is the first solution which is considered here.

In past applications, this was done by inspection of the slope of the lower envelope of the low flows as they appear on a log–log plot of vs Q. This is illustrated in Figure 10.31, in which the slope of the envelope happens to be close to one, or 1 in Equation (10.157). This has also been done by linear regression with all the data log(−dQ/dt) points of against log(Q). Neither procedure appears to be objective, and at present, it is still not clear how an appropriate a priori value of can be determined, which describes the long-time behavior of a given basin. In the catchment studies by Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) and Troch al. (1993), it was concluded that whereas in Vogel and Kroll (1992), Brutsaert and Lopez (1998) and Eng and Brutsaert (1999) it was decided to be 1. This will require further study. Once the appropriate long-time outflow expression and its value of have been decided upon, the value of and (or ) can be determined from the lower envelopes with slopes 3 and 1 (or respectively, on a log–log plot of the available vs data. Examples of the procedure are shown in Figures 10.31 and 10.33. In what follows, the determination of the basin-scale aquifer parameters is outlined for the linear case with 1; however, the analogous analysis with is straightforward, and can be left as an exercise for the reader. The value of is related to the extinction coefficient of the exponential outflow equation (10.153) by (10.171) catchment-scale base flow parameterizations Fig.10.33 SameasFigure10.31,butfortheperiod1966–1977onSaltCreekinOklahoma.Thedrainageareaof 62km2,thetotallengthofallstreamchannelsis A= =76km,andtheestimatedmean thisbasinis depthofthesurfaceaquifersis 1.4m.(FromBrutsaertandLopez,1998.)

The values of these two parameters obtained with this method appear to lie well within the accepted ranges for field measurements in other studies. It is also not surprising that the hydraulic conduc- tivities are several orders of magnitude larger than values to be expected on the basis of laboratory measurements or by “sandbox” standards. This is because of macropores and preferential flow paths that become operative at larger spatial scales. More importantly, however,thevaluesshowninthefiguresarewithinareasonablerangefromoneanother; this suggests that the arguably oversimplified hydraulic approach and the method of slope analysis can serve a useful purpose. The same study also showed that the characteristic outflow time (a K) is well correlated with spatial scale L, that is the length of all stream channels in the basin; the obtained correlation coefficient was This is not unexpected in light of Equation (10.165), but as the drainage density does not vary widely in this region, the predictive power of the relationship between and was found to be weak.

Among the other parameters, the hydraulic conduc- tivity was found to be only weakly (if at all) scale correlated in that range of scales of 2km). The hydraulic diffusivity , the hydraulic desorptivity , and the drain- able porosity or specific yield showed no evidence of any scale dependency in the same range of scales. The effect of mean aquifer slope From the analyses developed in this chapter it is clear that the slope of the riparian aquifers canbeexpectedtoexertastronginfluenceonthemagnitudeandevolutionofthebaseflow fromabasin.Cursoryinspectionoftheunitresponsefunctionofahillslope(10.146)withthe accompanyingFigures10.27and10.28indicatesthatHicanindeedplayamajorrole.This wasalsobroughtoutintheinvestigationofmeasureddroughtflowdatafrom19watersheds in a mountainous section of the Appalachian Plateau by Zecharias and Brutsaert (1985; 1988a); the results of a factor analysis indicated that, among the geomorphic parameters that are related to groundwater outflow, total length of perennial streams, drainage density and average basin slope are most closely related to the process. Moreover, the influences of these three parameters on groundwater outflow behavior are independent of each other; thus,theinclusionofadditionalparameterswouldnotnecessarilyyieldabetterrelationship, andmayresultinredundancy.Thisempiricalresultisconsistentwiththelinearbasin-scale indicates that L, and Hi are the only three geomorphic parameters which control the flow. For the present purpose, geomorphic parameters may be considered the ones that can be derived from topographic maps. Unfortunately, in contrast to stream length and drainage density, until now attempts to includeslopeinbasin-scaleparameterizationshavebeenlessthansuccessful.Theproblem was addressed in Zecharias and Brutsaert (1988b) in the context of the applicability of Equation (10.157) in hilly terrain.

However, theresultsalsoshowed,thatinthesesameplotsboththeslopeoftheupperenvelopeandthe mean slope through all the data points, decrease with time. For instance, in one watershed in the region, with flow values that occurred 2, 4, 6, and 7 days following a rainfall event, the slopes of the upper envelopes were observed to evolve as 0.33, 0.23, 019, and d−1, d−1. 0.15 respectively, whereas the lower envelopes remained at around 0.063 As illustrated in Figure 10.38, a similar evolution of of the upper envelopes was observed in the Washita River Basin. Thevalueoftherateofflow ofarecedinghydrographdependsmainlyonthestorage of water in the watershed. But the upper envelope in graphical representations like Figure 10.38 provides information on the groundwater outflow regime in the early stages of a dry periodwhentheratesofrecession,i.e.−dQ/dt,arehigh.Thesuccessivevaluesofa that there are aquifers in the basin whose recession rates are initially large, but decrease sensibly as the rainless period continues. Advanced states of the outflow process, which are accompanied by small recession rates, are represented by the lower envelopes, whose values in the successive scatter diagrams remain essentially the same. It is likely that the variation of the parameter of the upper envelopes with time is largely the result of groundwater outflow and base flow Datapoints−dQ/dt Fig.10.38 plottedagainst observedoverdroughtflowepisodeswiththefirstday duringtheperiod1962–1977onWestBitterCreekwithintheWashitaRiverbasinin 154km2,thetotallengthofstreamsis Oklahoma.Thedrainageareaofthisbasinis 161km,andtheestimatedmeandepthofthesurfaceaquifersis 1.3m.(FromBrutsaert andLopez,1998.) references the nonuniform distribution of the physical characteristics within a catchment. Equation (10.167) indicates that the steeper parts of a basin, where Hi is larger, must have faster depletion rates, and therefore larger values of a; such areas are usually located near the headwater sections of a basin. In contrast the downstream regions of a basin have smaller inclinations, hence relatively lower rates of depletion. All this shows that, although the characterization of a basin as a single lumped unit with basin scale parameters is a useful paradigm, it has definite limitations. The total outflow rate is the sum of flow contributions from aquifer sections with unequal response characteristics. This total flow is initially dominated by the discharges of channel storage and of the steeper aquifers, which contribute a large fraction of the total flow during the first few hours or days of a recession period. As the recession progresses, however, these storage elements become rapidly depleted and the gentler parts of the aquifer, now being the main contributors, determine the outflow. This also means that the determination of the basin scale aquifer properties by means of an analysis of the lower envelopes is valid mainly in relatively flat and even terrain. In more rugged catchments the lower envelope tendstoreflectthepropertiesofthebroadervalleysectionsinthelowerparts.Therefore,in practical applications for design purposes in hilly watersheds, it may be advisable to adopt an average value of and in Equation (10.157), say by regression through all the data points (rather than from the lower envelope alone), to describe representative basin scale parameters. These issues will require further study. REFERENCES Handbook of Mathematical Functions, Appl. Math. 55. National Washington, DC: Bureau of Standards. Aravin, V. I. and Numerov, S. N. (1953).

This uncertainty arises because the base flow is influenced by various factors, including the spatial distribution of initial soil moisture content, water table levels, and prior precipitation events over the catchment, leading to a high variability and non-uniqueness of hydrograph shapes."}, {"question": "In the context of Equation (10.157), what is the significance of the lower envelope in graphical representations of dQ/dt versus Q data?", "answer": "The lower envelope represents the locus of points for the slowest recession rate and, conversely, the largest flow rate for any given recession rate.

It is also related to the hydraulic diffusivity, and the storage half-life can be derived from it. Specifically, the storage half-life is given by -ln(2)/a, and the hydraulic diffusivity is given by -a (A/L)^2."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the spatial distribution of physical characteristics within a catchment when analyzing groundwater outflow and base flow?", "answer": "The spatial distribution of physical characteristics, such as the slope of the riparian aquifers, can significantly influence the magnitude and evolution of base flow from a basin. The steeper parts of a basin tend to have faster depletion rates, while the gentler parts have slower depletion rates. This non-uniform distribution of characteristics can lead to a total outflow rate that is the sum of flow contributions from aquifer sections with unequal response characteristics, making it challenging to characterize a basin as a single lumped unit with basin-scale parameters."}, {"question": "In the context of hilly watersheds, what are the limitations of using the lower envelope to determine basin-scale aquifer properties?", "answer": "In hilly watersheds, the lower envelope tends to reflect the properties of the broader valley sections in the lower parts of the basin, rather than the entire basin. Therefore, using the lower envelope to determine basin-scale aquifer properties may not be valid, and it may be more advisable to adopt an average value of a and b in Equation (10.157) by regression through all the data points to describe representative basin-scale parameters."}, {"question": "How does the hydraulic conductivity of a basin relate to the value of a in Equation (10.157), and what are the implications for estimating basin-scale aquifer parameters?", "answer": "The hydraulic conductivity of a basin can be related to the value of a in Equation (10.157) through the equations derived by combining (10.161) and (10.165). However, because there are three groundwater outflow parameters (a, k, and n) with only two equations, one of the parameters must be known or estimated by some other independent method. The estimated values of k and n can be obtained by combining Equations (10.161) and (10.165), but the values may show considerable variation. Using Equation (10.175) can constrain the erratic behavior of a and result in less variation in the estimated values of k and n."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to include slope in basin-scale parameterizations, and what are the implications for groundwater outflow and base flow modeling?", "answer": "Including slope in basin-scale parameterizations has been less than successful due to the complexity of representing the spatial distribution of slope and its effects on groundwater outflow and base flow. The slope of the riparian aquifers can exert a strong influence on the magnitude and evolution of base flow, but attempts to include slope in parameterizations have been limited.

The value of α, which represents the rate of base flow recession, is influenced by factors such as the basin's geology, soil type, vegetation cover, and drainage network. A higher value of α indicates a faster rate of recession, suggesting that the basin has a more rapid response to rainfall and runoff, possibly due to its geomorphological characteristics.

The value of β, as influenced by parameters such as −3.82×10−7 s−1, reflects the basin's ability to sustain base flow over time, with higher values potentially indicating a greater capacity for base flow maintenance.

This means that the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, such as the water retention curve, are path-dependent, and neglecting hysteresis could lead to inaccurate predictions of groundwater flow and storage. The consideration of hysteresis is particularly important in modeling the behavior of unconfined aquifers that experience significant changes in saturation, such as during the transition from fully saturated to partly saturated conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow modeling, what principles govern the behavior of the partly saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer?", "answer": "The partly saturated zone is subject to the principle of continuity and Darcy’s law, which are fundamental principles governing groundwater flow.

This occurs when plants and the atmosphere remove water from the aquifer, reducing its storage and potentially affecting its ability to supply water to wells, rivers, and lakes. Evapotranspiration can be a significant factor in water balance, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where water resources are already limited. Understanding and managing evapotranspiration is crucial for sustainable groundwater management and maintaining ecosystem health."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, how do unconfined aquifers behave in the absence of recharge?", "answer": "In the absence of rain or other recharge, unconfined aquifers behave as linear reservoirs, whose outflow is given by an exponential decay function. This means that the rate at which water is discharged from the aquifer decreases over time, following an exponential curve. This behavior is significant for predicting and managing groundwater resources, as it allows hydrologists to estimate how long an aquifer can sustain a certain level of discharge without replenishment.

This exchange is crucial for maintaining the balance of water resources, supporting ecosystems, and influencing climate regulation. Understanding these characteristics is essential for managing water resources sustainably and mitigating the impacts of human activities on the hydrological cycle."}, {"question": "In the context of water resource management, what implications does the behavior of unconfined aquifers as linear reservoirs have?", "answer": "The behavior of unconfined aquifers as linear reservoirs has significant implications for water resource management. It suggests that the outflow from these aquifers can be predicted and managed using exponential decay functions, allowing for more accurate forecasting of water availability.

This variability makes it difficult to identify and quantify the different mechanisms that produce the observed streamflow hydrograph, Q(t), as the decomposition of an integral into its constituent parts is not straightforward. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of each basin, such as its geomorphology, soil properties, and climate, contribute to this complexity, making it a significant challenge in hydrology to develop universally applicable models or theories."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the horizontal scale of the problem and the vertical scale in the context of hydraulic groundwater theory, and what implications does this have for the applicability of potential flow theory?", "answer": "The hydraulic groundwater theory implies that the horizontal scale of the problem is of the same order as, or smaller than, the vertical scale, such as the depth of the impermeable layer. This relationship is crucial because it allows for the application of potential flow theory with Laplace’s equation, which simplifies the analysis of groundwater flow under certain conditions. However, this assumption might not always hold, especially in cases where the horizontal extent of the aquifer is significantly larger than its depth, potentially limiting the applicability of the theory."}, {"question": "How does the concept of equipotentials relate to the hydraulic head in the context of groundwater flow, and what does this imply about the flow region?", "answer": "The equipotentials, or lines and surfaces of constant hydraulic head, are horizontal according to the hydraulic groundwater theory. This implies that the flow region is fully saturated, as the hydraulic head is a measure of the energy of the water at a given point, and constant head lines indicate equal energy levels. The saturation of the flow region is a fundamental assumption in many groundwater flow models, and understanding the behavior of equipotentials is essential for predicting groundwater flow patterns and velocities."}, {"question": "In the context of streamflow generation, what role do local mechanisms play, and why is there currently no unifying theory to explain their integration into the streamflow process?", "answer": "Local mechanisms, such as precipitation, snowmelt, and other water inputs, are crucial in streamflow generation as they contribute to the observed hydrograph, Q(t), at any point along a river. However, despite a good understanding of these mechanisms individually, there is currently no unifying theory that coherently explains how these local processes integrate into the streamflow generation process. This lack of a comprehensive theory stems from the complexity and variability of drainage basins, making it challenging to develop a framework that can accurately predict streamflow based on the integration of local mechanisms."}, {"question": "Why is the decomposition of the streamflow hydrograph into its constituent parts, or the inversion of the integral to obtain the integrands, considered a complex task in hydrology?", "answer": "The decomposition of the streamflow hydrograph into its constituent parts is akin to \"unscrambling an omelet,\" indicating that it is not a simple matter. This complexity arises because the streamflow hydrograph at any point is the integrated result of all flow processes upstream in the catchment, including precipitation, snowmelt, and other inputs. Identifying and quantifying the specific contributions of each mechanism to the overall hydrograph is challenging due to the interconnected and nonlinear nature of these processes, as well as the unique characteristics of each drainage basin."}, {"question": "In the context of hydraulic groundwater theory, can effects of horizontal anisotropy be accounted for, and how does this relate to the Boussinesq equation?", "answer": "Yes, effects of horizontal anisotropy can still be taken into account by adjusting the Boussinesq equation.

{"paragraph": "11.1 RIPARIAN AREAS AND HEADWATER BASINS The transformation of precipitation, after it hits the land surface, into streamflow gen- erally takes place over an area of land along the river channel that extends from the channel banks to the nearest divide. Thus each channel segment of a river system can be visualized as lying between two strips of riparian land on either side that feed water into it. While the mechanisms involved in the transformation from precipitation to stream flow depend on many factors, an important one to consider is the relative size of the river segment within the river and tributary system of the basin. In geomorphology, it is customary to classify stream channels in a hierarchy of orders, in which the order of a stream depends on the number of upstream trib- utaries or bifurcations. Horton (1932; 1945) was probably the first to propose a downstream-moving ordering procedure. In this system, tributaries without branches are called first-order streams; the branches that receive only first-order streams are des- ignated second-order streams, and those that receive one or more second-order and also streamflow generation Fig.11.1 Theordernumbersofriverchannelsegmentsina naturalbasindrainagenetworkaccordingtothe Horton–Strahlermethod. first-order streams are considered third-order streams, and so on. The definition of first- and second-order streams is clear and unambiguous in Horton’s procedure, but the def- inition of third- and higher-order streams required some subjective decisions. To avoid these and to ensure that only one stream would bear the highest-order number in the basin, Strahler (1952) adjusted the procedure by stipulating that third-order streams can only be formed by the joining of any two second-order segments, and so on. The Horton–Strahler method, as it is now called, is illustrated in Figure 11.1; in this exam- ple, there are 18 first-order streams, five second-order streams, and one third-order Larger-orderriverchannelsusuallydonotreceivemuchwaterlocallyfromtheriparian surfaces along their banks, but they receive most of their water from upstream through lower-order streams. The catchments that are drained by lower-order streams with no or very few tributaries can be called basins, watersheds, or also headwater source area upland watersheds. Because they feed into channels of progressively higher order, these lower-order catchments are crucial for a better understanding of runoff mechanisms in larger basins as well. An important feature for the analysis of runoff from such headwater catchments is that lower-order river channels tend to have relatively short residence times; thus any storm runoff hydrograph from a source area watershed is affected primarily by the nature of the soil mantle areas surrounding the stream and very little by the nature of the stream itself. Further downstream, however, as more and more tributaries join, the shape of the hydrograph evolves, and it will increasingly reflect the hydraulic characteristics of the channel network. The flow mechanisms in riparian areas and headwater basins, a topic often referred to also as hillslope hydrology, have been the subject of intense research in the past few decades. A knowledge of these mechanisms and of their interactions is not only essential to describe streamflow generation, but it is also the key to a better understanding of solute transport in the human environment and of the evolution of landforms and erosion. storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.2 Illustrationoftheoverlandflow (OF)mechanismasinfiltration excess.Theprecipitationrate exceedsinfiltrationcapacity,and thewatertableisattheground surface.

This adjustment helps in maintaining a clear hierarchy and avoids ambiguity, especially in defining third- and higher-order streams."}, {"question": "Why are lower-order river channels crucial for understanding runoff mechanisms in larger basins?", "answer": "Lower-order river channels are crucial because they have relatively short residence times, meaning that any storm runoff hydrograph from a source area watershed is primarily affected by the nature of the surrounding soil mantle areas and very little by the nature of the stream itself. This characteristic makes them ideal for studying the fundamental processes of runoff generation without the complexities introduced by larger, more complex channel networks.

Initially, in headwater basins, the hydrograph is primarily influenced by the soil mantle areas surrounding the stream. However, as the water flows into larger channels, the characteristics of the channel itself, such as its geometry and roughness, begin to dominate the shape of the hydrograph, leading to changes in its peak, timing, and overall shape."}, {"question": "What is the primary factor influencing storm runoff hydrographs in source area watersheds?", "answer": "The primary factor influencing storm runoff hydrographs in source area watersheds is the nature of the soil mantle areas surrounding the stream, due to the relatively short residence times of lower-order river channels.

This classification is essential for understanding the hierarchical structure of river networks and for analyzing hydrological processes at different scales. It helps in identifying the relative importance of different streams in contributing to the overall flow and in predicting how changes in one part of the system might affect others."}, {"question": "How do larger-order river channels differ from smaller-order channels in terms of water input?", "answer": "Larger-order river channels typically do not receive much water locally from the riparian surfaces along their banks but instead receive most of their water from upstream through lower-order streams. This is in contrast to smaller-order channels, which may receive a significant portion of their water directly from the surrounding landscape. This difference highlights the importance of understanding the connectivity and flow pathways within a river system to manage water resources effectively."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the short residence times of lower-order river channels for storm runoff hydrograph analysis?", "answer": "The short residence times of lower-order river channels imply that storm runoff hydrographs from these areas are less influenced by the channel characteristics and more by the surrounding soil and land surface conditions.

{"paragraph": "11.2.1 Overland flow Infiltration excess overland flow Thistypeofflowoccurswhentherainfallrateislargerthantheinfiltrationcapacity,sothat there is an excess which runs off over the surface. Although this flow generation concept is sometimes associated with the name of Horton (1933), it goes back much earlier. It was already the basis of the well-known rational method, introduced 150 years ago by Mulvany (1850), and of the various runoff routing procedures subsequently derived implicit in the unit hydrograph, as originally proposed by Sherman (1932a; b). In these and other early studies concerned with maximal rates of runoff in problems of flooding and erosion, it was assumed that the infiltration rate is smaller than the precipitation rate over the entire catchment. In the rational method, the infiltration is taken as a fraction of the precipitation, whereas in the unit hydrograph approach and in Horton’s work, the infiltration capacity or a related index is subtracted from the precipitation. Thus it was assumed that the infiltrated water is “lost” and that virtually all stormflow results from the overland flow of the precipitation excess (see Figure 11.2). In the prediction of extreme flows for design purposes in disaster situations, this assumption of overland flow was not unreasonable. It is now understood that overland flow is not a universally occurring phenomenon, that in many situations it may not occur at all, and that its prevalence depends on the nature of the catchment and of the intensity of the precipitation. But it can be expected to be the main mechanism in catchments with relatively impermeable surfaces, and with only a thin soil layer; such surfaces cover mostly urban environments, factory and farm yards and other trampled soil areas, and rocky and stony areas with little or no soil or vegetation, as seen in arid and desert environments. Thus it occurs most frequently in areas where people live and work and in denuded arid regions. It can also occur on other more permeable surfaces, provided the rainfall is sufficiently intense. For instance, in a study of a 20 ha first-order agricultural catchment with steep slopes in semi-arid Shanxi streamflow generation Fig.11.3 Schematicillustrationof theoverlandflow(OF) mechanismassaturation excess:(a)thepositionof thewatertable(WT)prior totheonsetofprecipitation and(b)duringthe precipitationevent.

Occurrence and yield of overland flow varied spatially on account of the variability of the infiltration capacity. Ingeneral,infiltrationexcessoverlandflowappearstoberareinnaturalbasinscovered with a thriving vegetation in more humid climates. Saturation excess overland flow This type of surface runoff occurs over land surfaces that are saturated by emerging subsurface outflow from below and perched water tables, regardless of the intensity of the rainfall (or snowmelt) (see Figure 11.3). It is a rapid and almost immediate transport mechanism to the stream channel, for the seepage outflow water and for the rainwater falling (or snow melting) on such areas.

The expanding and shrinking areas are often referred to as variable source areas (see Figure 11.4). On the basis of hill slope measurements in Vermont, Dunne and Black (1970a; b) also concluded that the stormflow originated fromsurfaceflowonlimitedareasalongthestreamchannel.However,theirinterpretation of the mechanism was that this surface runoff was not fed significantly by subsurface outflow, but resulted mostly from rainfall on the expanding streamside areas; the role of the subsurface flow was mainly to control the expansion and subsequent contraction of the source areas.

{"paragraph": "11.2.2 Subsurface stormflow In many catchments under natural conditions infiltration is never exceeded, and the precipitation and other input can readily enter into the ground surface; thus the sub- sequent flow to the stream channel takes place below the surface, presumably through the soil mantle of the catchment. Lowdermilk (1934) and Hursh (1936) appear to have been among the first to propose subsurface flow as the main streamflow generation mechanism in forested hill slopes (see also Hewlett,1974). It was later confirmed in sev- eral experimental investigations that subsurface flow can even be the only mechanism Weyman, 1970). The notion that subsurface flow is an important, and sometimes the only process of water transmission, was resisted by many on the grounds that porous media flow is generally much too slow compared with overland flow to be able to produce the observed streamflows. One early explanation of this paradox was suggested by Hursh (1944),whoassumedthatthetransporttakesplacethroughsecondaryporosityofparticle aggregates, forming a three-dimensional lattice pattern, and through hydraulic pathways consisting of dead root channels and animal burrows (see also Section 8.3.1). At the time, this possibility of macropore flow and piping seems to have been largely dismissed asunrealisticbyexperimentalistsandmostlyignoredbymodelers.However,subsequent experimentalworkinthefield,someofitwithchemicalandisotopictracers,hasproduced ampleandincontrovertibleevidencenotonlyformacroporeflowanditsimportance,but for several other mechanisms enhancing subsurface flow as well. These are considered more closely in what follows. Macropores and other preferential flow paths The concept of preferential flow paths or macropores is an old one; “little channels” and “light soil, mixed with pebbles and roots of trees” were invoked as early as the 1680s by Mariotte to explain infiltration and to refute the claims of Seneca and Perrault that rain water cannot possibly penetrate the soil to be the source of springs. In general, macropores can be defined as secondary, often pipe-like structures of the soil matrix, thataretheremainsofpurelyphysicalprocesses,suchaserosioninitiatedbydesiccation cracking, and different forms of biological activity, such as decaying plant root channels storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.5 Schematicrepresentationofasoilprofilewithafragipanhorizon.(FromSmalleyandDavin,1982, afterVanVlietandLangohr,1981.) andanimalburrowsofvarioussizes.ReviewsonthesubjecthavebeenpresentedbyJones (1971) and Beven and Germann (1982). Because soil drying and biological activity tend to take place near the ground surface, pipes and macropores are usually most abundant in the top soil layers and they tend to become less frequent with depth. Such structures are usually obvious features of soil profiles at banks and road cuts. In addition to these macropores, different other types of preferential flow paths have been observed, which may also have ramifications for the relative transport of pre-event and event water to the stream channel. Recall that pre-event water, also called old water, is the water present in the soil mantle before the onset of the precipitation, whereas the event water, often called new water, is the water resulting from the precipitation. In one type of preferential flow, the paths can often be observed at the surface of clayey and loamysoilsascracksorfracturesresultingfromtheshrinkageoftheclayparticlesduring drying episodes. At least during the initial stages of a precipitation event, before clay swelling closes them again, such cracks can facilitate the downward water movement in the profile. A somewhat related type of preferential flow has been observed in fissured fragipan horizons (Parlange et al., 1989), as illustrated in Figure 11.5. A fragipan is streamflow generation typically a loamy clay layer with very low conductivity and higher bulk density than the overlying layers. However, in some cases during their evolution, fragipan horizons became fractured into a polygonal columnar structure with a network of interconnected vertical fissures, again, as a result of shrinkage of the clay particles; these cracks are then believed to have been filled with more permeable soil material from above, greatly facilitating water transport. The cracks are typically 10–20 cm wide. In another type of preferentialflow,thepathsareinitiallyestablishedasinstabilitiesorfingersatinfiltrating wetting fronts in coarse soils, when the infiltration rate is smaller than the saturated conductivity. A crucial point, however, is that, once established, these paths usually become permanent features of the profile, each time the soil is being rewetted (Glass et al., 1989); exceptions may occur when the soil has undergone complete drying out or completesaturation,bothofwhicharerareifnotunlikelyinnature.Figure11.6showsan example of the initial growth of fingers observed in the laboratory. Such fingers are not so obvious in the soil profile, but they become visible with dyes or other tracers. Other aspects of the nature and origin of this type of preferential paths have been clarified (see Selker al., 1992; Liu al., 1994a; b). Although the existence of macropores has been known for a long time, the precise nature of their contribution to the streamflow generation processes has been emerging only gradually. A few examples follow of investigations in which macropores were observed to play a major role. In a small basin in east-central Honshu, Tanaka et al. (1981; 1988) observed that more than 90% of the storm runoff came from below the ground surface mainlythroughpipeflow;somesaturationoverlandflowoccurredoverthegentlerslopes (S of the valley floor, when the rainfall exceeded 50 mm; the saturated area varied somewhat in location and extent from storm to storm, but it never occupied more than 4.5% of the total area (see Figures 11.7 and 11.8). No overland flow was ever observed on the steep (S hillsides. In a 0.47 ha forested catchment in Tennessee, Wilson al. (1991) found that the initial subsurface stormflow water in moderate to high intensity events consisted mainly of new, i.e. event water; they concluded from this that it had bypassed the unsaturatedsoilmatrix,inwhichthepre-eventwaterwasstored,viamacroporeswithout ever reaching the water table. Later on, however, as the flow continued, the fraction of old water gradually increased.

In summer, however, overland flow was found to be dominant; they did not observe evidence of partial area sources, as only a negligible fraction of the catchment was occupied by wetland. OnasteepforestedhillslopewithcedarandcypressinIbarakiineast-centralHonshu, Tsuboyama et al. (1994) observed a dynamic system of macropores, which expanded and conducted increasing amounts of water as antecedent conditions became wetter.

Chemical analysis of measurements on a 0.75 ha forested first-order catchment in the sub-Andean foreland basin of Peru by Elsenbeer et al. (1995b) indicated that the stormflow response is dominated by event water. This water traveled to the stream channel as a combination of overland flow and through pipes. Some pipe flow reached the stream directly, but some emerged to the surface before reaching the stream. The overland flow was thus generated by emerging pipe flow and directly by the rain. This made them observe that, from the perspective of the catchment, the distinction betweenpipeflowandoverlandflowismeaningless,asbothmechanismsproducedevent From observations in a semiarid pine forest in New Mexico, Newman et al. (1998) concluded that most of the lateral subsurface flow takes place in the B horizon through macropores.Thusthroughoutmostoftheyear,thesoilprofilebehaveslikeatwo-domain storm runoff mechanisms Fig.11.8 Theprecipitation andrunoff hydrographofthe 195mmstorm eventonthe catchmentshown inFigure11.7. (FromTanaka etal.,1981.) system; this consists of a macropore domain, which provides rapid subsurface flow that is not in equilibrium with the soil matrix, and of a matrix domain, in which the trans- port is very slow and in which evaporative processes cause major water losses and increased salinity (see Figure 11.9). Variations in the ratio of old to new water in the runoff were seen to depend mainly on the size of the precipitation event; macropores can conduct the flow directly or they may also feed shallow perched saturated zones overly- ing low permeability bedrock. Whenever the entire profile is fully saturated, as during snowmelt episodes, the two domains are connected, and large subsurface flow rates are produced. In the above studies it was shown how subsurface flow through macropores and other preferential flow paths can play a major role in storm runoff generation. However, the specific interpretations of the measurements, especially on the relative roles of old and newwaterinthisprocess,differedsomewhat,andinsomecasestheywerecontradictory. Although this is largely the result of the wide variety in catchments that were being studied, it is no doubt also related to the differences in experimental techniques used in these studies. This was brought out, for example, in the long-term observations, carried out on the steep mixed evergreen forest catchments (1.63–8.26 ha) in a humid climate (2600 mm y at Maimai in New Zealand; a succession of detailed studies has streamflow generation New water A-horizon lateral flow has a higher matrix flow component than B horizon, possibly as a result of ponding on top of the B horizon.

On the basis of subsequent investigations with electrical conductivity and natural tracers, Pearce et al. (1986) and Sklash et al. (1986) arrivedatadifferentconclusion;theydeducedfromthemeasurementsthatitwasmainly old water throughflow that was responsible for hydrograph generation, and that the flow of new water above the ground surface or below it through the soil matrix or through macropores could not explain the streamflow response. To resolve these discrepancies, a third set of studies was carried out by McDonnell (1990; McDonnell et al., 1991a) in whichachemicaltraceranalysiswassupplementedwithsoilwaterpressureobservations by means of tensiometers installed in near-stream, mid-hollow and upslope positions. It was observed that the soil water pressure response was dependent on storm magnitude, intensity and antecedent water content. For storm events producing peak runoff less than 2 mm h the water appeared to infiltrate downward as a wetting front in the soil matrix without appreciable macropore bypass flow; no water table developed along the slope and the streamflow consisted of old water issuing mainly from the near stream valley bottom groundwater.

The predominance of old water in the streamflow runoff was explained by McDonnell (1990) by the fact that the rapid flow of new rainwater through downward crack macropores backs up into the soil matrix at the soil–bedrock interface, which is still dry; this rapidly causes saturated conditions, and results in the emergence of well-mixed old water from the matrix into lateral pipe macropores and rapid downslope transport (see Figure 11.10). In a fourth set of experiments, Woods and Rowe (1996) dug a trench 60 m long and 1.5 m deep along the toe of a hillslope hollow, with 30 subsurface flow collection points along its length. The outflow from the hillslope was found to be very variable; this led to the conclusion that outflow data from single hillslope throughflow pits should not be extrapolated to an entire hillslope and further (Woods et al., 1997) that this variability depends on wetness and surface topography. The latter conclusion was refuted by McDonnell and associates streamflow generation Fig.11.11 Schematicillustrationofthe rapidsubsurfacestormflow (SF)throughvarioustypesof I n f i l t r a t i o n preferentialflowpaths, pipesandmacropores.The relativeamountsofnew (dashedarrows)andoldwater (solidarrows)inthemixing processdependmainlyonthe B e d r o c k precipitationintensityandon thepre-stormsoilmoisture conditions. (McGlynn al., 2002) on the basis of a fifth set of hillslope-scale tracer measurements with bromide at the same catchment. The main conclusion from that study was that it is not the surface topography, but rather the spatial pattern of the bedrock topography, with local preferential flow and mobile and immobile regions, conditioned by small local depressions in the bedrock, which controls the tracer outflow variability; tracer material and old water may remain trapped temporarily in such depressions and become mobilized only by a new storm event. From measurements in a forested Canadian Shield basin in Ontario, Peters et al. (1995) concluded that preferential flow channels brought the water vertically down, after which it flowed laterally over the bedrock and that practically all the lateral flow occurred within a thin weathered zone near the soil–bedrock interface. The conductivity of this preferential flow layer appeared to be so large that some of the fast flows and peak runoff were suspected to be of the non-Darcy type. The storm runoff in the channel consisted of a mixture of event and pre-event water. This was interpreted to show that thefastinfiltrationoftheeventwatercausedsaturatedsoilconditionsabovethebedrock, which in turn resulted in the downhill flow of both event and pre-event water; moreover, during the hillslope transport, there was ample opportunity for interaction between the event runoff water and the soil matrix. Insummary,thesubsurfacestormflow,observedinseveralofthehillslopeexperiments reviewed here, exhibited the common feature of unimpeded entry by new water from rainfallintothesoil,followedimmediatelybyrapiddownslopeflowthroughpreferential paths, pipes and other macropores; this flow involved mixing with the old water already presentinthesoilprofile(seeFigure11.11),tovaryingdegreesdependingontheintensity of the rain and on the initial moisture status of the soil mantle. Throughflow in a shallow permeable layer In many catchments covered with natural vegetation the soil mantle has a relatively permeable top layer consisting of organic debris and mineral soil with high organic content; typically, this layer has a thickness of only a few tens of centimeters and its bottom interface is characterized by an abrupt decline in hydraulic conductivity in the underlying mineral soil. Thus infiltrating rainwater tends to flow and build up along storm runoff mechanisms this interface and develop a perched water table and fully saturated conditions, although deeper layers may remain partially saturated. In several experimental studies it has been observed that such layers can be effective enough to be a major, and sometimes even the main transport medium for stormflow. As noted above, this type of flow was observed to occur by Bonnell and Gilmour (1978), in conjunction with saturation over- land flow, in a catchment in Queensland. The chemical signatures of hillslope waters in a catchment in Wales made also Chappell et al. (1990) conclude that this can indeed be the dominant mechanism for water and ion transport to lower near-stream riparian zones. Similarly, Jenkins et al. (1994) used natural tracers to characterize rain water, soil water and ground water in a moorland catchment in northeast Scotland. The inter- face between mineral soil layers and the upper organic layers of peaty podsol were identified as preferential pathways. Flow of water in this upper layer was observed to be triggered nearly instantaneously by the onset of the rain, and also to stop nearly as suddenly as the rain ceased; the water in this layer had a chemistry very similar to that of the rain. In the runoff hydrograph, the peak flow was found to be domi- nated by rain and soil water, whereas the recession part was dominated by pre-event groundwater. Although they did not consider this type of flow as being representative of the entire catchment, McDonnell et al. (1991b) did observe it on small portions of the Maimai catchments in New Zealand. During a rain storm event of some 47 mm and with the soil water suctions initially ranging between H 60 and 150 cm water column, most of the water was seen to flow out from the organic soil layer perched on the mineral soil profile;allthewhile,thelowersoilprofileremainedonlypartlysaturated.Morerecently, from an experimental study on seven nested (from 8 to 161 ha) forest catchments in the Catskill Mountains of New York, Brown et al. (1999) concluded that a large fraction of the rapid delivery to the stream took place through this same mechanism. Event water appeared to be most prevalent in the stormflow especially during dry conditions, with relative contributions between 50% and 62% near peak flow. Wavelike mobilization of the water table As illustrated in Figures 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7, for most soils within the nearly saturated capillary fringe, a small change in water content can result in a relatively large change in pore water pressure. This has led to the view that the addition of a very small amount of watertoarelativelymoistsoilcanraisethewatertablerapidly,almostasapressurewave type of propagation, to produce a saturated soil profile. Wherever the profile becomes fully saturated this way, subsurface flow may emerge and saturation excess overland flow is also bound to occur. This type of water table rise may be especially fast in the lower parts of the hillslope and may result in the build up of an emerging groundwater mound, exhibiting greatly increased hydraulic gradients and groundwater discharge to the channel, and forming a partial or variable source area producing saturation excess overland flow as well. Thus the phenomenon is not unlike that depicted in Figure 11.3, except that here the water table rise is presumed to involve very little actual water movement. streamflow generation Phenomena interpreted to be the result of this type of mechanism were observed, for example, in a swampy area by Novakowski and Gillham (1988) and in a grass-covered low relief basin by Abdul and Gillham (1989), both in Ontario. In these studies, the rise of the water table was most pronounced in the near-stream areas. The mechanism has also been inferred to occur in more rugged terrain. During a sprinkler irrigation experiment on a very steep (43%) forested hillslope near Coos Bay in Oregon, Torres et al. (1998) applied a sudden input spike, after the system had been driven to a steady state flow and the soil water pressures were mostly between 0 and cm. They supposed that the timing and magnitude of the pore water pressure and of the dis- charge rate response to this sudden input were much faster than could be expected from advective water movement, and concluded that the fast response was triggered by a pressure wave moving undetected through the unsaturated zone; thus a small amount of rain on a wet soil profile can supposedly result in a rapid rise in the satu- rated zone, with a relatively slight increase in hydraulic gradient and a large increase in hydraulic conductivity. They also observed some preferential flow, but they felt that in this particular soil, this effect was minor compared to that of the soil water retention characteristics. The concept that suction-saturated capillary fringe water can be easily converted into water below the water table, that is from a negative to a positive pressure, by a relatively small amount of rain, is undoubtedly realistic. Clearly, only a little additional water is required to mobilize the soil water, when the soil is already close to saturation. But the importance of this mechanism should be kept in perspective. For example, it can only be expected to be effective when the pore water pressure in the top layers of the soil is arrived at during a drainage phase and not during a wetting phase; as illustrated in Figures 8.14, 8.18 and 8.19, the capillary fringe is usually much smaller in the wetting cycle.Similarly,intheabsenceofanymacroporesorpipes,thewatertable(i.e.thelocus ofatmospheric-orzero-porewaterpressure)canonlybeexpectedtomoverapidlydown a steep slope, if it is already close to the surface. As illustrated in Figure 10.12, the drainable porosity n is smaller when the water table is closer to the surface, that is when ) is smaller. While not a perfect representation, hydraulic groundwater theory, asformulatedbytheBoussinesqequation(10.29)anditslinearizedform(10.134),isalso fully consistent with this. This can be seen by considering the advectivity in Equation c (11.2) it describes the speed of propagation of a given water table height (or of a disturbance ofthewatertableresultingfromrainfall)downtheslope.Thisshowsthat,intheabsence of preferential flow paths, large values of c can result only when the drainable porosity issmall.AsseeninEquation(10.151),thisisequallyconsistentwiththekinematicwave approximation.

On account of the different soil water characteristics in the two layers, for a given water pressure at the interface, at equilibrium the soil water content in the upper layer is normally larger than in the lower coarse-textured layer. As a result, the hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer may be considerably larger than in the lower layer; this is illustrated in Figure 8.26. In such a case infiltrating rain water will not readily enter into this lower layer but will tend to be diverted laterally and may cause a rapid rise in water table further down the slope if the water in the upper layer is already close to suction-saturated. Field observations within the source region of the Tama River in east-central Honshu by Marui (1991; Tanaka, 1996) on a hillslope unit, characterized by a 4 mthick fine-grained loam layer underlain by 15 m thick gravel layer, were con- sistent with this sequence of events. He observed a large-scale groundwater ridge along the steep hillslope. In addition, the air in the underlying partly saturated gravel seemed to be confined by the surrounding groundwater body, and by the saturated zone in the loam layer. In a separate study, Onodera (1991; Tanaka, 1996) inferred that the result- ing air pressure increase may have led to increased groundwater outflow at the slope surface. In conclusion, it stands to reason, that mechanisms related to capillarity can lead to so-called groundwater “ridging” not only in riparian areas, but also along hillslopes, wherever the capillary fringe is already close to the ground surface. However, until now no experiments have demonstrated that by itself this type of phenomenon is related to the hydrograph; thus, whether or not this mechanism can explain large subsurface stormflows remains to be answered.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of subsurface stormflow, what is the primary mechanism by which water moves through the soil mantle in many catchments under natural conditions?", "answer": "The primary mechanism is through the soil mantle, presumably through the soil matrix of the catchment, without exceeding infiltration, allowing precipitation and other input to readily enter into the ground surface."}, {"question": "How do macropores and other preferential flow paths contribute to subsurface flow in forested hill slopes, and what evidence supports their importance?", "answer": "Macropores and other preferential flow paths, such as dead root channels and animal burrows, contribute to subsurface flow by providing rapid transport of water through the soil, bypassing the soil matrix. Evidence from experimental investigations, including chemical and isotopic tracers, has produced ample and incontrovertible evidence for macropore flow and its importance. For instance, studies in a small basin in east-central Honshu and a forested catchment in Tennessee have shown that more than 90% of storm runoff can come from below the ground surface, mainly through pipe flow, and that macropores can conduct new water directly to the stream channel without reaching the water table."}, {"question": "Why do some researchers argue that the distinction between pipe flow and overland flow is meaningless from the perspective of the catchment, and what implications does this have for understanding streamflow generation?", "answer": "Researchers argue that the distinction between pipe flow and overland flow is meaningless because both mechanisms can produce event water, and the flow of new water above the ground surface or below it through the soil matrix or through macropores can contribute to streamflow generation. This has implications for understanding the complexity of streamflow generation, as it suggests that the relative contributions of old and new water to streamflow can vary depending on factors such as precipitation intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, this challenges the traditional view of streamflow generation as being dominated by either overland flow or subsurface flow, and instead highlights the importance of considering the interactions between different flow pathways."}, {"question": "In the context of preferential flow paths, what are the different types of paths that have been observed, and how do they contribute to subsurface flow?", "answer": "Different types of preferential flow paths have been observed, including cracks or fractures resulting from the shrinkage of clay particles during drying episodes, fissured fragipan horizons, and instabilities or fingers at infiltrating wetting fronts in coarse soils. These paths can facilitate the downward movement of water in the profile, and can become permanent features of the profile, each time the soil is being rewetted.

{"paragraph": "11.3.1 General considerations The brief review in Section 11.2 has shown that on the Earth’s land surfaces one can encounter a bewildering range of hydrologic, climatic, topographic and soil conditions, which will favor widely different storm generation mechanisms. These mechanisms can be overland flow due to infiltration excess precipitation, or to saturation excess near the soil surface, resulting either from return outflow from the subsurface, or from rapidly mobilized capillary fringe water in the soil profile to full saturation. On steep slopes overland flow is more likely on converging sections in hollows. The mechanisms can also be subsurface flow of water in a number of different ways. Especially during large rainfallevents,thiscaninvolvedifferenttypesofmacroporesandpreferentialflowpaths, namely as vertical bypass flow to some depth, and then as lateral flow through pipes or through a shallow porous soil layer with high organic content or at the soil bedrock interface. At the same time a slower and less localized throughflow takes place in the soil matrix. Several of these mechanisms have been found to be more than adequate to produce high-intensity runoff events. It is also striking that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and that in many situations they coexist and operate interactively in the production of streamflow; their relative importance then depends on the prevailing streamflow generation conditions, such as initial moisture conditions in the catchment and the magnitude of the precipitation. In some cases the coexistence of different mechanisms can give rise to some unusual phenomena. For instance, under low initial conditions in a watershed in central Cˆ ote d’Ivoire,Masiyandimaetal.(2003)observeddouble-peakedhydrographsresultingfrom the same rainfall burst; the first peak, which occurred while it rained, was produced by therainfallonthesaturatedvalleybottom;thesecondpeak,whichcameminutestohours after the first, resulted from the rain that had fallen on the area surrounding the valley bottom and that had traveled to the stream channel by subsurface flow. All this underscores again the extreme complexity of the stream generation process. These observations suggest that a single unifying runoff model may not be possible nor even desirable, and they have profound implications for the development of modeling strategies for predictive purposes in applied hydrology. Identification of major mechanisms Inordertokeeptheformulationsufficientlysimpleandparsimonious,itmaybenecessary toidentifyandincludeonlythedominantmechanismsforanygivensetofconditions,and toacceptsomeinevitableuncertaintyresultingfromtheomissionoftheremainingminor mechanisms. On the basis of a knowledge of these local conditions, the analyst must then decide which mechanisms are the major ones that must be considered to represent a particular catchment. The insight gained by the recent field observations can also give some guidance in this. For instance, different kinds of subsurface flow can be assumed to dominate the runoff process in humid areas with an active vegetation. Well-developed mineralsoilsundoubtedlyfavorthedevelopmentofpreferentialflowpaths,whereasthin porous soils with organic litter probably lead to shallow lateral flow of the perched water above the less permeable soil or bedrock. Wetland areas near the stream may allow rapid mobilization or ridging of the water table, and the development of partial and variable sourceareas,onwhichsaturationexcessoverlandflowcantakeplace.Infiltrationexcess overland flow will be prevalent during large precipitation events on unvegetated surfaces in arid regions and in areas subject to intense human activities. Objectives of the analysis This wide variety in possible mechanisms also means that, in the development of mod- eling strategies for engineering and other applied purposes, for a given catchment it may be advisable to adopt different formulations depending on the objectives of the analysis. For example, the prediction of disastrous flash flooding, under extreme precipitation conditions, may require an entirely different approach from those needed to describe solutetransportandwaterqualityintheenvironment,toanalyzepossibleclimatechange scenarios under more normal flow regimes, or to assess the potential for erosion or land- slides. For flood prediction, mainly the flows at a certain point along the river may be of interest;forclimatechangescenarios,surface–atmosphereinteractionsareofparamount importance; and for water quality purposes it may be crucial to know the pathways, in order to determine the fate and transport of admixtures and water pollutants; finally, summary of mechanisms erosion and landslide hazards tend to be related to the pore water pressure distribution and the local flow velocities. Appropriate parameter values But even for the same formulation, it may also be necessary to adopt different parameter values depending on the flow regime. The formulation of river flow usually requires dif- ferent values of the roughness parameter in the Gauckler–Manning or Ch´ ezy equations, dependingonwhetheritislowflowwithintheregularchannelorhighflowwithflooding outside the banks. Similarly, in the description of hillslope outflow by some of the sub- surfaceparameterizationsofChapter10,theappropriatevaluesoftheeffectivehydraulic conductivity k and of the thickness of the flow region , used to represent stormflow conditions with active macropores, will be considerably larger than those appropriate for conditions of baseflow, after the water tables have subsided and many of the macro- pores in the upper soil layers have emptied and are no longer active. Actually, because of the high flow velocities, subsurface stormflows may not be of the Darcy type, and it may be necessary to use Forchheimer’s Equation (8.34) with an additional transmission parameter beside the hydraulic conductivity. Ultimately, the performance, in a general sense, of any kind of parameterization and of the resulting model, has to be judged on the basis of its ability to simulate or replicate observations of the variables of interest.

{"paragraph": "11.3.2 How to put it all together? Distributed versus lumped approach As already explained in Chapter 1, scale is the appropriate criterion to classify the differentmethodologies.Accordingly,onecandistinguishtwogeneralclassesofmodels that have been used in the past to simulate streamflow generation. In the distributed models, also called models, the computational scales are much smaller runoff routing than the flow domain characterizing the catchment, whereas in the lumped models the computational scale is essentially of the same order as that of the catchment. The main feature of the distributed approach is that the basin outflow is obtained by tracking the water through its different transport phases in the basin interior. In brief, these phases are surface and subsurface transport into the stream channel network, in response to precipitation after it reaches the ground surface, and the subsequent open channel flow to the basin outlet; between precipitation episodes the basin outflow is dominated by baseflow and evaporation processes. The different mechanisms in each of these transport phases may be described by combining some of the formulations of the relevantprocesses,aspresentedinChapters2–10.Theseformulationsinvariablyinvolve a number of assumptions neglecting certain aspects of the flow, which are considered to be less important; this means that they can be only simplified representations of reality. The distributed approach has been receiving increasing acceptance in recent years with the advent of digital computation and with the growing availability of higher-resolution streamflow generation data from digital terrain and other geographical information systems; rapid advances continue to be reported in the literature. Among the main advantages of distributed models one can note that they allow the exploration of the consequences of various simplifying assumptions; as a result, they can lead to a better understanding of the various pathways and of the interplay between the main processes and related aspects of complex hydrologic systems in the real world. They can also be useful in the prediction of outflow from headwater catchments, pro- vided their parameters can be determined. But this requirement subsumes also one of their main shortcomings. Ideally, the parameters should be determined a priori, that is independentlyfromthemodel’sperformance.Inmanycases,however,thisisimpossible andtheparametersmustbeestimatedbycalibration.Butthen,distributedmodelstendto containsomanyparametersthatitbecomespracticallyimpossibletoestimatethemallin objectiveandphysicallyconsistentways.Anothermajordrawbackisthattheunderlying mathematical rigor of the parameterizations of the model components may instill in the practitioneraconfidenceandasenseofrealismabouttheirperformance,thattheydonot deserve, on account of the many simplifications and uncertainties involved. As a result, the limitations of such models may not be fully understood by uninitiated users and they may be applied to situations for which they were not intended. In contrast, the lumped models, whose computational scales are of the same order of magnitude as the catchment scales, rely on fewer parameters, which are generally easier toestimatefromtheavailabledata.Therefore,theyareeasiertoapplyinbasinoutletflow simulationsforpredictionandforecastingpurposes.Unfortunately,asthecomputational scaleincreases,itbecomesincreasinglydifficulttogiveaphysicalinterpretationtothese parameters, in the sense of the processes described in Chapters 2–10. This means that it is usually impossible topredict changes in these parameters,asthe catchment undergoes physical changes, such as those resulting from an evolving land use or changing climate. Another drawback is that even when the catchment characteristics remain unchanged, catchment-scale parameters are incapable of accommodating spatial variability of the input(e.g.rainfall)andoftheflowprocesses(e.g.infiltrationandevaporation).Moreover, it is impossible to use this approach to describe the detailed flow paths required in the predictionofpollutanttransportorerosion.Inspiteofalltheseshortcomings,thelumped approach continues to be useful in the prediction of streamflow for certain operational and design purposes. Specific implementations of this approach are further treated in detail in Chapter 12. Again, in closing this review, it should be understood that, although a classification into distributed and lumped models is useful to bring some order in the multitude of possible approaches, it is also somewhat artificial. Comparison of the different methods treated in Chapters 5–10 has made it clear that the lumped kinematic approach is merely the simplest extreme in a continuous range of complexity levels, which can be applied in up-scaling the analysis from the finest resolution of the full space- and time-dependent conservation equations of momentum, energy and mass to the coarsest resolution, that is the scale of the catchment itself. However, the level of model complexity necessary for a specific application is still not well known; nor is it clear what scenarios warrant the use of more complex models or under what conditions a distributed model will consistently references outperform lumped models. In other words, there is still no general consensus regarding the optimal simplifying assumptions that are most appropriate to describe streamflow generation under a given set of conditions. Although it could be argued that there never will be a consensus, this field is in an active state of development and rapid advances continue to be made. REFERENCES Abdul, A. S. and Gillham, R. W.

The basic philosophy of this type of approach is that the physical processes are assumed to take place at the scale of the catchment, without consideration for the detailed subscale processes or for the intricacies of the flow paths inside the watershed. In a sense, this is analogous with the view espoused in continuum mechanics orthermodynamics(albeitintheirownrespectivescaleranges),whereonlythe“macro” or “everyday” properties of the fluids are taken into account, without consideration of their properties at the molecular or nuclear scales. Because by far most applications of the lumped approach in the past have been based on the assumptions of linearity and stationarity, these will be treated first and in greatest detail.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what is the primary distinction between distributed and lumped models?", "answer": "The primary distinction between distributed and lumped models lies in their computational scales relative to the catchment scale, with distributed models having smaller computational scales and lumped models having scales of the same order as the catchment."}, {"question": "How do distributed models simulate streamflow generation, and what are the key phases involved in this process?", "answer": "Distributed models simulate streamflow generation by tracking water through its different transport phases in the basin interior, including surface and subsurface transport into the stream channel network in response to precipitation, and subsequent open channel flow to the basin outlet. Between precipitation episodes, the basin outflow is dominated by baseflow and evaporation processes. These phases are described by combining formulations of relevant processes, which involve assumptions and simplifications of the flow."}, {"question": "Why are distributed models considered advantageous in understanding hydrologic systems, and what are some of their limitations?", "answer": "Distributed models are advantageous because they allow for the exploration of the consequences of various simplifying assumptions, leading to a better understanding of the pathways and interplay between main processes in complex hydrologic systems. However, a significant limitation is the difficulty in determining their parameters objectively and physically consistently, as they often contain too many parameters to be estimated reliably. This can lead to overconfidence in the model's performance due to the underlying mathematical rigor, which may not fully capture the uncertainties and simplifications involved."}, {"question": "In what scenarios are lumped models preferred over distributed models, and what are their main drawbacks?", "answer": "Lumped models are preferred for their simplicity and ease of application in basin outlet flow simulations for prediction and forecasting purposes, especially when the computational scale is of the same order as the catchment scale. However, their main drawbacks include the difficulty in giving physical interpretation to their parameters as the computational scale increases, making it challenging to predict changes in these parameters due to physical changes in the catchment, such as evolving land use or climate change. Additionally, lumped models cannot accommodate spatial variability of input and flow processes, limiting their use in detailed flow path predictions required for pollutant transport or erosion studies."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions of linearity and stationarity influence the application of lumped models in hydrology?", "answer": "The assumptions of linearity and stationarity have been the basis for most past applications of lumped models in hydrology, allowing for simpler mathematical formulations. However, these assumptions can limit the model's ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships and dynamic changes in hydrologic systems, potentially leading to inaccuracies in predictions, especially under changing environmental conditions."}, {"question": "What is the current state of understanding regarding the optimal simplifying assumptions for describing streamflow generation under different conditions?", "answer": "There is currently no general consensus on the optimal simplifying assumptions for describing streamflow generation under a given set of conditions. The field is in an active state of development, with rapid advances being made. The choice of model complexity and simplifying assumptions depends on the specific application and the scale of interest, highlighting the need for continued research to better understand the trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and applicability."}, {"question": "In the context of distributed modeling, why is it challenging to determine model parameters objectively?", "answer": "Determining model parameters objectively in distributed modeling is challenging because the models tend to contain many parameters, making it practically impossible to estimate them all in an objective and physically consistent manner. Ideally, parameters should be determined a priori, independently of the model's performance, but in many cases, this is impossible, and parameters must be estimated by calibration, which can introduce subjectivity and uncertainty."}, {"question": "How do distributed and lumped models differ in their ability to accommodate spatial variability of input and flow processes?", "answer": "Distributed models are better suited to accommodate spatial variability of input (e.g., rainfall) and flow processes (e.g., infiltration and evaporation) because they operate at smaller computational scales, allowing for a more detailed representation of the catchment's heterogeneity. In contrast, lumped models, with their larger computational scales, struggle to capture this variability, treating the catchment as a homogeneous unit, which can lead to oversimplification of the hydrologic processes."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using lumped models for predicting pollutant transport or erosion in catchments?", "answer": "Using lumped models for predicting pollutant transport or erosion in catchments is generally not advisable because these models cannot provide the detailed flow paths required for such predictions. Lumped models are better suited for predicting streamflow at the catchment outlet and do not have the spatial resolution needed to accurately model the transport of pollutants or the processes leading to erosion, which require a more detailed understanding of the flow paths and processes within the catchment."}]}
{"paragraph": "12.1.1 Basic concept Definition The unit hydrograph, or unit graph, can be defined as the hydrograph of unit volume of storm runoff produced by a unit volume of uniform (in space and in time) intensity excess rainfall over a unit period , with the basic assumptions of and D linearity time invariance. As defined here, the unit hydrograph is the response function of a linear system, which is treated in more general terms in the Appendix, and can be denoted by respectively, the storm runoff per unit of catchment area and the intensity of excess rainfallorotherinputperunitcatchmentarea,whichdirectlyproducesthisstormrunoff; note that in some practical applications, the determination of and may require the abstraction of baseflow and of the interception or deep infiltration of the precipitation. According to the definition of Equation (A9), in the present context the assumption of linearity or superposition means that the hydrograph, resulting from any input pattern of rainfall or snowmelt, can be built up from separate unit hydrographs by superposition, that is, after scaling them in magnitude and after sequencing them in time. In light of the definition (A10), the assumption of invariance or stationarity means that the runoff from a given catchment due to a given input pattern is the same, regardless of the particular circumstances; thus there are no effects or feedbacks resulting from current conditions (e.g. season) or antecedent input during the event.

Example 12.1. Application of unit hydrograph To illustrate this concept, Figure 12.1 shows an example of a 2 hunit hydrograph for a certain catchment; the numerical values are listed in Table 12.1. This hydrograph represents the storm runoff from the catchment, produced by a rainfall excess which has a unit volume, i.e. 1 cm, and a unit duration 2h. To achieve this unit volume, the rainfall intensity is of necessity 0.5 cm over the 2 h period. This unit hydrograph can now be used to calculate the storm runoff produced by any pattern of spatially uniform excess rainfall. Consider the following sequence: 1 cm for 0 2h, 2 cm for 2 4 h, and 1.5 cm for 4 6h. The t x t x t first rainfall burst, i.e. 1 cm has twice the intensity of the input that produces the unit hydrograph; therefore it produces a storm runoff hydrograph, whose magnitude is twice that of the unit hydrograph. The second burst, i.e. 2 cm has four times the intensity of the input that produces the unit hydrograph, and so on. The ordinates of the resulting three hydrographs are then added to yield the storm hydrograph, as illustrated in Figure 12.2. Practical limitations The assumptions of linearity and invariance have their limitations, and the requirements of uniformity are rarely met. For example, the assumption of linearity implies that the stationary linear response Table12.1Valuesofthe2hunithydrographusedinExample12.1 h−1) h−1) 0 0.0000 6.5 0.0654 0.5 0.0080 7 0.0477 1 0.0414 7.5 0.0342 1.5 0.0963 8 0.0242 2 0.1610 8.5 0.0169 2.5 0.2195 9 0.0118 3 0.2471 9.5 0.0081 3.5 0.2433 10 0.0055 4 0.2190 10.5 0.0037 4.5 0.1851 11 0.0025 5 0.1494 11.5 0.0017 5.5 0.1164 12 0.0011 6 0.0883 12.5 0.0008 Fig.12.2 Exampleofthestormrunoff(heavyline)calculatedbymeansofthe2hunithydrographshownin Figure12.1,resultingfromastormwithexcessprecipitationratesof1cmh−1 for0 2 h,2cm h−1 h,and1.5cmh−1 for2 4 for4 6 h;thesesuccessivepulsesandtheirresponsesare indicatedbya,bandc.Therespectivevolumesare2,4and3cmoverthecatchmentarea. time scales of runoff remain independent of the magnitude of the input. This assumption is acceptable as long as the flow rates do not deviate too much from some average or characteristic values. However, nonlinearities can be expected to show up when the flow rate magnitudes of interest cover a wide range; this holds especially true over smaller catchments. For instance, in the case of free surface flow, the Ch´ ezy and GM equations, (5.39) and (5.41), indicate that the velocity depends on the water depth. This means that the more water is flowing in the rills, gutters and creek channels of the basin, the streamflow response at the catchment scale May 27, 1938 P=12.07 cm Sept. 2, 1941 P=6.73 cm Apr. 17, 1941 P=4.95 cm Oct. 22, 1941 P=3.35 cm July 20, 1948 P=2.41 cm 60 80 120 140 Time, t (min) Illustrationofthenonlinearfeaturesoftheunitresponseu(Du;t)ofaverysmall(0.11km2) Fig.12.3 x P)varies agriculturalcatchmentinIllinois,whentheexcessprecipitationinputrate (denotedhereas overawiderangebetween2.4and12.1cmh−1.Theunitduration wasnearlythesameforallfive casesandrangedbetween10and14min;theindicatedtimeisfromthestartoftheexcess precipitation.(AfterMinshall, 1960.) shorter the time to peak of the outflow hydrograph will be, and thus also the higher the peak flow rate will tend to be. This type of nonlinearity is illustrated in Figure 12.3. The unit hydrographs were derived from field data in a study by Minshall (1960) on a small agricultural catchment of 0.11 The durations were nearly the same for all five cases and ranged between 10 and 14 min, but the rainfall rates changed five-fold over a range between 24 and 121 mm This type of response may be called superlinear. However, watersheds need not always behave this way. For instance, in the extreme case ofalargeflood,whenthewaterspillsoverthebanksofthechannelontothefloodplain,it may happen that the flow is retarded by the larger roughness of the flood plain obstacles; the peak is then likely to arrive later than predicted by the unit hydrograph obtained from flows under more moderate flow conditions. This would be a case of sublinear response. The requirement of a spatially uniform rainfall input imposes an upper limit on the catchment area; for practical applications, an upper limit of the order of 1800 has been suggested by O’Kelly (1955).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis, what is the definition of a unit hydrograph?", "answer": "The unit hydrograph is defined as the hydrograph of unit volume of storm runoff produced by a unit volume of uniform intensity excess rainfall over a unit period, with assumptions of linearity and time invariance."}, {"question": "Why are the assumptions of linearity and invariance crucial in the application of unit hydrographs?", "answer": "The assumptions of linearity and invariance are crucial because they allow for the superposition of separate unit hydrographs to predict the hydrograph resulting from any input pattern of rainfall or snowmelt.

For instance, in free surface flow, the velocity depends on the water depth, leading to a shorter time to peak of the outflow hydrograph and a higher peak flow rate as more water flows in the channels. This type of nonlinearity is illustrated in Figure 12.3, where the unit hydrographs derived from field data show a superlinear response. However, watersheds may also exhibit sublinear responses, such as when the flow is retarded by floodplain obstacles during large floods."}, {"question": "In what ways can the concept of unit hydrographs be limited by practical considerations?", "answer": "The concept of unit hydrographs can be limited by practical considerations such as the requirement of spatially uniform rainfall input, which imposes an upper limit on the catchment area.

Each unit hydrograph represents the storm runoff from a catchment produced by a rainfall excess with a unit volume and unit duration. By scaling and sequencing these unit hydrographs according to the input pattern, the resulting storm hydrograph can be calculated, as illustrated in the example where a storm with excess precipitation rates of 1 cm/h for 0-2 hours, 2 cm/h for 2-4 hours, and 1.5 cm/h for 4-6 hours is used to calculate the storm runoff."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the limitations of the unit hydrograph concept in hydrological applications?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the limitations of the unit hydrograph concept because they can significantly impact the accuracy of predictions. For instance, nonlinearities can lead to errors in predicting peak flow rates and times to peak, while the requirement of spatially uniform rainfall input can limit the applicability of the concept to larger catchments. By understanding these limitations, hydrologists can better assess the reliability of their predictions and develop more accurate models that account for the complexities of real-world hydrological systems."}, {"question": "In the context of unit hydrograph theory, what is the significance of the work by Sherman (1932a, b)?", "answer": "The work by Sherman (1932a, b) introduced the concept of the unit hydrograph as a method of extending available data to predict floods resulting from more complex and higher intensity storms than those on record.

{"paragraph": "12.1.2 Extensions of original approach: alternative response functions S hydrograph This type of response function results from a uniform input of unit intensity, which con- tinues indefinitely. Thus with the same assumptions, as those used in the definition of the unit hydrograph, the S hydrograph can be obtained by superposing the unit hydro- graphsresultingfromanuninterruptedsequenceofunitrainfallvolumesofunitduration. Observe that for a unit duration the input intensity is of necessity ), if the total stationary linear response Fig.12.4 ConstructionoftheShydrographwiththeexampleunithydrographshownin Figure12.1.Several unithydrographsaretime-shiftedbyanamount 2handthensummed;thisresult(thinline) = 1/Du = simulatestheoutflowratefromthecatchment,causedbyasteadyuniforminputrateof 0.5cmh−1.TheS-hydrographforasteadyinputrateofunitmagnitudeof1cmh−1 (heavyline)is obtainedbymultiplyingthissumby2(i.e. input is to be a unit volume. Therefore, the superposed unit hydrographs must be scaled, that is divided by this intensity (or multiplied by ), to obtain the S hydrograph for a continuous input of unit intensity. The main feature of the S hydrograph is that it allows the determination of the unit hydrograph for any other adopted unit period, say . This is accomplished graphically by time-shifting the S hydrograph time units to the right and by then subtracting thetime-shiftedfromtheoriginalShydrograph.Again,however,becausetheunitvolume (cid:3) (cid:3) musthaveanintensityequalto(1/D inputpulseofduration ),theresultingdifference must be multiplied by this amount to produce the output resulting from a unit volume input. Accordingly, the unit hydrograph for the new unit period is (cid:3) (cid:3) D(cid:3) in which (t) is the S hydrograph. Example 12.2.

If the = 0.5h,theoperationdescribedby unithydrographissoughtforaunitperiodof,say, Equation (12.1) is performed. As illustrated in Figure 12.5, first an S curve, time-shifted byhalfanhour,issubtractedfromtheoriginalone.Aninputrateof lasting for half an hour produces a total volume of 0.5 cm. Therefore this difference must be scaled by multiplying it by 2, to obtain a unit runoff volume of 1 cm. The instantaneous unit hydrograph This is the outflow hydrograph resulting from an input of unit volume placed instanta- neouslyanduniformlyovertheentirecatchmentsurface,againundertheassumptionsof linearity and time-invariance. Clark (1945) was probably the first to apply this concept in runoff computations. As shown in the Appendix, an instantaneous input can be repre- sented by a Dirac delta function. Hence the instantaneous unit hydrograph is in fact the impulse response or Green’s function of the catchment. In the notation of the Appendix, it can be represented by u(t). It also means that the outflow from the catchment, in response to a uniform rainfall input of intensity x(t), can be obtained by means of For instance in the case of Equation (A14) this is = x(τ) − τ)dτ y(t) u(t (12.2) the catchment. Recall that y(t) is the storm runoff rate per unit area of catchment; stationary linear response Fig.12.6 Convolutionoperationwithaninstantaneous unithydrographu u(t),astheanalogof thesummationshowninFigure12.2,inthe Du dt y andu limitas 0.(Thevaluesof arenotdrawntoscale.)(Seealso FigureA5.) hence,forastreamflowrate Q(t)attheoutletofacatchmentofarea A,thefunction represents so that it has the dimensions just like x(t). This means that the dimensions of the unit response function in Equation (12.2) are [u] [T corresponding, for example, with the units of cm per hour of runoff per cm of rainfall input. In the operation represented by the convolution integral (12.2), 0 is defined as the start of the input rate x(t). At any given value of time t, the total output rate is the result of all past inputs from the start of the input at 0 until t, weighted at each instant with the unit response, as indicated in Figure 12.6, with the argument (t In the integration is the dummy time variable of integration, and is treated as a constant. (A more mathematical illustration of this or is given convolution folding in Figure A5.) Relationships between these different response functions The instantaneous unit hydrograph u(t) can be used to derive the finite duration unit hydrograph u(D ;t) by applying Equation (12.2) with the following input This yields, say, for = − τ)dτ After putting (t s, so that Equation (12.4) becomes This indicates that the finite duration unit hydrograph at time is the average of the instantaneous unit hydrograph taken over the period between (t ) and t.

Because of this one-to-one relationship between the finite duration unit hydrograph and the instantaneous unit hydrograph, no distinction need be made between the two, and both can be referred to as unit response function. The instantaneous unit hydrograph can also be used to derive the S hydrograph by simply applying Equation (12.2) with a constant unit input rate, x(t) starting at 0, that is a unit step function as defined in Equation (A8), or = − τ)dτ (t) u(t (12.6) rule (A2) shows readily that the instantaneous unit hydrograph is the slope of the S hydrograph. Actually this also follows directly from Equation (12.1), as can be seen by letting the unit duration approach zero, or in the limit as 0 u(t) (12.7)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis, what is the S hydrograph, and how is it derived?", "answer": "The S hydrograph is a type of response function resulting from a uniform input of unit intensity that continues indefinitely.

This concept, introduced by Clark in 1945, allows for the computation of runoff from the catchment in response to any uniform rainfall input intensity x(t) through the convolution integral, as shown in Equation (12.2). The implications of this are significant, as it provides a powerful tool for predicting runoff rates and volumes from catchments under various rainfall scenarios, which is crucial for flood control, water resource management, and understanding catchment behavior."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the instantaneous unit hydrograph and the S hydrograph, and how can one be derived from the other?", "answer": "The instantaneous unit hydrograph can be used to derive the S hydrograph by applying the convolution integral with a constant unit input rate.

This relationship highlights the interconnectedness of different hydrological response functions and demonstrates how understanding one can provide insights into others, facilitating more comprehensive hydrological analyses."}, {"question": "How does the derivation of unit hydrographs for different unit periods contribute to hydrological modeling and water resource management?", "answer": "The ability to derive unit hydrographs for different unit periods is crucial for hydrological modeling and water resource management. It allows for the adaptation of hydrological models to different time scales and rainfall patterns, enhancing the accuracy of runoff predictions and the effectiveness of water management strategies. By understanding how catchments respond to rainfall at various time scales, hydrologists can better design flood control measures, manage water supply systems, and predict the impacts of climate change on water resources, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making in water resource management."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological response functions, what is the significance of the convolution integral, and how is it applied?", "answer": "The convolution integral is significant in hydrological response functions as it represents the process of combining the effects of past rainfall inputs on the current runoff, weighted by the unit response of the catchment. It is applied by integrating the product of the input rate x(t) and the unit response function u(t) over time, as shown in Equation (12.2).

{"paragraph": "12.2.1 From available data Simple storm events In principle, it should be relatively straightforward to determine the unit hydrograph, whenever the rainfall occurs as a single burst of acceptably uniform intensity and of a suitable duration, and is accompanied by an easily identifiable streamflow hydrograph. This may be done by first subtracting the baseflow from the observed hydrograph and by identification of linear response functions thenscalingtheremainderhydrographtothedesiredunitvolume,thatisbydividingitby the observed excess rainfall depth. Trial and error may be required in the determination of the baseflow and of the precipitation losses, to ensure that the excess rainfall volume equalsthestormrunoffvolumeoverthecatchmentarea.Severalunithydrographsderived from different storm events of a similar duration can be averaged in order to obtain a more representative result. If necessary, a common duration can also be obtained by means of their respective S hydrographs. Complex storm events More often than not, precipitation events do not have a uniform intensity in time and the resulting runoff hydrograph may be quite irregular. The unit hydrograph must then be estimated by considering its mathematical operation in some detail. Precipitation and also streamflow data are usually given with discrete time steps. According to Equation (A18), the discrete analog of the convolution integral is y(t) x(k (12.8) inwhichτ = n(cid:3)τ(≤ t)isthetimeofthelastinputpulsepriortothedesignatedresponse τ = (cid:3)τ time t.

Clearly, the number of ordinates of each of the functions must satisfy 1 (12.12) which is illustrated in the following example. Example 12.3. Numerical convolution Consider a rainfall event consisting of 3 rainfall input pulses, and 6 measured output hydrograph ordinates; this implies a discretized response function with 4 ordinates.

In the identification of the response characteristics of the system, as formu- ,u ,...,u that need to be determined. Because there are equations available, the sys- tem is over-determined. Nevertheless, one might be tempted to determine these identification of linear response functions u-values algebraically by forward substitution, for example with Equation (12.11) as ,u ,...,u and so on for . This could also be done by backward substitution, starting with as follows ,u ,...,u andsoonfortheremainingvaluesu .Thisprocedurewouldbefineifthe data were accurate and if the real system in nature were indeed to perform as formulated in these equations. Unfortunately, hydrologic data are invariably subject to considerable error and natural catchments tend to exhibit some nonlinear and non-stationary features in their response characteristics. Therefore, an optimal solution must be sought, which makes use of all available equations. Among the more common solution methods of a set of equations like (12.9) and (12.11) are those based on the least squares criterion (see Snyder, 1955) and on other mathematical programming techniques (see Deininger, 1969; Diskin and Boneh, 1973, Box al., 1994). The method of least squares The underlying criterion in this method consists of the minimization of the sum of the squares of the differences between the measured data and the calculated values in Equation (12.9). These differences are called the residuals, say . A simple example will illustrate how their squares can be minimized. Example 12.4. Application of least squares method Consider again the simple case described by Equation (12.13) and illustrated in Figure 12.8.

These constitute a system of four linear equa- tions for the four unknown values of , which can readily be solved. The technique may also be used in the solution of even more complex cases; various algorithms involving operations of matrix transposition and inversion are available and can be found in textbooks on numerical analysis. Transform methods of identification Beside the direct solution methods of Equations (12.9) and (12.11), numerous other methodsareavailabletoderiveoptimalu values.Inseveralofthese,byusingadifferent usually algebraic, relationship between the three is obtained, which is more tractable for computation than the convolution integral (12.2) or (12.9). In the method of moments, the functions are characterized by their moments. The optimal values, or the optimal constants in the function, that is used to describe u(t), are determined such that the moments of the calculated output function are equal to the moments of the observed output function y(t). In principle, this method is based on the application of the theorem aredescribedasFourierseriesexpansions.Theoptimalu valuesortheconstantsinu(t), are determined such that the constants of the Fourier series expansion of the calculated output are exactly the same as those of the observed output. In Fourier and Laplace transform methods, the functions are formulated, respectively, in the frequency domain and in the (i.e. the Laplace transform) domain. A review of the application of many of the identification methods investigated in earlier years in catchment hydrology has been presented by Dooge (1973). In practice, however, some of these techniques of direct identification from available data result in response functions, which can be quite sensitive to small errors in the measurements, exhibiting such “non-physical” features as severe oscillations or negative values.

{"paragraph": "12.2.2 More concise parameterizations by linear runoff routing The data needed to derive the unit hydrograph for a given basin are not always available. Therefore, it should be no surprise that over the years many attempts have been made to develop methods enabling the prediction of this unit response function from basin characteristics. The goal of these studies was to derive unit hydrographs for ungaged watersheds from maps and from some other readily available physical attributes. In one class of methods, empirical equations and empirical curves were used to describe the unit hydrograph, with parameters in terms of basin characteristics. However, because of their strictly empirical nature, their applicability tends to be limited to the region where they were developed, and they will not be considered any further here. Inanotherclassofmethods,whichareofamorefundamentalinterest,varioustheoret- ical forms of the response function were proposed by postulating different combinations of model elements, which replicate the most important flow mechanisms to transform identification of linear response functions the precipitation into steamflow. In general, the response function is derived by routing a lumped rainfall excess input through a number of elements of storage and translation, whicharepatternedafterthedifferentprocessesasdescribedinChapters2–10;therefore, such methods might, in a certain sense, be considered physically based. One of the main advantagesofthesemethodsis,thattheresultingresponsefunctionsusuallyrequireonly few parameters; this makes them more general and also easier to calibrate. On the down- side, however, since their computational scale is so large, the correspondence with the actualphysicalprocessesisnotalwaysclear.Indeed,asthecomputationalscalebecomes much larger than the variability scales of the basin, the parameters gradually lose their original physical meaning. Because of this ambiguity, these types of parameterizations have also been called conceptual models (see Dooge, 1973). Linear translatory transport: the Rational Method This is probably the earliest attempt to relate precipitation with the resulting runoff from a catchment. Evidently (Dooge, 1957), the method was pioneered already some 150 years ago by Mulvany (1850) in Ireland, but versions of it are still being used today in the design of small drainage structures. The underlying concept of the method is that each catchment has a (constant) concentration, , which is the time needed for time of t the water to flow from the most distant point of the catchment to the outlet. The peak dischargerate takesplacewhentheentirecatchmentarea Acontributestotheoutflow, and this occurs at the time after the onset of the rain at 0.

The equation proposed by Kirpich (1940), on the basis of Ramser’s (1927) data, is often quoted; this can be expressed as follows (cid:5) (cid:6) 0.062 (12.21) where is in hours, is the length of the main channel from the furthest divide to the outlet in km, and is the average (dimensionless) slope, that is the ratio of the fall of the main channel from the divide to the outlet and its length. As an alternative for very small catchments, the time of concentration can also be taken as the time to equilibrium (6.20) obtained analytically by means of the kinematic wave method. For turbulent flow, identification of linear response functions with the Gauckler–Manning formula (5.41), one has and so that Equation (6.20) can be written as (cid:5) (cid:6) (n0.60P −0.40) It is remarkable that the powers of and are not very different from those in the strictly empirical formula (12.21).

Recall also that on the basis of experimental data on reported in the literature, McCuen and Spiess (1995) recommended that Equation (12.22) should not be used when ) exceeds Next, a decision must be made regarding the return period of the event . This is usuallytakenastheexpectedlifetimeofthestructure.Togiveanidea,ASCEandWPCF (1982) suggest, depending on the economic justification, typical values of 5 y for storm sewers in residential areas, 20 y in commercial and high value districts, and 50 y or more for flood protection works. Finally, with the duration of the rainfall event, i.e. D, and the return period of the design storm, i.e. , both decided upon, the intensity can be determined from the available intensity–frequency–duration data for the site. Figure 3.16 shows an example of such data. If deemed necessary, the rainfall intensity at the point can be converted to an area value by such means as illustrated in Figure 3.14. Thejustificationforequatingthetimeofconcentrationwiththedurationoftheselected design rainfall event is illustrated in Figure 12.9. This shows that, if it is assumed that , only part of the drainage area can contribute to the outflow. On the other hand, if one assumes that , the intensity obtained for this longer duration, would be too small; indeed, as illustrated in Figure 3.16, for a given return period , the rainfall rate decreases with increasing duration D. Thus to allow the entire drainage area to contribute to the outflow rate, and to obtain the maximal intensity for the selected return period, it is reasonable to put . variations in the engineering literature are based on the notion that storm runoff consists primarily of overland flow. As discussed in Chapter 11, on hillslopes with permeable soils, this is often a tenuous assumption, as most of the runoff takes place through subsurface flow paths. If for such situations Darcy’s law is valid, the kinematic flow speed (10.151) yields the following time of concentration ,k αareeffectivevalues inwhich isthehillslopelength(seeFigure10.26),andn and of the drainable porosity, the hydraulic conductivity and the slope angle, respectively. streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.9 Intheapplicaticationofthe rationalmethodtocalculatethe peakflow,thedurationofthe designstormistakenasthetimeof D tc.Ifthe concentration,or durationwereshorter,sothat D tc,onlypartofthecatchment wouldcontributetotherunoff;on theotherhandifalongerduration D tc,the wereassumed,sothat designrainfallrate,derivedfrom availableintensity–duration information(e.g.Figure3.16), mightbetoosmallfortheadopted designreturnperiod Linear translation with the time–area method The rational method provides only the peak discharge rate, and over the years attempts have been made to broaden the approach, in order to allow a more complete description of the entire hydrograph including its rise and subsequent recession. This was done, for instance by Hawken and Ross (1921), who considered the effects of the drainage area shape and of the time variation of the storm rainfall. The effects of the shape of the drainageareaandofthedrainagenetwereaccountedforbytheintroductionofthetime– ofthetraveltimesinthebasintotheoutlet.Thisfunctionisobtainedbyfirstestablishing atraveltimeforeachpointinthebasin,andbythensketchingisochrones,whicharelines connectingpointsofequaltraveltime.Thetime–areafunction (t)isaplotofthe relative areas (as fractions of the total basin area) between different isochrones (equally spaced in time), against their respective travel times; thus it is the density function of the travel times to the outlet (Figure 12.10). In this approach, the time variation of the rainfall input was accounted for by a procedure, which, as pointed out by Nash (1958), was in fact a numerical convolution operation. Just like in the standard version of the Rational Method, the basic assumption is that the entire catchment is equivalent with a plane on which the rainfall is transported to the outlet by translation. Because the system is linear, the transformation mechanism is that of a linear kinematic channel as formulated in Chapter 5. Since it is normalized, identification of linear response functions Ar Ar(t),asan Fig.12.10 Sketchofatime–areafunction extensionoftherationalmethod.Thedashed linesonthecatchmentmaprepresentlinesof equaltraveltimeorisochrones.

Hence, the time–area function (t) is the unit response function of this type of catchment (see Figure 12.11), and the outflow resulting from a rainfall input x(t) is given by Equation (12.2), or = x(τ) − τ)dτ y(t) (t (12.24) Note with Dooge (1973) that, while this approach made use of an instantaneous unit hydrograph in the form of the time–area function, it predated the formal invention of the unit hydrograph by Sherman (1932a,b) by about a decade. But the time–area approach never gained wide acceptance, probably because it takes insufficient account of storage mechanisms in the basin. In natural drainage basins precipitation cannot be immediately translated to the outlet, but a portion of it first must build up some water as storage on the vegetation and on the soil surface and in the pores of the soil profile, before any flow can take place. Therefore, it can be expected that, when the travel times in a basin are estimated on the basis of known velocities of overland flows and channel flows, the calculated peak outflow rates will tend to be severely overestimated. This realization led to increased efforts to include storage effects in subsequent developments. In recent years the concept of translation, underlying the time–area–concentration function, has continued to be studied and used in a more formal way. This is done by streamflow response at the catchment scale Widthfunctionw w(s+) Fig.12.12 forthechannelnetwork showninFigure11.1.Inthis case,thevariables+ topologicaldistancefromthe outletofthecatchment, scaledwiththelongest (topological)streamlength fromtheoutlet. 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 w = w(s); means of what is now usually called (see Kirkby, 1976) the width function this function can be defined as the density function of the channel flow distances in the catchment from the outlet, and it describes the (normalized) number of links, or channel segments, as a function of distance from the outlet. This distance variable hasvariouslybeentakenastheactualdistancealongthechannels,asgeometricdistance, that is the piecewise straight line joining junctions, or as the number of links, that is the in large networks the longest topological distances differ only slightly from the longest geometricaldistances.)Thenumberoflinksisstronglyrelatedwithbasinarea;moreover, average stream velocities are known (Wolman, 1955; Pilgrim, 1977; Rodriguez-Iturbe al., 1992) to remain relatively constant in the downstream direction, in spite of the decreasing slopes. Therefore, as the distances from the outlet can be taken to be roughly proportional to the travel times, the width function concept is essentially equivalent with the time–area function. However, because the width function is based on well-defined morphologicalcharacteristicsoftherivernetwork,itcanbedeterminedmoreobjectively and is therefore better suited for analysis. The correspondence between this concept and the time–area function as a unit response function was probably first pointed out by Surkan (1969), who used it to study the effect of stream channel pattern on the flow at theoutletofthebasin.Subsequently,thewidthfunctionhasprovedtobeausefultoolfor studyingthestochasticpropertiesofstreamnetworks(seeKirkby,1976;Venezianoetal., 2000) and implicitly some of their translatory response characteristics (see Gupta and Example 12.5.

The results are shown in Figure 12.12. identification of linear response functions Linear translation in series with one linear storage element The transformation of a rainfall input hyetograph into a streamflow output hydrograph involves both a delay as a result of translatory effects and a deformation and attenuation as a result of storage effects. In a linear context, the simplest way of incorporating both effects is simply to add them. Thus it stands to reason that historically the next step in the development of linear runoff routing procedures consisted of the superposition of a linear time–area function, representing pure translation, with a linear reservoir, representing pure storage. In one of the better known implementations of this idea, Clark (1945) derived the instantaneous unit hydrograph from streamflow records by numerically routing the time–area concentration function of the basin through a single concentrated storage element by means of the Muskingum method with 0. Hence, in light of Equation (7.15), this type of storage element is characterized by where is the outflow rate, and the storage, both per unit catchment area, so that storage coefficient. A similar approach was also applied successfully in the development of large-scale drainage schemes in a number of Irish catchments by O’Kelly (1955) and his fellow engineers at the Office of Public Works. However, in the early stages of this work it became clear that the routing through the concentrated storage element had such a smoothingeffectonthetime–areafunction,thattheexactshapeofthetime–areafunction was not very critical, and that there was little loss in accuracy when it was replaced by an isosceles triangle. The main parameters in the applications of this concept were the time of concentration , which is the time base needed to scale the triangular time–area function, and the storage coefficient K, or the delay, in the routing procedure by means of Equation (12.25). O’Kelly’s report is noteworthy and it suggests that in many studies the importance of the time–area function, and of the width function, may have been exaggerated. Variousprocedureshavebeenusedinthepasttoestimatethetwoparameterst and K. In Clark’s (1945) application, it was assumed that the direct effect of the rainfall ceases attheinflectionpointoftherecessionlimboftheoutflowhydrograph,andthat,fromthat time on, the outflow is merely a release from storage in the basin; accordingly he took as the time between the end of rainfall and the inflection point of the falling leg of the hydrograph, and the storage coefficient from the recession after the inflection point with 0. In the procedure described by O’Kelly (1955) the shape of the instantaneous unit hydrograph is uniquely determined by the ratio (see also Example 12.6); thus the general shape of the experimentally obtained unit hydrographs for the basin provided an estimate of this ratio, which allowed then in turn the estimation of the value of (or K) by matching the peak outflow rates. Because the shapes could not always be fitted well, often various ratios were tried yielding different and values. A review of some of the earlier methods to estimate these parameters has been presented by Dooge (1973, pp. 198–200). In several of these studies and were expressed in streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.13 Alineartranslationelementplacedinserieswithalineartankelement,asamechanisticmetaphorfor therunoffderivedbysuccessiveconvolution(orrouting)oftheinstantaneousinputδ(t)througha time–area(orwidth)functionandthroughaconcentratedstoragefunction. terms of powers of basin characteristics, such as and A. Note that both (12.21) and (12.22) suggest that should be proportional to a power of the combined variable To derive the unit response function of this model, it is necessary to consider first the unitresponseofaconcentratedstorageelement.Theflowthroughalinearstorageelement After substitution of the concentrated storage function (12.25), this can be rearranged as (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(t/K), which, upon multiplication of both sides by yields the solution exp(−t/K) constant (12.27) With a delta function input, that is x(t) the output of (12.27) is the unit response function for a single storage element; in light of (A7) this has the form exp(−t/K) u(t) (12.28) As could be expected, this is the same as the Muskingum response function (7.28) for the storm runoff is derived by successively routing the rainfall input through trans- lation and storage, can thus be formulated by simply putting (t) in sequence with becomes the input into the storage element, whose unit response is (12.28). This is illustrated in Figure 12.13. The routing is accomplished by a convolution operation, which produces immediately the unit response function of this combined system, u(t) (t (12.29) identification of linear response functions Fig.12.14 Unitresponsefunctionresultingfromatime–areafunctionwiththeshapeofanisoscelestriangle K/tc.Both routedthroughalinearstorageelementfordifferentvaluesofthetime-scaleratio u(t)andt aremadedimensionlesswithtc.Thetimescaletc isthetimeofconcentrationofthe time–areafunction(dashedline)andthetimescale isthecoefficientofthelinearstorageelement. Example 12.6 Consider a hypothetical diamond-shaped catchment with the stream channel running along one of the diagonals; in the present context this produces a triangular time–area function (or width function), which can be formulated as follows = ≤ ≤ /2 = + /2 < ≤ where is the time of concentration. Observe that the area under (t) equals unity, as it should. The unit response is calculated by applying (12.29) with (12.30). Thus, one has for −(t−τ)/Kdτ u(t) (12.31) which upon integration results in Similarly for , one can write = τe − τe + u(t) (12.33) streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.15 Sameasprevious figure,forthecaseof atime–areafunction K/t =0.1 withtheshapeofa right-angledtriangle (dashedline). which yields (cid:5) (cid:6) u(t) 1 (12.34) ItcanbereadilycheckedthatEquations(12.32)and(12.34)yieldthesamevalueforu at as they should.

The resulting instantaneous unit hydrograph, obtained by patching (12.32), (12.34) and (12.35) together over their respective time ranges, is shown in Figure 12.14. In principle, it should be possible to use this three-component unit response function with any input function x(t) in the convolution integral (12.2), to calculate the actual involved, so that in practical applications it may be more convenient to convert u(t) into tabularformandcarryoutthecalculationsnumerically.Anideaoftheeffectoftheshape of the time–area function on the resulting unit response can be gained by comparing this result with the response function obtained with a right-angled triangle shown in Figure 12.15. Combinations of linear storage elements In yet another class of models, the basin outflow is derived by routing the rainfall input solelythroughanumberofstorageelements,withoutanyformalorexplicittranslationin the formulation. Equation (12.28) is used as the response function of each of the storage elements. In what follows, a few examples are reviewed of this type of representation. identification of linear response functions Fig.12.16 AtankmodelrepresentationoftheKitakami RiverinnorthernHonshubySugawaraand Maruyama(1956).Bothtanksarelinearstorage elementswithaunitresponsefunctiongivenby Equation(12.28).Thebottompartofthefast responsetankrepresents20mmofinitialloss.

For instance, Figure 12.16 shows the arrangement used to describe flood flows of the Kitakami River in northern Honshu; the basin was represented by two elements in = = 2.9h parallel, one with 33h that receives 60% of the input, and one with that receives 35% of the input; 5% of the total input and 20 mm of the initial input into the fast response tank were assumed to be “lost.” Unlike in flood flows, in the description of daily flows, interflow and baseflow are more important; to simulate these, a differ- ent arrangement was used, which is illustrated in Figure 12.17. Initially after a drought period, precipitation flows out of the first tank into groundwater storage, from which the water flows out as baseflow. Only after the first tank has become full, does the overflow into the second tank result in subsurface stormflow runoff. Several arrangements were also proposed by Sugawara and Maruyama (1956) to accommodate spatial variation of theinputcharacteristicsofthebasin.Oneoftheseisconsideredinthefollowingexample. Example 12.7. Tank model allowing for spatial variability Figure 12.18 illustrates an arrangement by which each storage element represents a subarea of the basin. Thus each tank receives as input the output from the upstream tank, in addition to the rainfall on the subarea it represents. Let and be the fractions of the total area represented by each tank. Then, for an input into the first tank given streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.18 ExampleofatankarrangementusedbySugawara andMaruyama(1956)toaccommodatespatial variabilityoftheinputoverthecatchmentarea,to derivetheunitresponseu u(t). multiplied by . Similarly, the unit response from the second tank can be calculated by routing the output from the first tank, i.e. (t), plus the instantaneous rainfall on the second subarea, i.e. through the tank representing this second subarea, (cid:9) (cid:10) = α + α δ(τ) dτ or (12.36) (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(−t/K) In the same way, one can show that the outflow from the third tank, resulting from an instantaneous input over the entire area, which is the unit response of the catchment, is given by (cid:11) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:8) exp(−t/K) α = = + α + α In a similar approach, Nash (1957) assumed that the transformation of catchment input into streamflow output is equivalent with a succession of routings through a series of linear storage elements; thus, the input enters the first tank and is then successively routed through the second, the third, and so on (see Figure 12.19). The unit response of the Nash cascade, as it is sometimes called, can be derived as follows. The input of an instantaneous rainfall of unit volume produces an output given by Equation (12.28). identification of linear response functions Fig.12.19 Thetankcascade,proposedbyNash (1957),consistingofnequalstorage elementsplacedinseries,asametaphor fortheresponseu u(t)ofacatchment toaninstantaneousinput When this is taken as input into the second storage element, the output from that second storage is (t) (12.38) This, in turn, is input into the third storage element and produces an output (t) (12.39) The same process can be continued to obtain the outflow from the last storage element, (t/K)n−1 exp(−t/K) (t) (12.40) whichistheresponsefunctionoftheentiresystem.Inordertoallowtheuseoffractional values of n, the factorial can be replaced by the complete gamma function. Finally, the unit response of the entire catchment can be written as (t/K)n−1 exp(−t/K) u(t) (12.41) K(cid:8)(n) Equation (12.41) is known as the integrand of the incomplete gamma function or as the gamma density function. It has only two parameters, but it is quite flexible as it can accommodate a wide variety of hydrograph shapes; as illustrated in Figure 12.20, can be considered a scale parameter and a shape parameter. Equation (12.41) has been applied widely in watershed hydrology to parameterize unit hydrographs in terms of drainage basin characteristics. streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.20 Theunitresponse function,obtained withthegamma densityfunction (12.40)or(12.41)as u(t/K),for differentvaluesofthe parametern. For example, Nash (1960) used Equation (12.41) to determine the instantaneous unit hydrographs for a number of British catchments by means of the method of moments. It can readily be shown (cf. Equation (13.9)) that its first moment about the origin is and that its second moment about the mean, or center of gravity (cf. Equations (13.10) and (13.12)), is Note that with 1 and 0 these are the same as Equations (7.31) and (7.34) for the Muskingum formulation. Because the moments of u(t) can be calculated from available rainfall and streamflow records by means of the theorem of moments, as given directly with relevant basin characteristics; in this case, these were found to be drainage area, mean slope and length of the main channel. A similar study was carried out by Wu (1963) with catchments in Indiana. Actually, prior to its conceptual derivation by Nash, the incomplete gamma function had already been used by Edson (1951) on different grounds, to describe finite duration unit hydrographs. It was subsequently also used for this purpose by Gray (1961). Several features of the tank cascade may help to explain, perhaps, why the inte- grand of the incomplete gamma function has been used so widely in applied hydrology. First, consider the case where is allowed to increase indefinitely. As indicated by Equation (12.42), the center of gravity of the flood wave will then occur at a finite value of the time t, only if the storage coefficient of each tank in the cascade, K, is made to become very small. But if is made to become very small, the second moment (12.43) indicates that the duration of the flood wave will become very short. At the same time, if theareaunderthewavecurveistomaintainamagnitudeofone,themagnitudeofthepeak mustbecomeverylarge.ThisisillustratedinFigure12.21,forthecasenK 1.Thus,in → ∞, → 0, the extreme case of but finite nK, the unit response function (12.41) identification of linear response functions (12.41)(i.e.thegammadensityfunction)approachesadeltafunctionasn Fig.12.21 Theunitresponsefunction becomesverylarge.Thecurvesshownareforn= 2,5,10,20,40,80and120.Toalloweasy comparisonbetweenthedifferentcurvesasnincreases,theircentersofgravity,i.e.thefirstmoments = = 1/ninEquation(12.41). (12.42),aremaintainedatt K 1byputting should be recalled that the delta function is also the unit response function of the linear kinematic channel, as formulated in Equation (5.124). This means that a tank cascade consisting of a finite number of storage elements is in fact intermediate between two and that Equation (12.41) provides some weighted average of both effects. Put differently, a finite set of storage elements is capable of accommodating not only storage effects but also the translatory effects of the hillslopes and of the channel network in the catchment. A second feature is that, while Equation (12.41) is derived for a cascade consisting of storage elements with the same value of the storage coefficient K, this result is not very sensitive to this restriction. The following example illustrates this. Example 12.8. Cascade with unequal storage elements In the case of 2 tanks, each with a different value of the storage coefficient, namely and , instead of Equation (12.38), the unit response function becomes or, upon integration, (t) (12.44) streamflow response at the catchment scale Ku(t/K)ofacascadeofthreestorageelements(1)with Fig.12.22 Dimensionlessunitresponsefunction K,asgivenbyEquation(12.41)withn equalstoragecoefficients 3orEquation(12.39),(2)with = = 0.75K = 1.5K,and K1 K2 K3 unequalstoragecoefficients,namelyEquation (12.45)with and = 0.4,K2 = 1.0K (3)withunequalstoragecoefficients,namelyEquation (12.45)with and Inthesameway,forn 3tanks,withthreedifferentstoragecoefficients and , instead of Equation (12.39), one obtains the following expression 1 1 3 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 3 This process can be continued for any number of tanks. For 3 as an example, Figure 12.22 shows a comparison between Equations (12.39) and (12.45) with and also with K, the main K K K K K 2 3 1 2 3 point is that the difference between these response functions is not very large, because the total lag time, that is the first moment has been kept the same in all three cases, such that 3K (cf. Equation (12.42)). The agreement would have been even better, if also the second moment had been kept the same in all three cases. This calculation illustrates why the passage of rain water through a succession of storage elements, such as interception and detention, soil moisture and groundwater, overland and channel flows, may still be described reasonably well by Equation (12.41), even though each one of these storage elements may have a different storage coefficient K. Stochastic interpretations Several of the above response functions, as combinations of storage tanks with or with- out linear channels, have been used with good results in the solution of a number of engineering problems. In some of these studies of specific catchment situations, ad hoc empirical relationships were derived for the parameters in these runoff representations. stationary nonlinear lumped response However, because no direct link could be established between the parameters and the physical mechanisms in the catchment, like any other unit hydrograph they suffer from a lackofgeneralityandtheymustalwaysbecalibratedtobeofanyuse.Forthisreasonthe quest has continued for better formulations of the catchment scale processes involved in the transformation of precipitation into runoff. One of the more active lines of endeavor has made use of stochastic concepts to describe the instantaneous unit hydrograph as the distribution of the arrival times of water at the catchment outlet. These approaches have typically consisted of linear rout- ing of precipitation through topologically random channel networks with various prob- ability distributions for the channel segments and with different assumptions regarding the holding time or travel time distributions of the water in the channel segments. As different concepts have matured, the width function has gradually emerged as the tool of choice to describe the structure of the channel network (Snell and Sivapalan, 1994; Marani al., 1994; Veneziano al., 2000), and has replaced earlier methods based on Horton–Strahler stream ordering (see Figure 11.1) and the resulting order ratios. Simi- larly, different attempts have been made to improve the formulation of the holding times from exponential distributions (Rodriguez-Iturbe and Valdes, 1979; Gupta al., 1980) to more realistic response functions, such as obtained from the complete linear solution The inclusion of hillslope outflows into the channel network has also been explored (see VanderTak and Bras, 1990; Robinson al., 1995) with different hillslope response functions. Note that the assumption of an exponential distribution of residence times in a channel segment is equivalent with the assumption of a linear storage element as formulated by Equation (12.28). An overview of advances in this stochastic approach has been presented by Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo (1997). With the growing complexity of such representations and the increasing number of the required parameters, these approaches are gradually evolving into direct simulation models; however, in the process the appeal of parsimony of the unit hydrograph is being lost,whileitsmainlimitations,namelylinearityandtimeinvariancearebeingkept.Also, although the description of the channel network is becoming increasingly realistic, the simulation of some critical processes at the catchment scale, involving the inclusion of hillslope mechanisms, with such thorny aspects as preferential flow and simultaneous transport of new and old water (see Chapter 11), has not received much attention so far; its inclusion in linear theory remains an elusive goal and will require more research.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of linear runoff routing, what is the main advantage of using methods that derive unit hydrographs for ungaged watersheds from maps and physical attributes?", "answer": "The main advantage is that the resulting response functions usually require only a few parameters, making them more general and easier to calibrate."}, {"question": "How do the Rational Method and the time-area method differ in their approach to calculating peak discharge rates?", "answer": "The Rational Method provides only the peak discharge rate, whereas the time-area method allows for a more complete description of the entire hydrograph, including its rise and recession, by accounting for the effects of drainage area shape and time variation of storm rainfall."}, {"question": "Why is the width function considered a more objective and better-suited tool for analysis compared to the time-area function?", "answer": "The width function is based on well-defined morphological characteristics of the river network, making it more objective and better suited for analysis.

The Volterra series enables the modeling of these nonlinear effects, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of hydrological system behavior and improved predictive capabilities."}, {"question": "How do the numerical complexities of computations increase with the use of nonlinear formulations like the Volterra series in hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The numerical complexities of computations increase with the use of nonlinear formulations like the Volterra series because these models require the estimation of multiple response functions and the solution of complex equations. This can lead to higher computational demands, including increased processing time and memory requirements. Additionally, the calibration of nonlinear models can be more challenging due to the larger number of parameters, which can introduce additional complexities and uncertainties in the modeling process"}]}
{"paragraph": "12.3.2 Nonlinear runoff routing This method of transforming rainfall into basin streamflow has mostly made use of concentrated storage elements, and is therefore also referred to as storage routing. In most cases the nonlinear storage function was assumed to be of the power type, m((cid:7)= where and 1) are adjustable parameters; in this form the storage function can be considered a generalization of Equation (12.25). After substitution of (12.48) in the In what follows a few examples are presented of past attempts to include this type of nonlinearity in the catchment response behavior. Horton (1941) was the first to use this approach; he proposed that flood hydrographs can be considered the result of a triangular “virtual channel inflow graph” produced by rainfall on the adjoining land, which is then routed through nonlinear channel storage by means of Equation (12.49). Horton (1936; 1937) estimated the parameters of the storage function (12.48) from quasi-steady open channel flow considerations. From analysis of a large number of flood events on different rivers, he showed that during a recession the channel storage behaves nearly the same as if the entire volume were concentrated in a single reservoir; but during rising stages it behaves as a reservoir of somewhat streamflow response at the catchment scale larger capacity. He reasoned by means of the GM equation (5.41) that should lie around for channels with a rectangular section, and around for channels with a triangular section; although there was some scatter, an analysis of river recession flow data (cf. Equation (12.54)) confirmed that was mostly between 0.6 and 0.8. Interestingly, although it was nonlinear, Horton’s approach provided the impetus for Section 12.2.2. Asecondtypeofnonlinearrunoffmodel,whichhasbeenusedinanumberofstudies, consists of arrays of nonlinear storage elements, like Equation (12.48), in series and in parallel representing different components of the basin; the storage arrays are usually structured in the same arrangement as the actual stream channel network. Such arrays can be considered nonlinear analogs of the linear ones, examples of which are shown in Figures 12.16–12.19. One such routing procedure was described by Rockwood (1958), who used it to forecast streamflow in the entire Columbia River Basin on the basis of preceding streamflows and forecasts of basin inputs from snowmelt and rainfall. This large basin was assumed to consist of a number of subbasins, lakes and stream channels. Each subbasin was assumed to consist of two nonlinear storage elements in seriesrepresentingsurfacerunoff,whichareplacedinparallelwithtwostorageelements in series representing subsurface runoff. Channel segments, mostly between 30 and 80 km long, were represented by three nonlinear storage elements in series. The routing procedure consisted essentially of the numerical solution of Equation (12.49) for each storage element, in which it was assumed that and was derived by trial routings. Different arrays of nonlinear storage elements, each representing a subarea and each receiving the excess rainfall input on that subarea plus the outflow from the upstream storage elements, were devised by Laurenson (1964) and subsequently by Mein al. (1974) to simulate storm flows from catchments in Australia. In this approach the catch- ment area is first subdivided in a number of approximately equal subareas along the major tributaries, and a nonlinear tank is then located at the center of gravity of each of the subareas and assigned a relative lag time of that location. At first this relative lag – or storage delay – time was assumed to be proportional to ), where and are the length and slope of the reach through the subarea, and the summation was carried out from the location of the subarea to the outlet; however, it was subsequently found that putting it proportional to the distance from the outlet, i.e. L, yielded the same results; this shows that the effects of slope, flow depth and surface roughness become irrelevant in this type of idealization. The parameter was estimated by observing from comparison of (12.25) with (12.48) that Then in accordance with Equation (7.19), logarithmic regression was carried out for a number of storms between the time from the centroid of the excess rain to that of (cid:8)y(cid:9); the storm runoff and the average storm runoff during the event, the slopes of the Askew,1970)arangeofroughly0.60 ≤ ≤ 0.81.Thesevaluesareverysimilartothose stationary nonlinear lumped response could be used as a typical value. As indicated in Equation (12.50), is proportional to the time of travel; accordingly, this parameter was estimated by putting in which was taken to be the value of the relative travel time through the subarea represented by that particular storage tank, i.e. ) or mentioned earlier. With and known, remained as the only unknown parameter of the model; this was estimated by trial-and-error routings with available data. A more optimal estimation of theparametersinthismodelwassubsequentlydevelopedbyKuczera(1990)andKuczera and Williams (1992). A similar nonlinear storage routing procedure was developed by (or lag) was made to depend also on the area represented by the storage element, aAbym−1; = = 0.57 namely as in their case the constants were taken as and the slightly different value Physical justification of nonlinear tanks In the past, the nonlinear storage relationship (12.48) has been justified on physical grounds,mostlybyconsideringopenchannelstorage.Theargumentusuallyfollowsthat originally developed by Horton (1936; 1937), based on a lumped kinematic analysis for quasi-steady, quasi-uniform flow. Thus the volume of water stored in a channel reach of length is assumed to be given by L, in which is the average cross-sectional area in the reach. The channel is assumed to be wide enough, so that the hydraulic radius equals the mean water depth, or h, and the cross-sectional area of the channel equals the depth times the width, or . For steady uniform conditions, (5.39) (or (5.43)) produces then the outflow rate from the reach as the channel storage is in terms of the outflow from the reach (cid:7) (cid:8) Q1/(a+1) in which and are the parameters in the open channel equation (5.39). Hence, if it is assumed that all the storm runoff water in the catchment is stored in the stream channels, so that one has (cid:7) (cid:8) y1/(a+1) inwhich,asbefore, isnowthelengthofallstreamchannelsinthecatchment upstream from the point where is determined, and in which the other variables are assumed to be averages over the catchment area A. This result is in the form of (12.48), = + = 0.60 = 0.67 with (a for the GM equation, and for the Ch´ ezy equation. But this derivation of Equation (12.53) is not wholly convincing, first, because obvi- ously not all the storm runoff water is stored in channels, and second, because it is well known that a major part of most storm flows is generated by subsurface runoff, as explained in Chapter 11. Some estimate of groundwater storage can be obtained streamflow response at the catchment scale by considering unconfined flow under the hydraulic assumption.

{"paragraph": "12.4 NON-STATIONARY LINEAR RESPONSE In the definition of the unit hydrograph the two stipulated assumptions are linearity and time invariance. Until now, these two assumptions have mainly been studied separately, andtheircombinedeffecthasnotyetbeenfullyexplored.Theincorporationofnonlinear effects into stationary systems, which is treated in Section 12.3, seems to have received more attention in the literature and relatively few studies have been devoted to nonsta- tionary effects on linear catchment response. Yet, several experimental investigations reviewed in Chapter 11 have indicated that, for instance, the ratio of old and new water in the catchment outflow is affected not only by the intensity of the rain, but also by such factors as seasonal moisture status and the time since the start of the rain. Hence, as the catchment contains more or less water, different flow paths and mechanisms come into play in the production of the runoff, and this results in a non-stationary response. In general, one can distinguish two ways of describing non-stationarity. One type of formulation makes use of a coarse time variable describing changes in catchment responseatmonthlyandannualtimescales;thesechangescouldconceivablybecyclical, that is seasonal, or in the nature of a trend in the case of changes in land use or climate. non-stationary linear response The second type of approach uses a finer time variable to describe response changes during the event itself, as a result of physical changes inside the catchment resulting from continued rain, snowmelt or flooding. These two types can be combined formally in a convolution integral, as an extension of Equation (12.2), namely y(t) (12.57) u(χ,τ,t − τ) stationary case of Equation (12.2), here the unit response is a function of three time variables; the first variable is the coarse time scale in terms of months, seasonsoryears.Thesecond,τ,isthedummyvariableofintegration,suchthat0 ≤ τ ≤ however, as argument in the unit response, it denotes the time of the input and thus specifies the response for the input at that time. The third, t, is the time for which − τ) x(τ). the output is to be determined and (t is the time elapsed since the input The convolution operation of Equation (12.57) describes superposition, which is the essence of linearity. However, as pointed out by Diskin and Boneh (1974), in contrast to the stationary case, here the convolution (or superposition) operation is generally not commutable. This means, for example, that two non-stationary systems connected in series, say A followed by B, will produce a different output when their order is reversed, B followed by A. Forthefirsttypeofnon-stationaritytheunitresponseinEquation(12.57)dependsonly year.Thismeansthatduringtheinputeventtheresponsecanbeconsideredstationary,and the concepts discussed in Sections 12.1 and 12.2 are applicable. Therefore, the second type is the one usually considered, when time variance effects are to be included. In this case, the unit response depends only on and (t and (12.57) can be simplified to y(t) (12.58) This is illustrated in Figure 12.24. In discrete form (cf. Equation (12.9)) this can be written as or alternatively (cf. Equation (12.10)), as i−k+1 i−k+1,k where the first subscript of the response function refers to the time of the input, and the second indicates its role in the numerical convolution. In several applications of the nonstationary linear approach in the past, the form of the unit response function has been assumed a priori. For example, Snyder (1970) derived the catchment response by routing, what was essentially a time–area diagram through a linear storage element with time-dependent storage coefficient streamflow response at the catchment scale Fig.12.24 Illustrationoftheconvolution (cid:13) = x(τ)u(τ,t operation withanonstationaryunitresponse = u(τ,t).(Thevaluesof u y anduare notdrawntoscale.)Thevariablet denotesthetimeforwhichtherunoff iscalculatedandτ isthetimesincethe startoftheprecipitationinput unitresponse,whichisshownatonly threeinstantsoftimeτ,continually changesitsshapeastheprecipitation continues.Comparethiswiththe stationarycaseofFigure12.6. ered different combinations of time-variant linear channel and time-variant linear stor- age elements, one among them being a cascade of equal storage elements. Diskin and Boneh (1974) developed numerical least squares procedures to derive more general, i.e. not with a preconceived mathematical form, response functions , as shown in probablytheonlyonethatconsideredbothfine-scaleandcoarse-scalenon-stationarityas formulated in Equation (12.57). The unit response function was obtained by routing the input through a single linear storage element, as given by (12.25) with a time-dependent storage coefficient in the form of a power function in which and were assumed to be functions of the coarse time variable Rainfall– runoffdataobtainedinPennsylvaniaindicatedthata wasafunctionofb andthatb could bedescribedwellbyasinefunctionofχ.Equation(12.61)indicatesthatinthisstudythe storage coefficient was observed to decrease as the precipitation continued; because means that the unit response tended to become faster with storm duration. The approach was later extended by Chiu and Huang (1970) to include nonlinear effects by replacing (12.25) by its nonlinear analog (12.48). references REFERENCES Amorocho, J. and Brandstetter, A.

It is a function of three time variables: the coarse time scale (in terms of months, seasons, or years), the dummy variable of integration (which denotes the time of the input), and the time for which the output is to be determined.

For example, two non-stationary systems connected in series will produce a different output when their order is reversed. This non-commutativity has significant implications for the analysis of hydrological systems, as it means that the sequence of processes and the timing of inputs can greatly influence the system's response.

The relative frequency gives a \"feel\" for the meaning of probability in everyday life but is limited by the finite nature of real-world experiments.

{"paragraph": "13.2.4 Empirical probability plots It is often useful to plot the data from a hydrologic measurement record to gain a general idea of their statistical characteristics. The (empirical) probability plot, also known as the frequency plot or frequency curve, and sometimes as the quantile plot, is a common tool for this purpose. This plot is a graphical representation of the probability (of non- exceedance or exceedance) of the individual data in the record against their respective magnitudes, i.e. F(x). For a data record, consisting of items, normally measured at regular intervals, the procedure is as follows. (i) Tabulate the data, , ranked in increasing magnitude, so that ; (ii) assign an order number to each item, in 1,2,...,m ,...,n accordance with its respective subscript, namely ; (iii) estimate the (empirical) probabilityP , that the magnitude of the item will not be exceeded, for each itembymeansofasuitableplottingpositionformula.Thisplottingposition isusedas an estimate of the value of the unknown probability F(x ) for the observed event . In the past numerous plotting position formulae have been suggested. Cunnane (1978) has presented a critical review of the history and properties of some of the more common ones. Plotting position Probably the oldest and intuitively the simplest is The problem with this expression is that the largest item on record is assigned a probability of one, that is certainty;inotherwords,withthisformulaitisassumedthatthemagnitudeofthelargest will never be exceeded in the future. Because this is impossible, the use of this plotting position is tantamount to discarding the largest item in the record.

This is unacceptable, according to Gumbel (1958), because the estimated return period of the largest event should approach the length of the period of record, as becomes large. These difficulties are not encountered in the Weibull formula that beside the avoidance of difficulties for 0 or 1, so that all data can be plotted, it also has the following advantages: (i) it is independent of the distribution function F(x); (ii)thereturnperiodofthelargest(orsmallest,asthecasemaybe)observationapproaches the number of observations n; (iii) all observations are equally spaced on the frequency scale, which means that the difference between the plotting positions of the mth and the (m 1)th observation is a function only of n; (iv) it is intuitively simple and can be readily implemented.Its mainadvantage, however, is that itcan be theoreticallyjustified as the mean of the probability of the mth smallest observation; this can be proved as follows. Derivation of Weibull plotting position Consider again a sample of observations, after they have been ranked in increasing magnitude, so that . The probability distribution of the mth smallest observation by itself is given by Equation (13.3), or and the density of this observation by itself is (X ) (13.21) However, doesnotoccurbyitself,butinconjunctionwith(n 1)otherobservations; and (m 1) do not. The probability of this occurrence is given by the binomial distribution (see Section 13.3.2 below), and equals Fm−1 )n−m in which the symbol F(X ) is introduced for conciseness of notation, and “success” refers to non-exceedance. The probabilities of each observation are inde- pendent. Moreover, the mth smallest observation, , can occupy different places in the sequence of the remaining (n 1) observations, namely in front of all of them and elements of frequency analysis in hydrology behind each one of them. Hence the density function of the mth smallest observation ,occurringinconjunctionwiththeoccurrenceoftheremaining(n 1)observations, is equal to times the probability given by (13.22), multiplied by the density of by itself (Equation (13.21)), or Fm−1 )n−m if has a density function (y), then the density function of is given by (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) Applyingthistothepresentcasebyputting and ,oneobtainsthedensity function of (X ) from (13.23), namely Fm−1 )n−m g(F ) (1 (13.25) The mean of is the first moment, or, since 0 1, inwhich isadummyvariableofintegration.Theintegralinthisexpressionisacomplete betafunction,whichcanbeexpressedintermsoffactorials(e.g.AbramowitzandStegun, proves that the assumed plotting position of Equation (13.19) is in fact the mean of the probability of non-exceedance of the mth observation, that is .

To facilitate interpretation of the plotted dataandinterpolation,itisdesirabletoeliminateorreducethiscurvaturebystretchingor shrinking the scale in the appropriate range of values of , so that the points plot more nearly along a straight line. A common way to accomplish this is the use of probability paper. Hazen (1914b) appears to have been the first to advocate the use of probability paper in hydrology. Probability graph paper, for any given probability function F(x), is designed in such a way that, when that function or the corresponding return period (x) is plotted against x, one obtains a straight line. The most common types of probability paper involve a probability function with two parameters, say and b, whose values depend on the data summary descriptors of a probability distribution function under consideration; thus to make the probability paper generally applicable to any data set it is necessary to eliminate the dependency on these parameters. This can be done with a linear transformation of the type a(x b) (13.27) in which the nature of and depends on the particular function F(x) that is being used. For instance, in the case of the normal distribution one has and the case of the first asymptote for largest values, as will be seen below, is the mode, that is the value of where the density (x) is a maximum, and This transformation results in a distribution function, say (y), given by = + y/a) (y) F(b (13.28) whichisindependentoftheparameters.Inprinciple,probabilitypaperisconstructedasa plotof versus y,withthevaluesofa and leftunspecified;when F(x)issymmetrical, 0 is placed at the center of the scale.

However, most types of probability paper do not show the y-scale, and only is based on the normal probability distribution, has been made available commercially in the past, nowadays normal scales can be generated by standard computer programs. For some applications, the x-variable is transformed logarithmically, so that it is log(x) which is plotted against (y) or (y).

By stretching or shrinking the scale in the appropriate range of values, probability paper allows the data to plot more nearly along a straight line, which facilitates interpolation and the identification of patterns or trends.

The use of probability paper can also help to reveal underlying structures or patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data."}, {"question": "In the context of probability paper, what is the purpose of the linear transformation of the type a(x - b), and how does it relate to the distribution function F(x)?", "answer": "The purpose of the linear transformation of the type a(x - b) is to eliminate the dependency of the probability paper on the parameters of the distribution function F(x). By applying this transformation, the resulting distribution function, say G(y), becomes independent of the parameters a and b, which depend on the specific data set being analyzed. This allows the probability paper to be generally applicable to any data set, without the need for customization. The transformation is designed such that, when the function F(x) or the corresponding return period is plotted against x, one obtains a straight line, which facilitates the interpretation and analysis of the data."}, {"question": "How does the Weibull plotting position formula derive the mean of the probability of non-exceedance of the mth observation, and what are the implications of this derivation?", "answer": "The Weibull plotting position formula derives the mean of the probability of non-exceedance of the mth observation by considering the probability distribution of the mth smallest observation and the density function of this observation. The formula takes into account the fact that the mth smallest observation can occupy different places in the sequence of the remaining (n - 1) observations, and that the probabilities of each observation are independent. The derivation of the Weibull formula proves that the assumed plotting position is in fact the mean of the probability of non-exceedance of the mth observation, which has important implications for the analysis and interpretation of hydrologic data. This derivation provides a theoretical justification for the use of the Weibull formula and highlights its advantages over other plotting position formulas."}, {"question": "Why is the use of the oldest and simplest plotting position formula tantamount to discarding the largest item in the record, and what are the implications of this limitation?", "answer": "The use of the oldest and simplest plotting position formula is tantamount to discarding the largest item in the record because it assigns a probability of one to the largest item, implying that its magnitude will never be exceeded in the future. This is an unrealistic assumption, as it is impossible to predict with certainty that the largest item will never be exceeded. The implications of this limitation are significant, as it can lead to biased or inaccurate estimates of the probability of non-exceedance and return periods. This limitation highlights the need for more nuanced and accurate plotting position formulas, such as the Weibull formula, which can provide a more realistic and reliable estimate of the probability of non-exceedance."}]}

This is simply the sum of the probabilities, or if denotes the number of trials needed to experience failure, as a random variable, P{K ≤ k} = − p) (13.30) which yields immediately 1 It can also be seen that Equation (13.30) yields unity, that is certainty, when Actually, (13.30) could also have been obtained by considering first the probability that failure would not occur for trials; since the trials are independent, this is equal to Its complement is the probability that it will take or fewer trials for failure to occur. Example 13.2.

Example 13.3. Probability of sequences of dry or rainy days The geometric distribution has been used by Hershfield (1970a, b; 1971) to study the probability of periods of a given length with or without precipitation. In this type of application pdenotestheconditionalprobabilityofasuccessbeingfollowedbyasuccess. elements of frequency analysis in hydrology Fig.13.4 Theprobability that anannualmaximum flowwithaknown probability = = 0.98,will beexceededafter exactlyk years.Thisis a50yeventandthe probabilitythatitwill beexceededafter50y is0.00743.(See Example13.2.) 0 20 40 60 801 Fig.13.5 Theprobability thatanannual maximumflowwith aknownprobability = = 0.98, willbeexceeded years.Thisisa50y eventandthe probabilitythatit willbeexceeded before50yhave passedis0.636.(See Equation(13.30)and 0 20 40 60 100 Example13.2.) In general, a success can refer to a day without rain, a day with rain, or some other desirable event, whatever the case may be. For the sake of illustration, let denote the probability that a day without rain be followed by a day without rain. In this case, the form of Equation (13.29) arises again as the simple product of the probabilities of a dry day being succeeded by a dry day for a sequence of days, multiplied by the probability of a dry kth day being succeeded by a rainy (k 1)th day; in other words, (13.29) represents the probability of experiencing a sequence of exactly dry This product in (13.29) involves the assumption that the events are independent, or which is the same, that remains constant and does not change with k, the duration of the period of dry days. Whether or not this is the case can be examined on the basis of the following considerations.

The slopes of the regression lines through the origin are 0.708, 0.815 and 0.868, respectively, which should be reasonable estimates of for each of these three thresholds. The more common way, however, to estimate the parameters is the method of moments. Because the geometric distribution (13.29) has only one parameter, viz. p, a knowledge of the mean of will suffice.

This ratio should be constant for all k if the assumption holds, and it represents the conditional probability of a dry day being followed by another dry day, denoted as p. By checking this ratio, hydrologists can determine whether the geometric distribution is a suitable model for the dry day sequences, and whether the estimated value of p is reasonable."}, {"question": "How does the method of moments estimate the parameter p in the geometric distribution, and what is the advantage of this method in hydrological applications?", "answer": "The method of moments estimates the parameter p in the geometric distribution by using the mean duration of a dry period, which is given by the total number of dry days divided by the number of dry periods. This method is advantageous in hydrological applications because it provides a straightforward and efficient way to estimate p, which is essential for modeling sequences of dry or rainy days.

The example provided, where the probability of a frost-free year is estimated to be 26/45, demonstrates how this estimation is used in the binomial distribution formula to calculate the probability of experiencing a certain number of frost-free years, such as 3, 4, or 5 years, within a specified period."}, {"question": "In what ways can the binomial distribution be used to analyze and understand hydrological phenomena beyond the prediction of frost-free years, such as precipitation patterns or drought events?", "answer": "The binomial distribution can be applied to various hydrological phenomena by treating each event (e.g., a day with precipitation, a month with below-average rainfall) as a success or failure. This allows for the analysis of the probability of sequences of events, such as the number of consecutive days with precipitation or the number of months in a row with drought conditions.

For convenient reference a few values are presented in Table 13.1. As will be seen below, the values listed in Table 13.2 for zero skew (i.e. for 0) are the quantiles of (x of the normal distribution for the indicated probabilities. The use of this distribution can be justified by means of the Central Limit Theorem; thisstatesthat,ifarandomvariableisthesumofn random,notnecessarilyindependent, variables, each with its own, not necessarily normal, density function with a finite mean and variance, then the density of this random variable tends to the normal function (13.34) as increases. In hydrology the normal distribution is commonly assumed to be applicable in the description of various types of central tendency observations, such as mean annual temperatures, annual river discharge rates, among others.

This theorem states that the sum of random variables, each with its own density function and finite mean and variance, tends towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases.

This deviation suggests that while the normal distribution may adequately model average conditions, it may not fully capture the behavior of extreme hydrological events, such as those caused by tropical storms.

These events, characterized by high precipitation over short periods, can lead to severe floods, as seen in the case of Tropical Storm Agnes, which caused the most severe flood in the Susquehanna basin.

It is now still widely used in the United States for this purpose. Further details and recommendations by this interagency group for the practical application of this distribution can be found in Bulletin 17B (Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data, 1982). Beside the standard application of the method, Bulletin 17B also contains suggestions on plotting historical data (i.e. dating from prior to the period of record), and regionalization with data from hydrologically similar watersheds. A more comprehensive treatment of this distribution was presented by Bob´ ee and Ashkar As noted earlier, the skew coefficient tends to exhibit greater variability between samples than the mean and the variance. This may be overcome by regionalization (see Section 13.5.2 below). Several techniques have been used in the past to obtain a regional value, in place of the locally calculated value, if the data record is short. These include the construction of a map with iso-lines obtained by interpolation of the values computedattheexistinggagingstationsintheregion;anotherpossibilityisthederivation of a regression relationship between the available skew values in the region and basin characteristics; finally, as a third possible approach, the skew may simply be taken as the average of all available skew values from the records in the region with long records; the average can also be weighted by multiplying each available value by the number of years of record at that gaging station divided by the average number of years of record of all stations in the region. Hardison (1974) has presented regional values of the skew coefficient for the annual peak flow rates in rivers in the United States, but with the availability of additional data since then, these results have gradually become obsolete. Tasker and Stedinger (1986) have further improved the estimation procedure of regional skew values. Example 13.7.

{"paragraph": "13.4.5 The first asymptotic distribution of extreme values Extreme values and their initial distribution When several samples consisting of, say, items are taken from the same population, the mth smallest item in each sample is a random variable, which follows a certain distribution function. The form of this distribution function of the mth quantile depends elements of frequency analysis in hydrology on and n, and on the distribution function of the population from which the samples are drawn. When the distribution function of the population as a whole is mentioned in reference to the distribution function of the quantiles, it is often called the distribution. The extreme values of the samples are their smallest and their largest items. Obviously,thedistributionfunctionsoftheseextremevaluesofthesamplesdependonly on n, the number of items in the samples, and on the initial distribution. When the size of the samples is very large, i.e. in the limit when the distribution functions of the extreme values are called or asymptotes. Clearly, asymptotic distribution functions an extreme value asymptote no longer depends on and n, but only on the nature of its initial distribution. Inthestudyofextremevaluesthreegeneraltypesofinitialdistribution F(x)havebeen considered (Gumbel, 1954a; 1958). Each of these types results in a different functional form of the extreme value asymptotes. The first type, which is called the exponential type, comprises those distributions that for large converge to unity at least as fast as the exponential function itself; all their moments exist. These types of distribution satisfy and (13.45) for very large and for very small values of x, respectively. Since both numerator and denominatorintheseratiosareverysmall,thissuggeststheapplicationofdeL’Hospital’s rule; hence one can continue the process, to obtain for very large x, (cid:6)(x) 1 F(x) (x) and so on, and an analogous result for very small x. Examples of this type of distri- bution are the normal, the logistic, the gamma, and their logarithmically transformed distributions. The distributions of the second type are also referred to as distributions; Cauchy type these are distributions, which do not have moments above a certain order. The belong to the third type of initial distributions; these are distributions ited distributions with an upper or lower bound or with both. In hydrology they are mainly of interest in the analysis of low flows and droughts. This brings up the point that the classification into these three separate types of initial distributions is not always rigid. For exam- ple, the lognormal distribution is of the exponential type at the upper end, since can assume values all the way to infinity; however, it is of the limited type at the lower end of the distribution, because cannot be smaller than zero or c, as can be seen in Equations (13.38) and (13.39). The first asymptote for largest values This distribution is also often referred to as the Gumbel distribution after the statistician who clarified and promoted its use (Gumbel, 1954a; 1958). Several derivations have been presented in the literature. One of the simpler derivations proceeds as follows. The starting point is the Taylor expansion of the initial distribution about some characteristic some probability distributions for continuous variables large value of x, denoted by , or n n n n n From the definition of exponential type distributions (13.45) for large values it follows 1 F(u ) [1 F(u The value of is fairly arbitrary, but if it is defined such that its probability is given = − 1/n, by F(u ) 1 the derivation becomes especially straightforward. (Note that this is almost, but not quite, the average probability of the largest event in the sample, − 1/(n + some algebra, (13.47) can be written as (cid:13) (cid:14) α2 − α3 − α = )/[1 − parameter; thus, with the definition of , this series becomes = − exp[−α − Recall that F(x) is the initial distribution of the population from which the items of the sample were taken, and that it indicates the probability that any item of the sample is smaller than or equal to x. The probability that all items are smaller than or equal to G(x) (13.50) provided the items are independent of one another. Combination of Equations (13.49) and (13.50) produces (cid:5) (cid:6) exp[−α − In the limit, as the size of the sample is allowed to increase indefinitely, so that one obtains (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964, 4.2.21) the asymptotic distribution function of the largest values G(x) (13.52) (cid:6)(x), and the corresponding density function g(x) or g(x) (13.53) where (x )isthereducedlargestvalue.Thedistributionandthedensityfunc- tion of the extremes are denoted in this section by G(x) and g(x), merely to distinguish them from the initial distribution function and the initial density function, respectively. elements of frequency analysis in hydrology Probability paper based on (13.52), often referred to as Gumbel paper, is illustrated in Figure 13.3. In the derivation of Equation (13.52) its two parameters and were related to the properties of the initial distribution F(x). In practice, however, the parameters are determineddirectlyfromtheobservedlargestvalues.Bymeansofthemomentgenerating functions (Gumbel, 1958) the first two moments of (13.52) can be shown to be and 6) (13.54) γ = 0.57722 α where is known as Euler’s number. Thus the parameters and can be determined immediately from the first two moments of the largest values, as calculated with (13.13). Observe that, since the mean of the reduced variable is given by on account of the first of (13.54), it follows that so that 2.328; in other words, the first asymptote (13.52) predicts that the return period of the mean is 2.33 time units (e.g. years in the case X, the random variable in question, represents the annual flood). Note also that by putting 0 with + 0.36651/α with (13.52) one finds that the median is given by (u ). The first asymptote has been widely applied in the description of maxima. In hydrol- ogy, it has been especially useful in the analysis of annual floods, i.e. the yearly maximal discharges on record. It is useful to restate the assumptions on which the derivation is based, to gain a better understanding of its applicability. These are (i) the initial dis- tribution is of the exponential type; (ii) the events, from among which the largest are considered, must be independent; (iii) the sample size is infinitely large. In the case of the yearly floods, i.e. the maxima of the daily flows, these conditions are not really met. There is no doubt a strong correlation between successive daily flows; thus the truly independent events in one year are likely to last much longer than a single day; this greatly reduces their number from 365 to a value, which is probably not large enough to allow the use of an asymptote; this fact also obscures the nature of the initial distribution, which may not be exponential. Oneofitspracticaldisadvantagesisthat,sinceithasonlytwoparameters,allmoments above the second are related to the first two; this means, for example, that it has a third = 2.40411/α3 moment about the mean , and therefore a constant skew coefficient, = /σ3 = 1.1395. namely Only rarely does the estimated skew coefficient of a record of annual floods have this value. Of course, other two-parameter distributions, such as the lognormal or gamma distributions, suffer the same drawback. Another point of interest is the behavior of the first asymptote for extremely large events. Inversion of (13.52) with (13.15) yields the reduced variable as a function of the return period Since ln(1 z) (provided 1 and (Abramowitz and some probability distributions for continuous variables written as ln(T ) (13.56) or, to a good approximation, lnT (13.57) This shows that, if the largest events are plotted against on semi-log graph paper, they should tend to a straight line in the range of very large values of . This may be a useful procedure to apply, when no probability paper is available. It is remarkable also that Equation (13.57) is in the same form of, and thus provides a theoretical justification for, the equation proposed by Fuller (1914) to describe annual floods. Indeed, Fuller found empirically, “. . . by plottings of the existing data on American rivers” available to him, that the largest 24 h average rate of flow to be expected in years is = + 0.8logT (1 ) (13.58) in which is the average annual flood and log denotes the decimal logarithm; Fuller (1914) also observed that is proportional to where is the drainage The first asymptote for smallest values Whenever the initial distribution F(x) is symmetrical about the origin, in accordance with Equation (13.11), the probability that an observation is larger than is given by hence the probability that the smallest in a sample of independent observations is larger than is making use of this symmetry, one obtains G(x) (13.60) whereasbeforey (x ).Thusthefirstasymptoteforsmallestvaluescanbeobtained from that for the largest values by replacing and by and , respectively. Most initial distributions are not symmetrical; but Gumbel (1958) has indicated how in the case of asymmetrical distributions the symmetry principle can be extended simply by adopting new parameters, say and , instead of and .

Thus, as was the case with the first asymptote for the largest values, the parameters can only be determined from the available smallest values.

The generalized extreme value distribution in the form of (13.74) was introduced in the environmental sciences by Jenkinson (1955), and it has subsequently found wide application in the prediction of various extreme phenomena, such as floods, rain events, wind speeds and wave heights; it has also come to be used in the estimation of regional Madsen al., 1997; Martins and Stedinger, 2000). Its full potential continues to be explored (Katz al., 2002). Example 13.8. Extreme value distributions applied to annual peak flows In this example a stream in a more arid climate is considered.

{"paragraph": "13.4.8 Power law (or fractal) distribution Many natural phenomena exhibit a type of self-similarity or scale invariance in their magnitudes, such that, for instance, the ratio of the event with return period 100 and that with 10, is equal to the ratio of those with 1000 and 100.

The corresponding density function is (x) (13.86) In the practical application of this function, the parameters and can be derived simply by least squares linear regression of the logs of the observed values against the logs of their return periods , in accordance with Equation (13.84). The power distribution has been found useful in the description of numerous phe- nomena, such as fragmentation, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mineral deposits, and land forms, among others. In hydrology, the power distribution probably found its ear- liest application in the description of rainfall intensities. Equation (3.3), whose origins Figure 3.16.) A noteworthy feature in this particular application of Equation (13.84) is that its coefficient is also a power function of the duration of the rainfall event, for values of in excess of 2 h. In a different context, namely in the description of substitution of (8.5), suggests a power distribution and fractal features of the smaller pores; this is illustrated for a sand in the example of Figure 8.20, indicating a straight line for large values of the capillary suction H. More recently, the power distribution has also been used to describe flow maxima. Turcotte (1994) and Malamud al. (1996) have presented cases where it provided a better fit with flood data than the generalized log-gamma distribution. However, the distribution appears to be more applicable to partial duration flow data than to annual flow maxima. Partial duration flow series contain all the data above a given pre-defined base, whereas annual flow series contain only the peak discharge rates observed during each year of the record. The main disadvantage of an annual series is that in some years a number of events may be larger than the annual event in other years. In the analysis of very large events this is rarely a problem, because the two types of data series tend to be nearlythesameforeventswithreturnperiodsinexcessofaboutthreetimeunits,yearsin thiscase.Hence,intheestimationoftheparametersa and inthepowerdistributionfor annual peak flows, it is advisable to use only the data whose return period is larger than 3 y, or whose probability of non-exceedance is larger than 0.67. This is illustrated below in Example 13.9. The performance of the power distribution, to describe annual peak flowsincomparisonwithotherdistributions,isalsoillustratedFigures13.9,13.10,13.12 and 13.14. It can be seen that it tends to produce smaller values of the non-exceedance probability and of the return period, and therefore will usually lead to more conservative design values. Example 13.9.

{"paragraph": "13.5.1 Historical information So far in this chapter the different methods of analysis have focused on data that are part of a regular record of measurements carried out for a certain well defined purpose.

Because most hydrologic records are notoriously short, it is desirable to include such information whenever possible. Historical information may be derived from archived documents, or from evidence of a botanical or paleo-event (see Kochel and Baker, 1982; Stedinger and Baker, 1987) nature found in the natural environment. Return periods In practice, inclusion of information from the period prior to the start of the record is concerned with the assignment of a plotting position to each historical event, whose magnitude is known, in order to estimate the return period. As an illustration of pos- sible scenarios for annual floods, consider the three cases discussed by Dalrymple (i) A single historical event, larger than any event during the regular period of record, is known to have occurred earlier. If is the number of years since that historical event or, better, the time since the beginning of recorded historical information, thereturnperiodofthehistoricaleventcanbetakenas(N 1),anditsprobability as 1)].

When the return periods or the corresponding plotting positions are obtained as outlined in the previous two cases (i) and (ii), there is a gap between data points of the regular record and those of the historical events, which causes some difficulty in deriving a best-fit curve. Such difficulty can be avoided, or at least alleviated, by means of Benson’s (1950) procedure; this consists of weight- ing the lesser events (i.e. those below base) of the period of record more heavily by adjusting or “stretching” their order numbers, so that they cover the historical period. Consider to denote the length of the historic period (e.g. the number of years since the first historical information became available until the present), the total number of events above base over that period, the number of events below base during the period of record, and the number of events that cannot be used (e.g. incomplete or missing records due to faulty equipment, etc.) during the period of record. Thus the weight assigned to each of the lesser events is and their adjusted order number is Forexample,iftheregularrecordconsistsofannualobservations,bythisprocedure eachdatapointbelowbaseismadetorepresent yearsinsteadof1y.Theplotting positionsandreturnperiodsofthelessereventscannowbedeterminedasbeforein (cid:6);forinstance,withtheWeibull Section13.2.4butwiththeadjustedordernumberm plotting position, these are 1) and (H 1 The larger events (i.e. those above base) are not weighted, but treated as usual, and their order numbers are not adjusted; thus they are in increasing magnitude Estimation of moments The same weighting method was also recommended in Bulletin 17B (Interagency Advi- soryCommitteeonWaterData,1982)toadjustthemomentsfortheparameterestimation of the generalized log-gamma distribution. From Equation (13.13) it follows immedi- ately that, when the lesser observations are weighted in accordance with (13.87), the elements of frequency analysis in hydrology adjusted moments can be calculated from the data as follows (cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:17) (H 1)(H 2) where the circumflex denotes the adjusted moment, is one of the observations below base during the period of record, and one of the observations above base during the entire historical period to the present. Although commonly used in practice, the weighting method leading to Equation (13.88) for the plotting positions and to Equations (13.89) for the moments has its drawbacks (Hirsch and Stedinger, 1987). Better but more intricate methods have been proposed in the literature to accomplish the same objective. For instance, Cohn al.

{"paragraph": "13.5.2 Regionalization Hydrologic data records are rarely available where they are needed. Moreover, even at the locations where a record is available, it is often too short to allow the reliable determination of the true distribution of the phenomenon of interest. Regional analysis, or regionalization, refers to the extension of available records in space. Its dual objective istoimprovetherecordatregularmeasuringsites,andtoprovideestimatesoffrequency characteristics at sites, where no data are available. In what follows several methods are reviewed which have been found useful in the analysis of flood peaks. Index-flood method Thismethodisprobablytheoldestand,asdescribedbyDalrymple(1960),formanyyears it was the standard procedure used by the US Geological Survey. The underlying idea is thatinahydrologicallyhomogeneousregiontheflooddistributionfunctionsfordifferent streams are similar; in this case similarity means that, when the distribution functions are scaled with their respective index-flood, the resulting dimensionless distributions of all basins in the region can be assumed to have the same shape, which is independent of drainage area and of any other basin characteristics. Accordingly, the method comprises two components. The first component consists of a regional flood frequency curve. To derive this curve, first the flood distribution curve of each streamflow gaging site in the region is made dimensionless, that is normalized, by dividing the flow rates by the extension of available records index-flood of the site; this index-flood is usually taken as the sample mean annual Theregionalfloodfrequencycurveisthenconstructedastheaverageorthemediancurve of the available dimensionless curves. The second component of the method consists of arelationshipbetweenthemagnitudeoftheindex-floodsandeasilyobtainablebasinand climate characteristics. In principle, many different characteristics can be used for this purpose; however, in past practice usually only the drainage area has been considered as the significant characteristic. To summarize, the end products of the analysis of the available flow data are a dimensionless regional frequency curve, and a graph or a regression equation relating the index event with drainage area. These two relationships can then be used to predict the frequency curve for any ungaged catchment. In practical applications, the index event is first estimated from the drainage area of the ungaged catchment, and as mentioned possibly from other relevant characteristics; this index event is used in turn to dimensionalize the regional frequency curve. While the analysis todevelopthesetworelationshipsissimpleinprinciple,italsorequiresadjustmentofall available records to a common base period, normally that of the station with the longest record. Examples of the application of this method can be found in Cruff and Rantz (1965) for coastal basins in California, and in Robison (1961) for New York State. In many studies based on this approach the mean floods, often taken as the events with y (cf. Equation (13.54)), were found to be related to the drainage area by an equation of the power type where and are constants for a hydrologically homogeneous region. For most regions wastypicallyfoundtolieintherangebetweenroughly0.65and1.00;thisisconsistent with Fuller’s (1914) earlier finding in relation to Equation (13.58). The main difficulty experienced in applying the method is that, although tests have been proposed for this purpose, it is not immediately clear how a homogeneous region can be defined or delineated in terms of frequency curves with a similar shape and in terms of hydrologically relevant basin characteristics. A more serious problem is that the frequency is scaled with only one parameter, namely the index event, usually taken as the first moment. Thus it is implicitly assumed that higher moments have no effect, or that these higher moments (when made dimensionless as and ) are constant within the region of hydrologic homogeneity. The limitations of this assumption have investigated (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). Quantile estimation with multiple regression Inthisapproach,firstthefrequencycurvesareconstructedforthestationsforwhichdata areavailablewithintheregionofhydrologichomogeneity.Onallthesefrequencycurves the values of the quantiles are noted at several selected return periods, say, 2 B,C, D,..., relevant basin, climate or other characteristics, as explanatory variables, elements of frequency analysis in hydrology by linear regression in a stepwise manner with an equation of the type b,c,d,..., in which are constants, whose values depend on the return period of the quantile.Characteristicstobeconsideredmayincludedrainagearea,mainchannelslope, main channel length, mean annual precipitation, fraction of area with lakes and ponds, meanannualrunoff, y24hrainfall,meanbasinaltitude,fractionofbasinareacovered with forest, basin shape as ratio of main channel length and area, mean basin elevation, and possibly others. The final selection of the characteristics to be included can be made on the basis of their respective statistical significance and on the basis of the reduction of the standard error caused by their inclusion. The basic idea and early applications of the method to the quantiles of annual floods were described by Benson (1962a, b) and Cruff and Rantz (1965). The method was also explored for other streamflow characteristics, beside the annual maxima, by Thomas and Benson (1970). The quantile regression procedure has subsequently been refined by means of a generalized least squares (GLS) procedure (Tasker and Stedinger, 1986; 1989) to take account of the fact that the stations may have records of unequal lengths and that concurrent observations at different stations may not be independent, but cross- correlated. With these improvements the method has become the main tool of the US Geological Survey to derive the frequency of flood flows for selected return periods on a regional basis in different states. A nationwide summary of the information derived as of 2002 was compiled by Ries and Crouse (2002). However, as more information is becoming available and the streamflow records become longer, the regression equations areperiodicallybeingrevised.Forsomeexamplesofrecentupdatesbystatethereaderis al., 2001). In these more recent studies the frequency relationships for each of the individ- ual gaged sites were commonly derived on the basis of the generalized log-gamma distribution with a regionalized skew. In most cases the delineation of hydrologic regions within the state and the identification of the important explanatory variables for Equation (13.91) were next carried out in a stepwise manner by means of ordinary least squares regression. The regions were usually delineated by inspection of the statewide regression residuals. Once the explanatory variables were identified for each region, the final predictive equations for the different quantiles in terms of the basin characteristics were calculated by means of the GLS procedure, as outlined by Tasker and Stedinger (1989).Theexplanatoryvariablesthatwerefoundtoaffecttheflowpeakquantilesvaried greatly from one region to another, but the number of adopted variables was usually kept as small as possible and restricted to two or three at most. In all regions the size of the drainage was found to be the most important variable and key basin descriptor; for some regions it was actually concluded to be the only significant one (Pope al., 2001; Wiley al., 2000). It has also been suggested on the basis of scaling arguments (Gupta al., 1994) that the sole dependency of on drainage area A, and on nothing else, can be used as the criterion to define a hydrologically homogeneous region. In regions with extension of available records Fig.13.15 Examplesofthedependenceof thecoefficientaT onthereturn period inEquation(13.92) withunitsofm3 for Curve1represents thevaluesforMaineasderived byHodgkins(1999),andcurves 2,3and4representthevalues 4 fortheSandHills,theBlue Ridge–Piedmontandthe CoastalPlainhydrologic regions,respectively,ofNorth 1 10 100 CarolinaasderivedbyPope etal.(2001).

In other regions the secondary variable was the fraction of the area occupied by lakes and wetlands (Hodgkins, 1999). In all past studies the quantiles were found to be related to drainage area by a power function, as in which and are constants depending on the return period of the quantile in question. The order of magnitude and tendency of these constants are illustrated for several regions in Figures 13.15 and 13.16. In most regions the constant lies in the and with the values reported for (13.90). However, is usually not a constant, and typically it decreases with increasing , as illustrated in Figure 13.16. This tendency indicates that the peak flow rate dependency on decreases with increasing severity of the flood; put differently, it means that the runoff per unit area (Q decreases elements of frequency analysis in hydrology more rapidly with increasing size of the drainage area as the severity of the flood increases. As an aside, if Equation (13.92) is valid, it follows that, unless is independent of and is a power function of , the underlying assumption of the power distribution the following criterion for the validity of the power distribution −b10 −b5 Ab100 Ab50 This shows that in this case the ratio in (13.82) depends on the drainage area; in other words, the equality in (13.93) needed for the validity of the power distribution requires a certain size of the basin, so that it is practically never satisfied. For instance, in the case 100km2,theleft-hand ofthetypicalvaluesobtainedforMaine(seeFigure13.16),for km2,theleft-handside sideof(13.93)is1.67,andtheright-handsideis1.82;for 1000 of (13.93) is 1.54 and the right-hand side is 1.65. Theoretical distribution functions with regionalized moments Theunderlyingassumptionofthisapproachisthatthemomentsinahydrologicallyhomo- geneous region depend on known or measurable basin and climate characteristics. Thus, once the moments can be estimated for an ungaged basin within the region on the basis of these characteristics, it becomes possible to calculate the parameters of the selected prob- ability distribution function. In principle, because several moments, namely the mean, the variance and the skew coefficient can be related to basin characteristics, the method is less restrictivethantheindex-floodmethod,whichmakesuseofonlythefirstmoment.Fortwo- parameter distributions the skew is not needed, and for three-parameter distributions, as it tends to be unreliable, a regional value can be assumed. The method has not been widely applied.Forexample,intheirapplicationtotheKlamathMountainsinnorthernCalifornia, Cruff and Rantz (1965) found that the sample mean and the sample standard deviation are both related to the catchment area and to the mean annual basinwide precipitation, respectively, by power functions similar to Equation (13.91).

PROBLEMS", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of regionalization in hydrology, what is the primary objective of regional analysis?", "answer": "The primary objective of regional analysis, or regionalization, is to extend available hydrologic data records in space, aiming to improve the record at regular measuring sites and provide estimates of frequency characteristics at sites where no data are available."}, {"question": "How does the index-flood method approach the problem of scaling flood distributions across different basins?", "answer": "The index-flood method scales flood distributions by assuming that in a hydrologically homogeneous region, the flood distribution functions for different streams are similar when normalized by their respective index-floods, typically taken as the sample mean annual flood. This allows for the construction of a regional flood frequency curve and a relationship between the index-flood and basin characteristics like drainage area."}, {"question": "Why is defining a hydrologically homogeneous region challenging in the context of the index-flood method?", "answer": "Defining a hydrologically homogeneous region is challenging because it requires identifying areas where the frequency curves have a similar shape and where hydrologically relevant basin characteristics are consistent. This challenge arises because the method relies on the assumption that higher moments of the flood distribution, when made dimensionless, are constant within the region, which may not always hold true. Furthermore, tests to delineate such regions are not straightforward, making the definition of homogeneous regions problematic."}, {"question": "In what way does the quantile estimation with multiple regression approach differ from the index-flood method?", "answer": "The quantile estimation with multiple regression approach differs from the index-flood method in that it does not rely solely on the first moment (index-flood) for scaling. Instead, it uses multiple basin and climate characteristics as explanatory variables to estimate quantiles of flood flows for different return periods. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how various factors influence flood frequencies and can provide more accurate predictions, especially when the relationship between flood peaks and drainage area is not the only significant factor."}, {"question": "How does the use of generalized least squares (GLS) procedure improve the quantile regression method?", "answer": "The use of a generalized least squares (GLS) procedure in the quantile regression method improves it by accounting for the unequal lengths of records at different stations and the cross-correlation between concurrent observations at these stations. This refinement makes the method more robust and capable of handling the complexities of real-world hydrologic data, leading to more reliable estimates of flood frequencies for ungaged catchments."}, {"question": "What is the underlying assumption of the approach using theoretical distribution functions with regionalized moments?", "answer": "The underlying assumption of this approach is that the moments in a hydrologically homogeneous region depend on known or measurable basin and climate characteristics. This allows for the estimation of the parameters of a selected probability distribution function for an ungaged basin, based on its characteristics, thereby enabling the calculation of flood frequencies. This method is less restrictive than the index-flood method as it can utilize multiple moments (mean, variance, skew coefficient) related to basin characteristics."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, why is the power distribution's validity dependent on the relationship between the drainage area and the flood peak rate?", "answer": "The power distribution's validity is dependent on the relationship between the drainage area and the flood peak rate because the assumption of the power distribution requires that the ratio of flood peaks for different return periods does not depend on the drainage area. However, if the exponent in the power function relating flood peaks to drainage area changes with the return period, this assumption is violated, indicating that the power distribution may not accurately model flood frequencies across different basin sizes and flood severities."}, {"question": "How do recent studies using the quantile regression method typically derive frequency relationships for individual gaged sites?", "answer": "Recent studies using the quantile regression method typically derive frequency relationships for individual gaged sites by first identifying the important explanatory variables (such as drainage area, precipitation, and basin slope) through stepwise ordinary least squares regression. Then, they use a generalized least squares (GLS) procedure to calculate the final predictive equations for different quantiles in terms of these basin characteristics. This approach allows for the incorporation of regional information and the adjustment for cross-correlation between sites, leading to more accurate and robust flood frequency estimates."}, {"question": "What challenge is associated with the delineation of hydrologic regions within a state for flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The challenge associated with the delineation of hydrologic regions within a state for flood frequency analysis is identifying areas that are hydrologically homogeneous, meaning they have similar flood frequency characteristics and basin characteristics. This is often done by inspecting the residuals of statewide regression analyses, but the process can be subjective and may not always lead to clear boundaries between regions. The delineation of these regions is crucial because it affects the accuracy of flood frequency estimates derived for ungaged catchments within each region."}]}
{"paragraph": "13.7 Multiple choice. Indicate which of the following statements are correct. When a flood of a certain magnitude is called the 50 y event, it means that: (a) the probability that it will be exceeded in any given year is 98%; (b) the probability that it will be exceeded once in any 3 y period is 5.8%; (c) after it has been exceeded, it will take on the average 50 y before it will be exceeded again. (d) it is the largest event that will occur during any period of record of 50 y; (e) the probability that it will be exceeded during the course of a 1 y period is approximately", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flood magnitude classification, what does the term \"50 y event\" signify?", "answer": "The term \"50 y event\" refers to a flood of a certain magnitude, but its specific meaning needs to be understood in terms of probability and recurrence."}, {"question": "How does the probability of exceeding a flood event of a certain magnitude in any given year relate to the concept of a \"50 y event\"?", "answer": "The probability that a \"50 y event\" will be exceeded in any given year is not directly stated as 98%, which is option (a), but rather, the correct interpretation involves understanding the return period and its implications on flood frequency analysis."}, {"question": "Why is option (c) - \"after it has been exceeded, it will take on the average 50 y before it will be exceeded again\" - a common misconception regarding the \"50 y event\"?", "answer": "Option (c) is a misconception because the return period (in this case, 50 years) is a statistical average and does not guarantee that the event will recur after exactly that period. It simply means that, on average, such an event is expected to occur once every 50 years, but the actual time between occurrences can vary significantly due to the natural variability of hydrological processes."}, {"question": "In the context of flood risk assessment, how does understanding the concept of a \"50 y event\" impact decision-making for flood protection measures?", "answer": "Understanding the \"50 y event\" is crucial for flood risk assessment because it helps in evaluating the likelihood of floods of certain magnitudes. This knowledge is essential for designing and implementing flood protection measures, such as levees, dams, and floodplain management strategies, which must balance the level of protection with the cost and feasibility of the measures. The concept of return periods like the \"50 y event\" allows planners to quantify and manage flood risk more effectively, ensuring that infrastructure and communities are adequately prepared for potential flood events."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the probability of a flood event being exceeded in any given year and the concept of return period, as implied by the \"50 y event\"?", "answer": "The return period (e.g., 50 years) is inversely related to the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of a flood event. For a \"50 y event,\" the AEP is 1/50 or 2%, meaning there is a 2% chance that the flood event will be exceeded in any given year. This relationship is fundamental in hydrology for assessing flood risks and designing flood mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "How does the statement in option (d) - \"it is the largest event that will occur during any period of record of 50 y\" - misrepresent the concept of a \"50 y event\"?", "answer": "Option (d) misrepresents the \"50 y event\" because it implies a certainty that the event is the largest within a 50-year period, which is not what the term signifies. The \"50 y event\" is about the probability of occurrence, not the guarantee of being the largest event within a specific timeframe. The largest event in a 50-year record could be much larger than the \"50 y event\" if it occurs less frequently."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological planning, why is it essential to distinguish between the actual occurrence of a flood event and its return period, as exemplified by the \"50 y event\"?", "answer": "Distinguishing between the actual occurrence of a flood event and its return period is essential because it allows hydrologists and planners to manage expectations and prepare for potential future events. The return period gives a statistical expectation of how often an event might occur, but it does not predict when the next event will happen. This distinction is critical for long-term planning, infrastructure design, and public awareness campaigns, ensuring that communities are prepared for floods without creating unnecessary alarm or complacency."}, {"question": "How does the concept of a \"50 y event\" relate to the probability that it will be exceeded once in any 3 y period, as mentioned in option (b)?", "answer": "The probability that a \"50 y event\" will be exceeded once in any 3-year period can be calculated using the binomial probability formula, considering the annual exceedance probability (2% for a 50-year event). However, option (b) states this probability as 5.8%, which would need to be verified through calculation to confirm its accuracy in relation to the \"50 y event\" concept."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the probability of a flood event, such as the \"50 y event,\" crucial for water resources management and planning?", "answer": "Understanding the probability of flood events like the \"50 y event\" is crucial because it informs the design and operation of water infrastructure, such as dams and levees, and guides floodplain management policies. It helps in balancing the risks associated with flood events"}]}

highest frequency, implying that larger events are less frequent but still certain to occur within a given timeframe."}, {"question": "How does the method for obtaining the frequency of annual floods relate to the concept of return period?", "answer": "The method involves using the ratio m/n = P (where m is the smallest and n is the largest) to calculate the frequency of annual floods, which is

analysis method limited, according to the given options?", "answer": "The method can be applied only to small samples, as stated in option (e), implying limitations in its applicability to larger datasets or more extensive hydrological analyses."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the statement that the probability of the largest event is equivalent to the assumption that a larger event cannot occur?", "answer": "This statement implies that the method for calculating flood frequencies assumes that the largest event considered is the maximum possible event, and any event larger than this is considered impossible or highly unlikely, which has significant implications for flood risk assessment and management."}, {"question": "How does the concept of return period in flood frequency analysis account for the uncertainty of extreme events?", "answer": "The return period, by definition, provides a measure of the average time interval between occurrences of an event of a given magnitude, thereby accounting for the uncertainty of extreme events by quantifying their likelihood of occurrence over time, although it does not eliminate the uncertainty associated with rare, high-magnitude events."}, {"question": "Why is the return period of the largest event in flood frequency analysis set as twice the period of record?", "answer": "The return period of the largest event is set as twice the period of record because this setting provides a conservative estimate, ensuring that the largest event considered is rare enough to be significant but not so rare that it falls outside the bounds of historical data, thus balancing the need for caution with the limitations of available data."}, {"question": "In the context of flood risk management, what are the implications of assuming certainty of larger events based on the probability of smaller events?", "answer": "Assuming certainty of larger events based on the probability of smaller events can lead to underestimation of flood risks if the relationship between event sizes does not hold as assumed, potentially resulting in inadequate preparation and mitigation strategies, highlighting the need for careful consideration of hydrological data and analysis methods in flood risk assessment."}, {"question": "How does the method for obtaining the frequency of annual floods using m/n = P account for the variability in flood magnitudes?", "answer": "The method accounts for variability in flood magnitudes by using the ratio of the smallest to the largest event (m/n) to calculate the probability (P), which inherently considers the range of flood sizes, thus providing a way to quantify the likelihood of different magnitudes of flooding events."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in applying flood frequency analysis to real-world scenarios, as implied by the given options?", "answer": "The challenges include the limitation to small samples, the assumption of certainty of larger events based on smaller ones, and the potential underestimation of extreme events, all of which can impact the accuracy and reliability of flood risk assessments and management strategies, requiring careful consideration of these limitations in practical applications."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the return period crucial in hydrological analyses, particularly in the context of flood frequency?", "answer": "Understanding the return period is crucial because it provides a quantitative measure of the likelihood of flood events, allowing for the assessment of flood risks, the design of flood protection infrastructure, and the development of flood mitigation strategies, all of which are critical for protecting human life, property, and the environment from the impacts of flooding."}, {"question": "How does the concept of probability in flood frequency analysis relate to the occurrence of extreme events?", "answer": "The concept of probability in flood frequency analysis relates to the occurrence of extreme events by quantifying their likelihood, with lower probability events being less frequent but potentially more severe, thus highlighting the importance of

{"paragraph": "14.1 EARLIEST CONCEPTS: THE ATMOSPHERIC WATER CYCLE For as long as humans have been on Earth, they must have been acutely aware of their dependency on different forms of water in their environment. Water was literally vital for their health and sustenance but it could also be destructive and even lethal in severe weather,floods,andtheotherhazardstheyfacedintheirdailylives.Alreadyintheearliest writings there are indications that among natural peoples in their primal stage it was a common notion that water in nature moves continually between different states in some repetitive, if not cyclical, fashion. Whatever is left of these early writings is not always easy to interpret, mainly because the meanings of even the most elementary concepts have evolved in the meantime. Nor is it always easy to distinguish profane views and naturalistic descriptions from the more sacred narratives and religious interpretations. Nevertheless,acursoryscanofsomebetterknownearlywritingsyieldsseveralinstances of water related imagery even in widely different cultural settings, in which the evidence is fairly clear, and which provide some idea on the thinking of early humans. AsearlyastheeighthcenturyBCEinGreece,thepoetHesiodpresentedaremarkable description. In a passage with advice to farmers to get dressed warmly and to finish the For the morning is cold when Boreas [the north wind] bears down; in the morning from the starry skyovertheearthafertilizingmistspreadsoverthecultivationsofthefortunate;this[mist],drawn from ever flowing rivers, and lifted high above the earth by a storm wind, sometimes falls as rain toward evening, or sometimes blows as wind, while Thracian Boreas chases the heavy clouds. This passage contains interesting features; it explains that mist is derived from river water, and that it may lead to rain; on the other hand, it implies that evaporation may be both a result and a cause of the wind. Apart from the reference to Boreas, the god of the north wind, Hesiod’s passage appears quite naturalistic. Several water cycle related passages appear in the Hebrew Bible. The oldest among as follows (see, for example, Edition, 1976). Oxford Study He...whoturneddarknessintomorninganddarkeneddayintonight;whosummonedthewaters of the sea, and poured them over the earth; . . . he whodoes this, his name is the Lord. Amos, a native of Judah, was by his own account originally a shepherd and a pruner of sycamore fig trees. From the context, that is from the first part of this quotation which refers to the cycle of day and night, it is possible that the second part refers to some kind afterword of cyclical process as well; but if so, it is a cyclicity in the sense of periodicity and not in the sense of a water cycle. Here also, rain over the Earth results from evaporation from Book of Isaiah, namely, the following. This is the very word of the Lord . . . and as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return until they have watered the earth, making it blossom and bear fruit, and give seed for sowing and bread to eat, so shall the word which comes from my mouth prevail; it shall not return to me fruitless without accomplishing my purpose or succeeding in the task I gave it. Isaiah also lived in the eighth century BCE but this chapter is now generally considered a later addition and attributed to an unknown prophet, who wrote in Babylon toward the end of the exile in the sixth century BCE. In this passage the physical phenomena serve mainly an allegorical purpose and their description is fairly naturalistic; they appear to occur on their own and not as a result of direct divine intervention. The description involves unambiguously some kind of cycle by which water returns to where it came Notions on various cyclical processes were also held in ancient China. In a naturalist atmospheric phenomena are described as follows.

{"paragraph": "14.2.1 The Presocratics The earliest Greek philosophers who were active in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE are customarily referred to as the Presocratics. Some of their writings were handed down to us in the form of fragments and some were paraphrased by later writers. Among these natural philosopherstwocompetingtheoriesprevailedontheoriginofthewaterinsprings,streams, and other fresh water bodies. These are the seawater filtration theory, which was probably the earlier of the two, and the rainfall percolation theory, which contains the essence of our present understanding. Seawater filtration theory The basic idea of this theory is that seawater seeps upward through the Earth, loses its salt by filtration and becomes the source of the springs and other surface waters (Figure 14.1). The written evidence points to Hippon as the earliest proponent of this view. Hippon of Rhegion,inwhatisnowsouthernItaly,alsocalledHipponofSamos,wasacontemporaryof Pericles,sohemusthaveflourishedaroundthemiddleofthefifthcenturyBCE.Hisopinion on the matter, in the only surviving fragment by him (Diels, 1961, p. 388) is formulated as follows.

Thisfragmentisratherterseandnotveryexplicit.However,itshouldbeseeninlightofthe factthatHippon’sotherviewswerenearlyidenticalwiththoseofThales,presentedatleast a century earlier. The following passage by Theophrastos in his (Diels, Physical Opinions 1879, p. 475) is revealing. Of those who say that the original principle (arche) is one and movable, whom he (Aristotle) calls physicists, some contend that it is bounded; for instance, Thales of Miletos and Hippon, who appears evento(have)becomeanatheist,saidthatwateristhefirstprinciple,beingledtothisbytheobservation ofthephenomena;forheatthrivesinmoisture,deadmatterdriesout,theseedsofeverythingaremoist, andallfoodissucculent;andnaturallyeachthingisnourishedbythatfromwhichitoriginates.Water is the principle of the moisture and the bond of everything.

Thales of Miletos in Ionia flourished around 585 BCE, and he is generally considered to be the first Greek natural philosopher, with whom the formal inquiry started into the reality behind the changes in the Universe. He does not appear to have committed his ideas to writing, and no actual quotations of him have survived. While there is nothing on the origin of rivers or springs, the essence of Thales’ views is well known and two of the most important ones are contained in the above passage; these are that the first principle of everything is water, and that the Earth rests on water. Hippon is mentioned here in the same breath as Thales, so it would be surprising if Hippon’s opinion on the origin of rivers were very different from that of the old master. It is, therefore, difficult to dis- agree with Gilbert’s (1907) opinion that Thales can reasonably be considered, as the actual originator of the seawater filtration theory, at least among the Greeks. But the roots of this theory may actually be much older. It is now known (see Eliade, 1978) that as early as the third millennium BCE, that is some 2000 years before Thales, in Sumer in lower Mesopotamia it was already a well established view that the Earth rests on the Hippon’sfragmentdoesnotmentiontheremovalofthesalt.Butthisaspectofthetheory theory, some 200 years later. It was this difficulty which led people to suppose that the sea was the primary source of moisture and of all water. So some say that rivers not only flow into it but out of it, and that the salt water becomes drinkablebybeingfiltered. This is a clear indication that the theory was around at the time of Aristotle and that it was taken seriously by many of his contemporaries. Rainfall percolation theory The earliest seeds of this second theory appear in the philosophical views of Anaximander of Miletos; Anaximander, a younger associate of Thales, was born around 610 BCE, and must have been in his prime around 565 BCE. While the issue of the origin of streams and rivers is not addressed directly, his main views can be deduced from the remaining evidence(seealsoGilbert,1907,p.405).Onthenatureandtheoriginofthesea,Alexander of Aphrodisias, a well-known commentator, who flourished around 200 CE, summarized Anaximander’s views as follows (Diels, 1879, p. 494). greek antiquity Some of them (natural philosophers) say that the sea is the leftover of the original moisture. As the region around the earth was wet, the first of that moisture was evaporated by the sun and became the winds,andfromittheturningsofthesunandofthemoonaswell;thus,astheturningsarecausedby thesamevaporsandbytheirexhalations,itbecomesthentheproviderofthesame(moisture)forthose revolving around them. The part of it (the moisture) that is left behind in the hollow places is the sea; therefore,itdecreases,asitiscontinuallyevaporatedbythesun,andeventuallyitwillperhapshaveto bedry.AnaximanderandDiogenes(ofApollonia)arrivedatthisview,thusreportsTheophrastos. Anaximander’s opinion on what happens to this continual evaporation was summarized by Hippolytus, a Christian writer of the early third century, who died in 235 CE; in his Refutation Windsaregeneratedwhenthefinestvaporsoftheairareseparatedoffandwhenevertheyareputinto motionastheygather;rainsaregeneratedfromthevaporthatisreleasedupwardfromtheearthbythe These two passages indicate that Anaximander considered the sea to be the remainder of theoriginalwateraroundtheEarth;theevaporationfromtheseaisthecause,insteadofthe result, of the winds and also the cause of the rains. There is no specific mention of streams. Anaximanderdidnotassume,asThalesdid,thattheEarthfloatsonwater,whichwouldthen flowupwardtothesurfacetofeedspringsandstreams;instead,heisknowntohaveposited that the Earth does not rest on anything and that it is suspended in the sky in some sort of equilibrium, because it is equidistant from everything on all sides. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have assumed that the sea feeds the streams by some upward filtration, as asserted by Thales and Hippon. Rather, it would seem more natural in his scheme that it is a different source of water, perhaps rainwater, which is feeding the streams that flow into thesea.Ontheotherhand,itisclearthathedidnotthinkthatalltheevaporatedwaterends up in streams and rivers, because the sea is gradually drying out; thus, he definitely did not propose a closed cycle. In any event, he seems to have started, or at least stimulated, a productive line of thought, as can be seen from the views of Xenophanes. Xenophanes of Colophon (c. BCE) was probably in his prime c. 530 BCE, which is roughly some 35 years after Anaximander. According to Aetius (in Diels, 1879, (Mansfeld and Runia, 1997), Xenophanes said that . . . what happens in the sky is caused by the heat of the sun; for, when the moisture is drawn out of the sea, the sweet part, which is distinguished by its fine texture, forms a cloud, and drips out as rain bycompressionlikethatoffelt,andthewindsvaporizeitaround.Andhewroteemphatically (an actual fragment follows in verse, Diels,1961, p. 136) Theseaisthesourceofthewater,thesourceofthewind.Forintheclouds,neitherwouldtheforceof thewind,whichblowsoutward,originatewithoutthegreatsea,northeflowingofthestreams,northe rainwaterfromthesky;butthegreatseaisthegeneratoroftheclouds,windsandstreams.... Regarding the saltiness of the sea, the opinion of Xenophanes is described by Hippolytus Theseaissalty,hesays,becauseofthemanyadmixtureswhichflowtogetherintoit. All this indicates that Xenophanes had some idea of the hydrologic cycle, as we now know it. He not only includes streams in his description, but he specifies that together with the winds, with the rain and with the clouds, the streams are caused by the evaporation from the sea. The only possible interpretation is that this occurs indirectly through the rain on the land surface. This is further supported by his explanation that the saltiness of the sea is afterword Fig.14.2 SketchoftherainfallpercolationtheoryofthePresocraticphilosophersinancientGreeceon theoriginofrivers.Theconceptappearstohaveevolvedfromroughbutseminalideasby Anaximander,followedbymorecompleteformulationsbyXenophanesandAnaxagoras. causedbythestreamswhichflowintoitcarryingdifferentsaltyadmixturespickedupalong the way. Clearly, the views of Xenophanes are a further development of Anaximander’s. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (c. 500–428 BCE), who came some 70 years after Xeno- phanes, appears to have been even more explicit on the matter. It is again from Hippolytus ...thattheseabegantoexistfromthemoistpartsontheearth,thatitoriginatedthiswayasthewaters initwerebeingevaporatedorsettleddown,andalsofromthedownflowingrivers;thattheriverstake their substance from the rains and out of the waters that are in the earth; for this is hollow and that it haswaterinthecaves. ButthemostsolidproofthatAnaximander,Xenophanes,Anaxagorasandperhapsother Presocratics developed the notion, that the origin of streams and rivers can be accounted for by rain (see Figure 14.2), is found in its attempted refutation by Aristotle in his Meteorologica, some one to two centuries later. Evidently, at the time of Aristotle, the rainfall percolation theory was well enough established, that he considered it necessary to mount a head-on attack against it. Aristotle (1952, I 349 b,2) summarized the theory as follows. Some people hold similar views about the origin of rivers. They suppose that the water drawn up by the sun when it falls again as rain is collected beneath the earth into a great hollow from which the rivers flow, either all from the same one or each from a different one: no additional water is formed in the process, and the rivers are supplied by the water collected during the winter in these reservoirs. This explains why rivers always run higher in winter than in summer, and why some are perennial, some are not. When the hollow is large and the amount of water collected therefore great enough to last out and not be exhausted before the return of the winter rains, then rivers are perennial and flow continuously:whenthereservoirsaresmaller,then,becausethesupplyofwaterissmall,riversdryup beforetherainyweatherreturnstoreplenishtheemptycontainer. The statement, that “no additional water is formed in the process,” is a clear indication that the rainfall percolation theory had eventually led to the concepts of a water cycle and of water mass conservation. From the space devoted to it in Aristotle’s Meteorologica, the rainfall percolation theory was undoubtedly the more widely accepted at the time. Both Anaxagoras and Aristotle refer to caves and hollows as the main underground storage spaces of water. This should not be surprising.

Xenophanes further developed this idea by suggesting that the streams are caused by the evaporation from the sea, which occurs indirectly through the rain on the land surface.

This stored water then supplies the rivers, either all from the same one or each from a different one, and explains why rivers always run higher in winter than in summer.

{"paragraph": "14.2.2 Aristotle It is generally agreed that Greek philosophy culminated with Aristotle (c. 384–322 BCE). Eventhoughinantiquityhewasacclaimedmoreasalogicianthanasanaturalphilosopher, his influence over the ensuing 18 centuries was to be so large, that it is necessary briefly to review his ideas here. On the origin of rivers and springs AfterhavingdescribedthePresocraticrainfallpercolationtheoryinthepreviousquotation, he immediately proceeds to present his own view (Aristotle, 1952, I 349 b,16). But it is evident that if anyone tries to compute the volume of water constantly flowing each day and thentovisualizeareservoirforit,hewillseethattocontainthewholeyearlyflowofwateritwillhave tobeaslargeastheearthinsizeoratleastnotsomuchsmaller. And though it is true that there are many such reservoirs in different parts of the earth, yet it is absurd for anyone not to suppose that the same cause operates to turn air into water below the earth as above it. If then cold condenses vaporous air into water above the earth, the cold beneath the earth mustbepresumedtoproducethesameeffect.Sonotonlydoeswaterformseparatelywithintheearth andflowfromit,buttheprocessiscontinuous. Aristotle does not reject the rainfall percolation mechanism altogether; but he feels that the available underground storage and the amount of rain are inadequate to supply the observed river flows, so that there must be another important mechanism at work. That mechanism is the formation of water out of vaporous air beneath the Earth’s surface (see Figure 14.3). Aristotle is correct in that water vapor does condense under the ground in caves; they are often wet and damp and water can be seen to drip from their walls and ceilings.Itisnowknown,however,thattheamountsproducedthiswayareverysmall,and thatregularprecipitationexceedsbyfaranykindofcondensationbeneaththesurfaceasthe water supply for springs and streams. Compared to the rainfall theory of the Presocratics, Aristotle’s explanation is definitely a step backward in the development of hydrologic has presented his argument strongly or clearly enough, because he continues as follows. afterword Besides, even if one leaves out of account water so produced and considers only the daily supply of wateralreadyexisting,thisdoesnotactasasourceofriversbysegregatingintosubterraneanlakes,as it were, in the way some people maintain: the process is rather like that in which small drops form in theregionabovetheearth,andtheseagainjoinothers,untilrainwaterfallsinsomequantity;similarly inside the earth quantities of water, quite small at first, collect together and gush out of the earth, as it were,atasinglepointandformthesourcesofrivers.Apracticalproofofthisisthatwhenmenmake irrigation works they collect the water in pipes and channels, as though the higher parts of the earth were sweating it out. So we find that the sources of rivers flow from mountains, and that the largest andmostnumerousriversflowfromthehighestmountains.Similarlythemajorityofspringsareinthe neighborhood of mountains and high places, and there are few sources of water in the plains except rivers.

Aristotleconcludestheparagraphbysummarizingonceagainhisownopinion:springsand the sources of rivers result both from rainfall and from condensation inside the Earth. On why the sea does not overflow Beside the origin of rivers, Aristotle also concerned himself with the problem why the sea The place occupied by the sea is, as we say, the proper place of water, which is why all rivers and all thewaterthereisrunintoit:forwaterflowstothedeepestplace,andtheseaoccupiesthedeepestplace on earth. But one part of it is all quickly drawn up by the sun, while the other for the reasons given is left behind. The old difficulty why so great an amount of water disappears (for the sea becomes no largereventhoughinnumerableriversofimmensesizeareflowingintoiteveryday)isquiteanatural onetoask,butnotdifficulttoanswerwithalittlethought.Forthesameamountofwaterdoesnottake the same time to dry up if it is spread out as if it is concentrated in a small space: the difference is so greatthatintheonecaseitmayremainforawholeday,intheother,ifforinstanceonespillsacupof wateroveralargetable,itwillvanishasquickasthought.Thisiswhathappenswithrivers:theygoon flowinginaconstrictedspaceuntiltheyreachaplaceofvastareawhentheyspreadoutandevaporate rapidlyandimperceptively. He calls it an “old difficulty,” so it must have been a problem of long standing in Greek philosophy; indeed as seen earlier, Anaximander had already thought about it and had concludedthattheseamayeventuallydryupaltogether.WhileAristotleseemstohavebeen the first on record to resolve the issue successfully by providing the correct explanation, it was considered elsewhere as well. For instance, it appears to have been of concern in ancient China (see Lin, 1949). In the Zhuang Zi (or Chuangtse, d. 275 BCE), raised the issue, as follows. There is no body of water beneath the canopy of heaven which is greater than the ocean. All streams pourintoitwithoutcease,yetitdoesnotoverflow.ItisbeingcontinuallydrainedoffattheTail-Gate, yetitisneverempty.Springandautumnbringnochange;floodsanddroughtsareequallyunknown. greek antiquity is a mythical hole in the bottom or end of the ocean; this depletion mechanism to balance theriverinflowsisclearlydifferentfromtheHippon–Thalesseawaterfiltrationmechanism and from Aristotle’s evaporation. The same issue was touched upon in the book L¨ (or Lu-Shih-Chun-Chiu), written a few decades later during the Qin (or Chin) dynasty by a team of scholars under Prime Minister L¨ u Bu Wei (or Lu Buwei, d. 235 BCE) 1959, p. 467). The waters flow eastwards from their sources, resting neither by day nor by night.

Thetermswithinbracketsprobablyrepresenttheinterpretationofthetextbythetranslators; butthisinterpretationisnotunreasonableanditwouldbedifficulttocomeupwithadifferent meaning. Thus here the invoked evaporation mechanism is the same as Aristotle’s, and the authors clearly have some kind of hydrologic cycle in mind. The problem was to continue to receive much attention throughout Western history, and this preoccupation stemmed directly from (1, 7) in Ecclesiastes (Oxford Edition, 1976) as follows Allstreamsrunintothesea,yettheseaneveroverflows;backtotheplacefromwhichthestreamsran theyreturntorunagain. Ecclesiastes dates from the third century, about a century after the death of Aristotle and of Alexander (the Great), when Hellenistic influences had been spreading like wildfire all overtheMediterraneanworld.ThefirstpartofthispassageissoreminiscentofAristotle’s, that one has to wonder if the author of Ecclesiastes somehow had not been affected by Greek ideas. Ecclesiastes, like all the other Wisdom books, probably originated in the Jewish diaspora following the Babylonian exile, and possibly even in Alexandria, the very center of Hellenism. To be sure, the book is generally acknowledged to be quite different in literary style from the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, and it has even been said that some ancient rabbis were distressed by its pessimism. On the other hand, however, the description in the second part is not quite the same as the explanation given by Aristotle. Aristotle unequivocally attributes the fact that the sea does not overflow to evaporation; in Ecclesiastes the way by which “they return” is not specified, but one cannot help inferring some kind of seawater filtration mechanism. At any rate, this passage shows that the “old difficulty” was of concern in Judaism. This preoccupation was also shared later by most Christian writers, and it was to endure well into the Middle Ages. But the theme kept recurring: Dobson (1777) contended that his data supported the wisdom in this biblical passage and, as recently as 1877, Huxley (1900, p. 74) used the passage in his description of the hydrologic cycle.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of Aristotle's theory on the origin of rivers and springs, what mechanism does he propose as an additional source of water besides rainfall percolation?", "answer": "Aristotle proposes the formation of water out of vaporous air beneath the Earth's surface as an additional mechanism, suggesting that cold beneath the earth condenses vaporous air into water, similar to the process above the earth."}, {"question": "Why does Aristotle argue that the available underground storage and the amount of rain are inadequate to supply the observed river flows?", "answer": "Aristotle argues that if one tries to compute the volume of water constantly flowing each day and then visualizes a reservoir for it, the reservoir would have to be as large as the earth in size to contain the whole yearly flow of water, indicating that rainfall percolation alone cannot account for the observed river flows."}, {"question": "How does Aristotle explain the phenomenon of the sea not overflowing despite the constant influx of rivers?", "answer": "Aristotle explains that the sea does not overflow because the water that flows into it is quickly drawn up by the sun through evaporation.

Moreover, for several centuries their writings were the only source of ancient philosophy available in Western Europe; they are therefore an indispensable background to understand and trace the thought currents that brought about the scientific revolution. The views of Lucretius (c. 99–55 BCE) in his work provide a revealing On Nature exampleofsomeaspectsofnaturalphilosophyinRome.InthefollowingpassageLucretius (1924, V, 261) deals with the problem of why the sea does not overflow and with the origin of springs.

But, bit by bit, whatever comes first of the water is taken off, and the result is that there is no excess of liquid in the sum total: partly because strong winds sweep the surface and diminish it, as does the sun on high unraveling it with his rays; partly because it is distributed abroad through all the earth underneath; for the pungency is strained off, and the substance of the water seeps back, and all meets atthesourcesofeachriver,whenceitreturnsovertheearthinacolumnofsweetwateralongthepath whichhasoncebeencutforitinitsliquidcourse. A more elaborate but similar account is given in VI, 608–638. In contrast to Aristotle’s explanation,evaporationisnottheonlyreasonwhytheseadoesnotoverflow;seawateralso flowsbackundergroundtofeedthesprings,inaccordancewiththeoriginaltheoryofHippon and Thales. Also in contrast to Aristotle, who only considered the sun (Brutsaert, 1982), the latin era Lucretius allows for the wind to be involved in the evaporation process. One of Lucretius’ aims in writing his book was to promulgate the doctrines of Epikouros, whose natural philosophy,inturn,wasderivedfromtheatomictheoryofDemokritosandLeukippos;this passagefullyreflectsthis.Themainprinciplesofthistheoryarethatnothingcanbecreated out of nothing (or vice versa), which is equivalent with the principle of mass conservation, and that everything is made up of indivisible particles. This explains his view that on the whole there is no excess of water over the original amount, and that the winds are capable of sweeping water particles by evaporation. Unfortunately, beside the works of Lucretius and of Diogenes Laertius (1925) (third century CE), little is left that might give a better idea of what the Greek atomists themselves thought about these hydrologic phenomena. A completely different example of Roman thought is the comprehensive treatise on architecturebyVitruvius(MarcusV.Pollio),acontemporaryofLucretiusinthefirstcentury BCE.HecomposeditafterhavingservedasamilitaryengineerunderJuliusCaesarinGaul and in Spain. On the generation of spring water he wrote (see Vitruve, 1986, 8, 1) the following. Wesee,infact,thattherainwaterscongregateinthehollowsfoundathigherlevelsinthemountains, wherethetrees,whichgrowthereingreatnumber,keepthesnowforalongtimeandwhere,asitmelts little by little, it flows out imperceptibly through the veins of the earth; it is this water which, after it reachesthefootofthemountains,producesspringsthere. Vitruvius is explicit and specific in attributing springs to rain water and snowmelt which, after infiltrating into the ground, flow out at lower levels. He undoubtedly gained this insight during his military campaigns up north in Gaul, where rainfall and all kinds of seepageoutflowphenomenafromhillsidesaremoreobviousandmoreplentifulthaninthe more arid Mediterranean regions. Similarly, the writings of Seneca (c. 4 CE), born in Cordoba, and teacher and later advisor of Emperor Nero, also give a good idea of the status of natural philosophy amongeducatedRomans.InhisworkNaturalQuestionshequotedsome40references,five among them Latin authors, but the remainder Greek. Book Three is devoted to the waters of the earth. He successively discusses five theories on “. . . how the earth supplies the continuous flow of rivers, and where such great quantities of water come from” (Seneca, a river, the same will be so of streams and springs.” In brief, these five theories are (i) the seawater enters the land by hidden paths (that is why the sea does not increase) and is filtered of its salinity while in transit; (ii) whatever rainfall the Earth receives is sent out again through the rivers; (iii) rivers are supplied by primal fresh water in vast underground reservoirs; (iv) within the deep cavities inside the Earth the stagnant cold air ceases to maintain itself and changes into water; (v) “. . . all elements come from all others: air from therearenoprecedentsofthisfifththeory,sothismustbeSeneca’sown.Thefirsttwoare,of course, the theories of the Presocratics, the third apparently a cleaned up version of Plato’s Tartarus theory, and the fourth Aristotle’s underground condensation theory. While Seneca seems to be willing to admit more than one theory, he is totally opposed to the rainfall percolation mechanism. Because Seneca was to exert such a profound influence on later Itisobviousthatmuchcanbesaidagainstthistheory.Firstofall,asadiligentvine-gardenermyselfI assure you that no rainfall is so heavy it wets the ground to a depth beyond ten feet.

It is obvious that they are forced up or are formed on thespot,sinceallrainwaterrunsdown. Seneca apparently admits that most rainwater makes its way to river channels, but he feels that this is a short-lived phenomenon and that these quantities are insufficient to maintain a continuous river flow. He bases this argument on observations in his vineyards, which are certainly perceptive, and similar to the findings of Perrault and de LaHire in the late seventeenth century, as will be seen below. In the later stages of the Roman era Judaic and Christian views gradually gained in influence. In their writings the fathers, or early leaders, of the Christian church displayed a broad knowledge both of biblical accounts and of classical philosophy. But in their eclec- ticism among the different philosophical concepts they invariably accepted only those that couldbereconciledwiththebiblicalnarrative.ThesetofhomiliesOntheHexaemeron,i.e. this. Basileios had been educated in the classical tradition at Caesarea, Constantinople and Athens, and his writings generally reflect this background. In reference to Genesis (I,1,9) Forthisreason,accordingtothesayingofEcclesiastes‘Alltheriversrunintothesea,yettheseadoth not overflow.’ It is through the divine command that waters flow, and it is due to that first legislation, ‘Letthewatersbegatheredintooneplace,’thattheseaisenclosedwithinboundaries.Lesttheflowing water,spreadingbeyondthebedswhichholdit,alwayspassingonandfillinguponeplaceafteranother, shouldcontinuouslyfloodallthelands,itwasorderedtobegatheredintooneplace. Then, in (4, 6) he had this to say on the origin of rivers and springs. In the first place, the water of the sea is the source of all the moisture of the earth. This water passing throughunseenminuteopenings,asisprovedbythespongyandcavernouspartsofthemainlandinto which the swift sea flows in narrow channels, is received in the curved and sinuous paths and hurried on by the wind which sets it into motion. Then, it breaks through the surface and is carried outside; and,havingeliminateditsbitternessbypercolation,itbecomesdrinkable. Evidently, Basileios judged that among all available theories, the Hippon–Thales view was the main one in harmony with the creation events in Genesis and with the water cycle in Ecclesiastes. Similar views were promulgated some seventeen years later, around 389, by Ambrosius (c. 333–397) in his own Hexameron, which was partly inspired by that of Basileios. Ambrosius was then Bishop of Milan, but he had been converted to Christianity only at the age of 41, and his early education had been in the classical Latin tradition of 5, 22) are nearly the same as those of Basileios. The writings of Basileios and Ambrosius show how the fundamental concept of natural philosophy, as Thales had initiated it, was retained. Thus the Greek tradition of searching for an explanation of the physical world within that same world, without animistic or direct divine intervention, was continued. But the latin era the emphasis had shifted somewhat, since this knowledge had to serve as an aid for the transmission of the Christian doctrine and as an illustration of the wisdom of the Creator.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of Roman contributions to natural philosophy, how did Lucretius' views on the origin of springs and the sea not overflowing differ from Aristotle's explanation?", "answer": "Lucretius' views differed from Aristotle's in that he allowed for seawater to flow back underground to feed springs, in accordance with the original theory of Hippon and Thales, and also considered the wind's role in evaporation, whereas Aristotle only considered the sun's effect. This difference highlights the diversity of thought among ancient philosophers regarding hydrological processes.

He argued that the amount of water absorbed by the earth is scanty and that the ground either uses up what is poured into it or, if saturated, pours off any excess. This reasoning is similar to findings by Perrault and de LaHire in the late seventeenth century, indicating a historical continuity in the critique of rainfall percolation as a primary mechanism for river flow."}, {"question": "In the context of ancient theories on the origin of rivers and springs, what were the five theories discussed by Seneca, and how did they reflect the philosophical views of his time?", "answer": "Seneca discussed five theories: (i) seawater enters the land by hidden paths and is filtered of its salinity; (ii) rainfall is sent out again through rivers; (iii) rivers are supplied by primal fresh water in vast underground reservoirs; (iv) stagnant cold air inside the Earth changes into water; and (v) all elements come from all others. These theories reflect a mix of Presocratic, Platonic, Aristotelian, and possibly Seneca's own philosophical views, demonstrating the eclectic nature of natural philosophy among educated Romans. Seneca's willingness to consider multiple theories, while rejecting the rainfall percolation mechanism, showcases the critical and inquiring spirit of Roman thinkers in their pursuit of understanding hydrological phenomena."}, {"question": "How did the views of Basileios and Ambrosius on the origin of rivers and springs reflect the influence of Christian doctrine on natural philosophy in the late Roman era?", "answer": "Basileios and Ambrosius, influenced by Christian doctrine, retained the fundamental concept of natural philosophy initiated by Thales but shifted the emphasis to serve as an aid for the transmission of Christian doctrine and to illustrate the wisdom of the Creator. They promulgated views similar to the Hippon–Thales theory, where the water of the sea is the source of all moisture, passing through unseen openings into the mainland, and eventually becoming drinkable after percolation. This integration of natural philosophy with Christian teachings demonstrates how the explanation of physical phenomena was adapted to align with religious narratives, reflecting the evolving intellectual landscape of the late Roman era."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological processes, what role did Lucretius attribute to the wind in the evaporation of water, and how did this differ from Aristotle's perspective?", "answer": "Lucretius attributed a significant role to the wind in the evaporation of water, suggesting that strong winds sweep the surface of the water, diminishing it and contributing to evaporation. This perspective differs from Aristotle's, who only considered the sun's effect on evaporation.

And then Solomon says: the streams return to wheretheycomefrom. From which it can be understood that the sea does not increase also because, after being returned to their sources through some conduits hidden in the deep, the waters flow back and run back along the usual course through their rivers. But the sea was made purposely so it would receive the runs of all rivers. While its depth is variable, the equality of its surface, however, cannot be discerned. As a result, it is believed that it is called a plain, because its surface is even. But the physicists say that the seaishigherthantheland. ThetitleofIsidore’sbookisnearlythesameasthatofLucretius;also,asnotedbyFontaine (inIsidore,1960)itsoutlineisinmanyplacessimilartothoseofAristotle,Lucretius,Pliny and Aetius. So to organize his subject matter, Isidore must have had some doxographic references at his disposal, or at least a monastery school manual of such material. But it is striking how in this particular instance, Isidore’s treatment on the origin of streams comes closest to the opinion of Lucretius, quoted earlier. (Note that in the past Ecclesiastes has often, evidently mistakenly, been attributed to Solomon). Less than a decade later around Therefore, the reason why the sea does not increase, although it receives all the streams and all the springs, is as follows: in part, because its own magnitude does not feel the inflowing streams; further, because the salty water consumes the fresh water flows; or because the clouds attract to themselves a large portion of the water; also partly because the winds sweep it up, or partly because the sun dries it up; finally, because after having percolated through some hidden openings of the earth and having beenreturnedtotheheadofthestreamsandtothesprings,itrunsback. Isidore’s writings rapidly spread all over Western Europe, and they had a huge impact. Bede (c. 673–735), a Benedictine monk at Jarrow in England, who lived some 100 years later, also wrote a book Nature, which seems to be strongly inspired by Isidore’s. His section 40 on why the sea does not increase (Beda, 1843) is an almost literal summary of Isidore’s descriptions quoted above. Isidore’s influence is also evident in the work of HrabanusMaurus(c.776–856)ofMainz.EntitledvariouslyOnNatureorOntheUniverse, it was written around 844, at the height of the Carolingian Renaissance. Intended as an aid for preparing sermons, the text is replete with biblical references and Christian allegories and Hrabanus comes across as a well-read author; however, for his explanation on why the sea does not increase and on the origin of streams and springs, his main source was clearly Isidore. His section on this topic (Rabanus Maurus, 1852; 11, 2) is taken nearly verbatim from Isidore’s (13, 14) quoted above. These few examples show how by the end of the first millennium of the present era a number of concepts of Greek natural philosophy had been propagated in Western Europe afterword through Isidore’s writings.

{"paragraph": "14.3.3 The High Middle Ages and the Renaissance Theseprevailingconceptsinnaturalphilosophyremainedroughlythesameuntilthebegin- ning of the thirteenth century, when Aristotle’s philosophical works began to draw greater attentioninWesternEurope.TheLatintranslationsoftheseworkswerederivedfromGreek originals, as a result of intensified contacts with Constantinople during the crusades, and from Arabic translations mostly in Moorish Spain (see Jourdain, 1960; Peters, 1968). In contrast to Western Europe, where his theories had somehow been overlooked until then, possibly as a result of the emphasis on Epicureanism and Stoicism among the Romans, in the Arab world Aristotle had been held in high esteem once his works had become available in translation. This is witnessed by the fact (cf. Mieli, 1966; pp 95, 102) that the famous philosophers Al-Farabi (d. 950) from Turkestan, and the Iranian Ibn-Sina (“Avi- after Aristotle. The history of Aristotle’s theories in the Arabic world, their subsequent acceptancebytheLatins,andtheireventualpenetrationintothevernacular,makeforsome fascinating reading. In the case of the Meteorologica, the first three books were translated early on from a partly abbreviated and corrupted Arabic version by Gerardus Cremonensis (d. 1187), and the fourth book, which does however not deal with meteorologic phenom- century later, around 1260, a more faithful version of the first three books was produced from the original Greek by Guillelmus de Morbeka (Willem van Moerbeke, c. 1215–1286) (Brams and Vanhamel, 1989). As a result, in the course of the thirteenth century, copies of these Latin translations started to appear in Western Europe, and gradually made their influence felt. Also, not long after the Latin translation by Willem, toward the end of the thirteenth century a Norman cleric, Mahieu le Vilain, made a translation of the Meteoro- into the French vernacular. An indication of the tremendous influence Aristotle’s works must have had, is the fact that for the period between 1200 and 1650 Lohr (1967– 1973) lists more than 85 commentaries on the Meteorologica, some of them by famous scholars like Alfred of Sareshel (1988), Albertus Magnus, Thomas de Aquino, Johannes centuriesandattheheightoftheRenaissanceEuropeanliteraturehadbecomefullyimbued with many of his physical theories. These theories served not merely as physical explana- tions, but they were also used as a rich source of metaphors and poetic imagery (Heninger, But while Aristotle’s ideas were ubiquitous and known by most scholars, they were far from universally accepted. The main effect of Aristotle’s Meteorologica, like his other works, it seems, was that it generated a common vocabulary, within a coherent system of logic, which stimulated more thorough discussion and the formulation of new questions, but not necessarily the answers, about the nature of the Universe. Thus, contrary to what is the latin era usually assumed about medieval scholarship, Aristotle’s theories were not always blindly accepted but they often provided the impetus for more correct interpretations. The writings isprobablybestknownforhisproverbialass(asinus)andalsoforthefactthat,inrebuttalto Aristotleandsome350yearsbeforeNewton,hehadsomeideaoftheprincipleofmomentum conservation.InhisbookQuestionsonthethreebooksofAristotle’sMeteorologica(Ducos, 1998, p. 82), Buridanus wrote the following. For it is also said to be possible that the water of the sea is evaporated and that the vapor is changed intoair,whichiscarriedbythewindtoadistantplace,anddescendstheretotheearthtoreplenishthe pores to avoid a vacuum, and is there condensed and changed into water, which comes to the spring andthenflowstothesea. In this passage he seems to admit that Aristotle’s mechanism of condensation inside the Earth may be possible, but then he continues in direct contradiction of Aristotle, pointing to the rain as the substantial source of the springs. The waters of springs come from the rains in this manner, because there are in the earth large hollow spaces which receive much rain water in winter, which for some hollow spaces suffices to flow out through the year until the winter rains return, and thus they are perpetual springs, which flow from these hollow spaces. There are other smaller hollow spaces which cannot receive in themselves so muchwater,whichwouldsufficetoflowoutthroughthewholeyear;therefore,thespringswhichflow fromthemdryupinsummer. Inotherwords,ifthecondensedwatercouldbeasubstantialsourceofspringwater,springs would not dry up in summer. This shows that among some influential scholars at the UniversityofParis,rainwastakenasthemain,ifperhapsnotthesole,agentinthegeneration of springs. Later examples, indicating that the rainfall percolation concept was not uncommon gave descriptions of the origin of springs and rivers that come generally quite close to the rainfall percolation mechanism as it is known today. It is worth noting that, just like Vitruvius, neither one was famous for his philosophical ideas; Palissy was known mostly forhispracticalandartistictalentsasaceramist,andBartas,asoldieranddiplomat,forhis poetry. Although both were Huguenots, their specific ideas on the origin of springs do not appear to be literal biblical accounts. But disagreement with Aristotle among some did not necessarily lead to improved concepts among others. For instance, Leonardo Da Vinci (1452–1519), in his notebooks (seeMacCurdy,1938,p.22)firstdescribeshowheatraiseswatervaportohigherelevations, where it condenses and falls as rain and hail; he then explains how in a similar way the same heat also draws up water from the roots of the mountains, through channels inside these mountains like through the veins inside the human body, to their summits, where the water can flow out through cracks and crevices to create rivers. He also concludes “. . . that the water passes from the rivers to the sea, and from the sea to the rivers, ever making the self-same round . . .” thus implying the seawater filtration mechanism to arrive back at the roots of the mountains. Another example is the description given by Descartes (1596– 1650)(1637,p.179),whichwasalsonearlythesameastheseawaterfiltrationtheoryofold. Hence, the fresh waters which flow into the sea, do not make it any larger because as many others leave it continuously.

By singling out and further specifying one of these theories, Perrault contributed to the evolution of hydrological thought, even if the theory he highlighted as the \"Common Opinion\" was not widely held among his peers."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, why did the \"Common Opinion\" believe that rains falling on the slope of hills were lost and of no use for springs?", "answer": "The \"Common Opinion\" believed that rains falling on the slope of hills were lost and of no use for springs because, from there, they fall into rivers which carry them to the sea. This perspective suggests a lack of understanding of groundwater recharge processes and the interconnectedness of surface and subsurface water systems. It implies a simplistic view of water movement, where water either directly contributes to springs by penetrating the earth or is lost to the sea via rivers, without considering the complexities of groundwater flow and its role in sustaining springs and rivers."}, {"question": "What implications does the \"Common Opinion\" have on our understanding of the relationship between springs, rivers, and rainfall percolation?", "answer": "The \"Common Opinion\" as described by Perrault implies a direct relationship between rainfall percolation and the formation of springs, which in turn are seen as the source of rivers. This view suggests that rainfall is a critical component in the hydrological cycle, contributing to both springs and, by extension, rivers. However, the fact that only a minority of experts held this view, while it was possibly more widely accepted among the general population, highlights the gap between scientific understanding and public perception of hydrological processes during the 17th century. It also underscores the importance of continued scientific inquiry to refine our understanding of these relationships."}, {"question": "How does Perrault's identification of the \"Common Opinion\" reflect the transition from philosophical to scientific understanding of hydrology?", "answer": "Perrault's identification of the \"Common Opinion\" and his detailed critique of prevailing theories mark a significant step in the transition from philosophical to scientific understanding of hydrology. By systematically reviewing and analyzing existing theories, Perrault laid the groundwork for a more empirical and evidence-based approach to understanding hydrological processes. The fact that he could describe the sequence of processes in a way that would not be out of place in modern descriptions suggests a growing recognition of the importance of observational evidence and logical reasoning in hydrology, paving the way for future scientific advancements."}, {"question": "In the context of historical hydrological thought, why is it significant that Perrault called the described theory the \"Common Opinion\" despite its limited support among experts?", "answer": "It is significant because it suggests that toward the end of the 17th century, there might have been a disconnect between the views held by expert natural philosophers and those of the general population. The labeling of this theory as the \"Common Opinion\" implies that it might have been widely accepted or intuitive to the layperson, even if not supported by the majority of experts. This discrepancy highlights the challenges in the dissemination and acceptance of scientific knowledge, where popular beliefs can lag behind or diverge from scientific understanding, and underscores the importance of public education and scientific communication."}, {"question": "What does the description of the \"Common Opinion\" reveal about the understanding of water cycles and hydrological processes during the 17th century?", "answer": "The description reveals a simplistic yet insightful understanding of the water cycle, recognizing the role of rainfall and snowmelt in replenishing groundwater, which in turn feeds springs and rivers. However, it also shows limitations in understanding the complexities of groundwater flow, the role of topography in water movement, and the interconnectedness of surface and subsurface water systems. The theory's focus on the direct contribution of rainfall to springs and its belief that rivers are formed"}]}
