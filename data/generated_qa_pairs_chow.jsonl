{"paragraph": "1.2 SYSTEMS CONCEPT Hydrologic phenomena are extremely complex, and may never be fully under- stood. However, in the absence of perfect knowledge, they may be represented in a simplified way by means of the systems concept. A system is a set of connected parts that form a whole. The hydrologic cycle may be treated as a system whose components are precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and other phases of the hydrologic cycle. These components can be grouped into subsystems of the overall cycle; to analyze the total system, the simpler subsystems can be treated separately and the results combined according to the interactions between the subsystems. In Fig. 1.2.1, the global hydrologic cycle is pebisogied as a ae ihe dashed lines avis it into three subsytems: the atmospheric q cor pee 6 APPLIED HYDROLOGY For most practical problems, only a few processes of the hydrologic cycle are considered at a time, and then only considering a small portion of the earth’s surface. A more restricted system definition than the global hydrologic system is appropriate for such treatment, and is developed from a concept of the control volume. In fluid mechanics, the application of the basic principles of mass, momentum, and energy to a fluid flow system is accomplished by using a control volume, a reference frame drawn in three dimensions through which the fluid Overland Runoff to flow streams and eet ocean INTRODUCTION 7 flows. The control volume provides the framework for applying the laws of conservation of mass and energy and Newton’s second law to obtain practical equations of motion. In developing these equations, it is not necessary to know the precise flow pattern inside the control volume. What must be known are the properties of the fluid flow at the control surface, the boundary of the control volume. The fluid inside the control volume is treated as a mass, which may be represented as being concentrated at one point in space when considerintgh e action of external forces such as gravity. By analogy, a hydrologic system is defined as a structure or volume in space, surrounded by a boundary, that accepts water and other inputs, operates on them internally, and produces them as outputs (Fig. 1.2.2). The structure (for surface or subsurface flow) or volume in space (for atmospheric moisture flow) is the totality of the flow paths through which the water may pass as throughput from the point it enters the system to the point it leaves. The boundary is a continuous surface defined in three dimensions enclosing the volume or structure. A working ‘medium enters the system as input, interacts with the structure and other media, and leaves as output. Physical, chemical, and biological processes operate on the working media within the system; the most common working media involved in hydrologic analysis are water, air, and heat energy. The procedure of developing working equations and models of hydrologic phenomena is similar to that in fluid mechanics. In hydrology, however, there is generally a greater degree of approximation in applying physical laws because the systems are larger and more complex, and may involve several working media. Also, most hydrologic systems are inherently random because their major input is precipitation, a highly variable and unpredictable phenomenon.

{"paragraph": "1.5 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROLOGY The science of hydrology began with the concept of the hydrologic cycle. From ancient times, many have speculated about the circulation of water, including the poet Homer (about 1000 B.c.), and philosophers Thales, Plato, and Aristotle in Greece; Lucretius, Seneca, and Pliny in Rome; and many medieval schol- ars. Much of this speculation was scientifically unsound; however, the Greek INTRODUCTION 13 ‘Space-time.domain Timet FrS ea hey |f e A, Fi TIT : 0 Distancex T(t) S ieee L Tt [tifoe i f pre ow ae bee, Distance x ‘(BY\"Deterrninistic lumped unsteady-flow.model, d/di =4t)~O4: I(t) Q(t) Time ¢ i Saag ie ae \\ ' At Aeel : e ar F Se 0 yt DNA 16 0— At le t Oizal Ax isi E AOyP AI enY Tnr ies aD SeT,, Ony 4 (Distance x Distance x V / 5 > ma be Lp) 1 ) i i nden - i PG“ | r»»e— oy is = pete 1 \\ (Ana ay ey Sena Ve t » Woreaue 4 Sh vA YP) SOE LI, bY A) ) Ga ra} aE sizeo ftS RT aE haere earn i ertical lines at x =O and.x =L , respectively...

He believed that the sun lifted water from the sea into the atmosphere, from which it fell as rain, and that rainwater was then collected in underground reservoirs, which fed the river flows. An improvement of this theory was made by another Greek philosopher, Theophrastus (c. 372-287 B.c.), who correctly described the hydrologic cycle in the atmosphere; he gave a sound explanation of the formation of precipitation by condensation and freezing. After studying the works of Theophrastus, the Roman architect and engineer Marcus Vitruvius, who lived about the time of Christ, conceived the theory that is now generally accepted: he extended Theophrastus’ explanation, claiming that groundwater was largely derived from rain and snow through infiltration from the ground surface. This may be considered a forerunner of the modern version of the hydrologic cycle. Independent thinking occurred in ancient Asian civilizations (UNESCO, 1974). The Chinese recorded observations of rain, sleet, snow, and wind on An- yang oracle bones as early as 1200 B.c. They probably used rain gages around 1000 B.c., and established systematic rain gaging about 200 B.c. In India, the first quantitative measurements of rainfall date back to the latter part of the fourth century B.c. The concept of a dynamic hydrologic cycle may have arisen in China by 900 B.c.,! in India by 400 B.c.,? and in Persia by the tenth century, *b ut these ideas had little impact on Western thought. During the Renaissance, a gradual change occurred from purely philosoph- ical concepts of hydrology toward observational science. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made the first systematic studies of velocity distribution in streams, using a weighted rod held afloat by an inflated animal»bladder. The rod would be released at a point in the stream, and Leonardo would walk along the bank marking its progress with an (Fig. 1.5.1) and judging the difference between the surface and bottom velocities by the angle of the rod. By releasing the rod at different points in the stream’s cross section, Leonardo traced the ' In the volume “Minor Folksongs” of the “Book of Odes” (anonymous, 900-500 B.C.) is written: ‘Rain and snow are interchangeable and becoming sleet through first (fast) condensation.” Also, Fan Li (400 B.C., Chi Ni tzu or “The Book of Master Chi Ni”) said: “...the wind (containing moisture) is ch’i (moving force or energy) in the sky, and the rain is ch’i of the ground. Wind blows according to the time of the year and rain falls due to the wind (by condensation). We can say that the ch’i in the sky moves downwards (by precipitation) while the ch’i of the ground moves upwards (through evaporation).” 2 Upanisads, dating from as early as 400 B.C. (Micropaedia, Vol. X, The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, p. 283, 1974), translated from Sanskrit to English by Swami Prabhavananda and Frederick Manchester, Mentor Books, No. MQ921, p. 69. In this work is written: “The rivers in the east flow eastwards, the rivers in the west flow westward, and all enter into the sea. From sea to sea they pass, the clouds lifting them to the sky as vapor and sending them down as rain.” 3 Karaji, M., “Extraction of Hidden Water”, ca. 1016 A.D., translated from Arabic to Persian by H. Khadiv-Djam, Iranian Culture Foundation, Tehran, Iran. In this work is written: “Springs come from waters hidden inside the earth while waters on the ground surface from rains and snows ... and rain and snowmelt percolate the earth while only excess waters run off into the sea...” INTRODUCTION 15 Bladder Brick (a) (b) FIGURE 1.5.1 Leonardo da Vinci measured the velocity distribution across a stream section by repeated experiments of the type shown in (a).

(Source: Frazier, 1974, Figs. 6 and 7. Used with permission.) velocity distribution across the channel. According to Frazier (1974), the 8000 existing pages of Leonardo’s notes contain more entries concerning hydraulics than about any other subject. Concerning the velocity distribution in streams, he wrote, “Of water of uniform weight, depth, breadth and declivity [slope], that portion is swifter which is nearest to the surface; and this occurs because the water that is uppermost is contiguous to the air, which offers but little resistance through its being lighter than water; the water that is below is contiguous to the earth, which offers great resistance through being immovable and heavier than water” (MacCurdy, 1939). Prior to Leonardo, it was thought that water flowed more rapidly at the bottom of a stream, because if two holes were pierced in a wall holding back a body of water, the flow from the lower hole was more rapid than the flow from the upper one. The French Huguenot scientist Bernard Palissy (1510-1589) showed that rivers and springs originate from rainfall, thus refuting an age-old theory that streams were supplied directly by the sea. The French naturalist Pierre Perrault (1608-1680) measured runoff and found it to be only a fraction of rainfall. 16 APPLIED HYDROLOGY He recognized that rainfall is a source for runoff and correctly concluded that: the remainder of the precipitation. was..lost»by.-transpiration, “evaporation,«and diversion.

Like many sciences, hydrology was recognized only recently as a separate discipline. About 1965, the United States Civil Service Commission recognized hydrologist as a job classification. The “hydrology series” of positions in the Commission list of occupations was described as follows: This series includes professional scientific positions that have as their objective the study of the interrelationship and reaction between water and its environment in the hydrologic cycle. These positions have the functions of investigation, analysis, and interpretation of the phenomena of occurrence, circulation, distribution, and quality of water in the Earth’s atmosphere, on the Earth’s surface, and in the soil and rock strata. Such work requires the application of basic principles drawn from and supplemented by fields such as meteorology, geology, soil science, plant physiology, hydraulics, and higher mathematics. The advent of the computer revolutionized hydrology and made hydrologic anal- ysis possible on a larger scale. Complex theories describing hydrologic processes are now applied using computer simulations, and vast quantities of observed data are reduced to summary statistics for better understanding of hydrologic phenom- ena and for establishing hydrologic design levels. More recently, developments in electronics and data transmission have made possible instantaneous data retrieval from remote recorders and the development of “real-time” programs for forecast- ing floods and other water operations. Microcomputers and spreadsheet programs INTRODUCTION 17 now provide many hydrologists with new computational convenience and power. The evolution of hydrologic knowledge and methods brings about continual improvement in the scope and accuracy of solutions to hydrologic problems. Hydrologic problems directly affect the life and activities of large numbers of people. An element of risk is always present — a more extreme event than any historically known can occur at any time. A corresponding responsibility rests upon the hydrologist to provide the best analysis that knowledge and data will permit.

{"paragraph": "2.1 REYNOLDS TRANSPORT THEOREM The Reynolds transport theorem takes physical laws that are normally applied to a discrete mass of a substance and applies them instead to a fluid flowing continuously through a control volume. For this purpose, two types of fluid ies can be distinguished: pro mn Neate onto fT aiss preseanndt ,intensive properties, which are independent of. mass. For any extensive property B, a corresponding intensive property 8 can be defined as the quantity of B per unit mass of fluid, that is 8B= dB/dm. B and B can be scalar or vector quantities depending on the property being considered. The Reynolds transport theorem relates the time rate of change of an extensive property in the fluid, dB/dt, to the external causes producing this 20 HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES 21 change. Consider fluid momentum; in this case, B = mV and B = d(mV)/dm = V, the fluid velocity, where bold face type indicates a vector quantity. By Newton’s second law, the time rate of change of momentum is equal to the net applied force on the fluid: dB/dt = d(mV)/dt = =F. i i the m When Newton’s second law or other physical laws are applied to a solid body, the focus is on the motion of the body and the analysis Feilcuisalselbiody AROMAS.

The theorem separates the action of external influences o ssed by dB/dt, into two components: the time rate of change of the extensive property stored within the control volume, and the net outflow of the extensive property across the control surface. t (White, 1979; Shames, 1982; Fox and MacDonald, 1985; and Roberson and Crowe, 1985). Although it has not been widely used in hydrology up to this time it provides a consistent means for applying physical laws to hydrologic systems. To derive the governing equation of the theorem, consider the control volume shown in Fig. 2.1.1, whose boundary is defined by the dashed control surface. Within the control volume there is a shaded element of volume dV. If the density of the fluid is p, the mass of fluid in the element is dm = pdV, the amount of extensive property B contained in the fluid element is dB = Bdm = BpdV, and the total amount of extensive property within any volume is the integral of these elemental amounts over that volume: B= || {s oav (2.1.1) where JJ indicates integration over a volume. Fluid flows from left to right through the control volume in Fig. 2.1.1, but no fluid passes through the upper or lower boundary. After a small interval of time At, the fluid mass inside the control volume at time ¢ has moved to the right and occupies the space delineated by dotted lines. Three regions of space can then be identified: region I, to the left, which the fluid mass occupies at time ¢ but not at ¢ + Afr; region II, in the center, filled by the fluid mass at both points in time; and region III, on the right, outside the control volume, which the fluid mass occupies at ¢ + Ar but not at t.

If the control volume is fixed in space and time, the total derivative can be replaced by the partial derivative 0/dt because the focus is on the time rate of change of the extensive property stored in the control volume without regard for its internal spatial distribution. The second term in Eq. (2.1.3), involving B; and By, represents the flow of the extensive property across the control surface. Figure 2.1.1(c) shows a close- up view of region m1 at the outlet from the control volume. An element of area in the outlet control surface is labeled dA, and the element of volume dV is the volume of the tube containing all the fluid passing through dA in time At. The length of the tube is A/ = VAr, the length of the flow path in time At. The volume of the tube is dv = Alcos @dA where @ is the angle between the velocity vector V and the direction normal to the area element dA. The amount of extensive property B in the tube is BepdV = BpAlcos 6dA. The total amount of fluid in region 1 is found by integrating these elemental amounts over the entire outlet control surface. Thus the term in By, in (2.1.3) can be written as ; |[ !oa1cos 04a (BB =nimetssaerciata m Dabs lim ay wea} oe At ( ) where the double integral JJ indicates that the integral is over a surface. As At approaches 0, the limit of the ratio A//At is the magnitude of the fluid velocity V. Let the normal area vector dA be defined as a vector of magnitude dA with direction normal to the area dA pointing outward from the control surface; then the term Vcos 6dA can be expressed as the vector dot product V-dA.

Consequently, V-dA is always negative for inflow. For fluid leaving the control volume cos @ is positive, so V-dA is always positive for outflow. At the impermeable boundaries, V and dA are perpendicular and therefore V-dA = 0.

Initially, when precipitation rates are high, storage increases. As streamflow rates increase and eventually exceed precipitation rates, storage decreases. This balance is essential for understanding the watershed's response to precipitation events and for predicting future hydrologic behavior. The calculations provide a detailed insight into the dynamics of the flood event, highlighting the importance of considering both precipitation input and streamflow output in assessing watershed storage and runoff response."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, what implications does the representation of continuous time functions on a discrete time domain have for the accuracy and reliability of model predictions?", "answer": "The representation of continuous time functions on a discrete time domain can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of hydrologic model predictions. The choice between sampled data systems and pulse data systems, for instance, can affect how well the model captures the nuances of hydrologic processes, such as the timing and magnitude of peak flows. Furthermore, the discretization of time can introduce errors, especially if the time intervals are too large to adequately capture the variability of the hydrologic processes being modeled. Therefore, careful consideration of the discrete time representation is crucial for ensuring that hydrologic models provide accurate and reliable predictions, which are essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and other applications. The implications of discrete time representation highlight the need for a thorough understanding of hydrologic processes and the limitations of modeling approaches to make informed decisions in water resources management."}, {"question": "How does the concept of discrete time continuity apply to the analysis of flood events, such as the one described on Shoal Creek?", "answer": "The concept of discrete time continuity is fundamental to the analysis of flood events because it allows for the quantification of the hydrologic balance during the event. By dividing the time horizon into discrete intervals, it becomes possible to calculate the inflows, outflows, and changes in storage over time, providing a detailed picture of how the watershed responds to precipitation. This analysis is critical for understanding the dynamics of flood events, including the timing"}]}

HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES 39 The Moody diagram given here for open channel flow has some limitations. First, it accounts for resistance due to friction elements randomly distributed on the channel wall, but it does not account for form drag associated with nonuniformities in the channel. Emmett (1978) found that the friction factor for thin sheet flows on soil or grass surfaces could be as much as a factor of 10 greater than the value for friction drag alone. Also, the Moody diagram is valid only for fixed bed channels, not for erodable ones. The shape of the cross section (rectangular, triangular, circular, etc.) has some influence on the friction factor but the effect is not large.

The relative roughness can significantly affect the friction factor, especially in channels with high roughness values, leading to increased energy losses and reduced flow rates."}, {"question": "In the context of fully turbulent flow, how does the friction factor relate to the relative roughness?", "answer": "For fully turbulent flow, the friction factor is a function of the relative roughness alone, and it can be calculated using the equation f = —2log10(3.7D/k), where D is the pipe diameter and k is the size of sand grains. This relationship allows for the determination of the friction factor without needing to consider the Reynolds number, simplifying the calculation of flow characteristics in fully turbulent conditions."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of the Moody diagram for open channel flow, and why are they significant?", "answer": "The Moody diagram has limitations as it only accounts for resistance due to friction elements randomly distributed on the channel wall and does not account for form drag associated with nonuniformities in the channel. This limitation is significant because it can lead to underestimation of the friction factor, especially in channels with significant form drag, such as those with vegetation or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the diagram is valid only for fixed bed channels, not for erodible ones, which restricts its applicability to certain types of channels. These limitations highlight the need for careful consideration of channel characteristics when applying the Moody diagram to ensure accurate flow predictions."}, {"question": "How does the shape of the cross-section influence the friction factor in open channel flow?", "answer": "The shape of the cross-section has some influence on the friction factor, but the effect is not large. This means that while the exact shape of the channel (e.g., rectangular, triangular, circular) can affect flow resistance, it is not a dominant factor compared to other characteristics like roughness and velocity. However, understanding the impact of cross-sectional shape is important for precise calculations, especially in channels where the shape may vary significantly along the flow path."}, {"question": "In the context of calculating flow velocity using Manning's equation, what is the role of the hydraulic radius?", "answer": "The hydraulic radius (R) is a critical parameter in Manning's equation, as it represents the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the flow to the wetted perimeter. It is used to calculate the flow velocity, along with the slope of the channel (S), the Manning roughness coefficient (n), and the depth of the flow. The hydraulic radius effectively accounts for the geometry of the channel and how it influences the flow, making it a fundamental component of the equation."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to verify that the flow is fully turbulent when applying Manning's equation?", "answer": "Verifying that the flow is fully turbulent is essential because Manning's equation is applicable under this condition. Fully turbulent flow ensures that the equation's assumptions about the flow regime are met, providing accurate estimates of flow velocity. If the flow is not fully turbulent, the equation may not accurately capture the flow characteristics, leading to potential errors in flow rate calculations and other hydrological assessments. The criterion for fully turbulent flow, given by n^2/RS^7, must be greater than a specific threshold to ensure the applicability of Manning's equation."}, {"question": "How does the Manning roughness coefficient (n) relate to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) in open channel flow?", "answer": "The Manning roughness coefficient (n) can be expressed in terms of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) using the relationship n = (R^2/3) * (f/8g)^0.5, where R is the hydraulic radius and g is the acceleration due to gravity. This relationship allows for the conversion between the two coefficients, facilitating the use of either Manning's equation or the Darcy-Weisbach equation for flow calculations, depending on the available data"}]}

By differentiating this equation, the velocity gradient can be found, and subsequently, the shear stress and momentum flux can be calculated."}, {"question": "Why is the albedo of a surface important in the context of radiation processes in hydrology?", "answer": "The albedo of a surface is important because it measures the proportion of incoming radiation that is reflected back into the atmosphere, which affects the net radiation received at the earth's surface. This, in turn, influences the energy balance and hydrologic processes such as evaporation and runoff. The albedo varies depending on the type of surface and its properties, making it a critical factor in understanding and modeling hydrologic systems."}, {"question": "In the context of conduction and convection processes, how do the fluxes of mass, momentum, and energy relate to each other?", "answer": "The fluxes of mass, momentum, and energy in conduction and convection processes are related through the proportionality constants, such as the diffusion coefficient for mass conduction and the heat conductivity for heat energy transport. These constants determine the rate at which these quantities are transferred. In convection, the fluxes are also influenced by the velocity of the fluid, which affects the transport of mass, momentum, and energy. Understanding these relationships is essential for analyzing and modeling hydrologic systems, where the transfer of these quantities plays a critical role."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in the context of radiation processes in hydrology?", "answer": "The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is significant because it is used in the equation for the emission of radiation by a body, which is crucial for understanding the radiation balance at the earth's surface. This constant, along with the emissivity of the surface and its temperature, determines the rate at which the surface emits radiation, which in turn affects the net radiation and the energy balance of the hydrologic system."}, {"question": "How does human activity influence the radiation balance in the atmosphere, and what are the implications for hydrologic processes?", "answer": "Human activity, particularly the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, influences the radiation balance by trapping some of the radiation emitted by the earth, leading to an increase in the earth's temperature. This phenomenon, known as global warming, has significant implications for hydrologic processes, including changes in precipitation patterns, evaporation rates, and runoff regimes. Understanding these impacts is crucial for managing water resources and predicting future hydrologic conditions. The precise magnitude of the earth's warming by this mechanism is not yet fully known, highlighting the need for continued research into the effects of human activity on the radiation balance and hydrologic processes."}, {"question": "In the context of turbulent flow, why is the concept of shear stress important for understanding momentum transfer?", "answer": "The concept of shear stress is important in turbulent flow because it represents the force per unit area that causes the fluid to deform, leading to the transfer of momentum. Shear stress is a critical factor in determining the velocity gradient and the momentum flux in turbulent flows, which are characteristic of many hydrologic systems, including rivers and atmospheric flows over land surfaces. Understanding shear stress and its role in momentum transfer is essential for analyzing and predicting the behavior of these systems."}, {"question": "How do the laws of conduction and convection for mass, momentum, and energy transport compare in terms of their mathematical form and underlying principles?", "answer": "The laws of conduction and convection for mass, momentum, and energy transport share similarities in their mathematical form, with each involving a proportionality constant and a potential gradient. However, they differ in their underlying principles, with conduction relying on molecular interactions and convection involving the bulk movement of fluids. Despite these differences, the equations describing these processes can be written in analogous forms, facilitating the comparison and analysis of different transport mechanisms in hydrologic systems. This comparison is useful for understanding the relative importance of conduction and convection in various contexts and for developing models that accurately represent these processes."}, {"question": "What is the role of the diffusion coefficient in the context of mass conduction in hydrologic processes?", "answer": "The"}]}

If the flow is fully turbulent, Manning's equation provides a straightforward method for calculating velocity and flow rate based on channel characteristics like slope, depth, and roughness. However, if the flow does not meet the criterion for fully turbulent flow, alternative methods such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the Moody diagram must be used, which can lead to different results and require additional considerations like kinematic viscosity."}, {"question": "In the context of uniform flow in a circular conduit, how is the wall shear stress calculated, and what are its implications?", "answer": "The wall shear stress in a circular conduit is calculated using the formula τ = γh_f / L, where τ is the wall shear stress, γ is the specific weight of the fluid, h_f is the head loss over a length L of the conduit.

The wall shear stress has significant implications for the design and operation of pipelines, as it affects the conduit's durability and the energy required to maintain flow."}, {"question": "Why is it important to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow in hydrological applications?", "answer": "Distinguishing between laminar and turbulent flow is important in hydrological applications because these flow regimes have different characteristics that affect how water moves through channels and conduits. Laminar flow is smooth and orderly, while turbulent flow is chaotic and mixes the fluid. This distinction is critical for accurately modeling flow rates, velocities, and the transport of substances in water, as different equations and assumptions apply to each flow regime. Incorrectly assuming the type of flow can lead to significant errors in hydrological predictions and designs."}, {"question": "In the context of the given problems, how does the choice of flow depth affect the calculation of velocity and flow rate?", "answer": "The choice of flow depth significantly affects the calculation of velocity and flow rate, as it influences whether the flow meets the criterion for fully turbulent flow. Shallower flows are more likely to be in the transitional or laminar regime, requiring the use of more complex equations like the Darcy-Weisbach equation. In contrast, deeper flows are typically fully turbulent, allowing for the simpler application of Manning's equation. The flow depth also directly impacts the flow rate, with deeper flows generally resulting in higher velocities and flow rates due to the increased hydraulic radius and reduced frictional losses."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not satisfying the criterion for fully turbulent flow in open channel flow calculations?", "answer": "Not satisfying the criterion for fully turbulent flow in open channel flow calculations implies that the flow is either laminar or in a transitional state.

This is calle . 53 54 aPpPLIED HYDROLOGY FIGURE 3.1.1 One-cell atmospheric circulation pattern for a nonrotating planet. The rotation of the earth from west to east changes the circulation pattern. As aring of air about the earth’s axis moves toward the poles, its radius decreases. In order to maintain angular momentum, the velocity of air increases with respect to the land surface, thus producing a westerly air flow. The converse is true for a ring of air moving toward the equator—it forms an easterly air flow. The effect producing these changes in wind direction and velocity is known as the Coriolis force. The actual pattern of atmospheric circulation has three cells in each hemi- sphere, as shown in Fig. 3.1.2. In the tropical cell, heated air ascends at the equa- tor, proceeds toward the poles at upper levels, loses heat and descends toward the ground at latitude 30°. Near the ground, it branches, one branch moving toward the equator and the other toward the pole. In the polar cell, air rises at 60° and flows toward the poles at upper levels, then cools and flows back to 60° near the earth’s surface. The middle cell is driven frictionally by the other two; its surface air flows toward the pole, producing prevailing westerly air flow in the mid-latitudes. The uneven distribution of ocean and land on the earth’s surface, coupled. with their different thermal properties, creates additional spatial variation in atmo- spheric circulation. The annual shifting of the thermal equator due to the earth’s revolution around the sun causes a corresponding oscillation of the three-cell circulation pattern. With a larger oscillation, exchanges of air between adjacent cells can be more frequent and complete, possibly resulting in many flood years. Also, monsoons may advance deeper into such countries as India and Australia. With a smaller oscillation, intense high pressure may build up around 30° lati- tude, thus creating extended dry periods. Since the atmospheric circulation is very complicated, only the general pattern can be identified. The atmosphere is divided vertically into various zones. The atmospheric circulation described above occurs in the troposphere, which ranges in height from about 8 km at the poles to 16 km at the equator.

For dry air the rate of decrease is called the dry adiabatic lapse rate and is approximately 9.8°C/km (Brutsaert,1982). The saturated adiabatic lapse rate is less, about 6.5°C/km, because some of the vapor in the air condenses as it rises and cools, releasing heat into the surrounding air. These are average figures for lapse rates that can vary considerably with altitude. The tropopause separates the troposphere from the stratosphere above.

Despite its small quantity, water vapor plays a vital role in the hydrologic cycle. This is because vapor transport in air through a hydrologic system can be described by the Reynolds transport theorem, allowing for the calculation of the mass of water vapor per unit mass of moist air, known as the specific humidity. This process is crucial for understanding the movement and transformation of water within the Earth's system."}, {"question": "In the process of precipitation formation, why are aerosols important, and how do they influence the growth of water droplets in clouds?", "answer": "Aerosols are important in the process of precipitation formation because they serve as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor. The tiny droplets that form on these aerosols grow by condensation and impact with other droplets as they are carried by turbulence in the cloud. This process continues until the droplets become large enough to fall through the cloud base as precipitation. The size of aerosols, which can range from 10^-8 to 10^-5 meters, is significant because it affects the rate of condensation and the ultimate size of the precipitation droplets."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the gas constants for moist air and dry air, and how does this relationship impact the calculation of air density?", "answer": "The relationship between the gas constants for moist air and dry air is given by R, = R,/(1 + 0.608q,), where R, is the gas constant for moist air, R, is the gas constant for dry air, and q, is the specific humidity. This relationship is important because it allows for the calculation of air density using the ideal gas law. The gas constant for moist air increases with specific humidity, but even for high temperatures, the difference between the gas constants for moist and dry air is less than 1 percent. This means that for many calculations, the gas constant for dry air can be used as an approximation."}, {"question": "How does the terminal velocity of a falling raindrop relate to its diameter, and what factors influence this relationship?", "answer": "The terminal velocity of a falling raindrop is related to its diameter through the balance of weight, buoyancy, and drag forces acting on the drop. For small drops, the drag force is proportional to the drop's velocity, while for larger drops, the drag force becomes proportional to the square of the velocity. The terminal velocity increases with drop size up to a plateau level of about 5 mm in diameter, beyond which the drops become flattened and the terminal velocity increases more slowly. Factors such as air density and viscosity influence this relationship, with higher air densities and viscosities resulting in lower terminal velocities."}, {"question": "In the context of a thunderstorm cell, what drives the convective circulation, and how does this circulation lead to precipitation?", "answer": "The convective circulation in a thunderstorm cell is driven by the heat energy released by the condensing moisture in the uplift region. As warm, moist air rises, it cools, and the water vapor condenses, releasing heat and creating an area of low pressure near the ground. This low pressure draws in more warm, moist air, which rises, cools, and condenses, releasing more heat and creating a self-sustaining cycle. This circulation leads to precipitation as the water droplets in the cloud grow large enough to fall through the cloud base. The precipitation intensity can be calculated using the equation derived from the continuity equation for water vapor transport, which takes into account the mass flow rate of water leaving the cell and the area over which the precipitation falls."}, {"question": "Why does precipitation vary spatially and temporally, and what factors contribute to this variability?", "answer": "Precipitation varies spatially and temporally due to the general pattern of atmospheric circulation and local factors such as orographic effects, seasonal changes in moisture inflow, and the movement of weather systems. In mountainous regions, orographic lift can enhance precipitation, while in coastal areas, the proximity to large bodies of water can increase moisture availability and lead to higher precipitation amounts. Seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation patterns can also lead to variations in precipitation, with some regions experiencing pronounced wet and dry seasons. Additionally, the movement of weather systems such as fronts and low-pressure systems can bring precipitation to an area, leading"}]}

To develop the continuity and energy equations applicable for evaporation, con- sider evaporation from an evaporation pan as shown in Fig. 3.5.1. An evapora- on pan is a circular tank containing water, in. which the rate of evaporation is measured by..the rate-of fall-of the water surface. A control surface is drawn around the pan enclosing both the water in the pan and the air above it. (Conn tinuity. Because the control VOUTTIE” ‘contains water in both the liquid and vapor phases, the integral must be written separately for the two phases. For the liquid phase, the extensive property is B = mass of liquid water; B = 1, p = Py (the density of water), and dB/dt = —m,, which is the mass flow rate of evaporation . The continuity equation for the liquid phase is —m, = 4{ {| pav+ || o wv-aa (3.5.1) CVn C.S. The pan has impermeable sides, so there is no flow of liquid water across the control surface and Jfp,,V-dA = 0. The rate of change of storage within the 82 APPLIED HYDROLOGY system is. given by (d/dt) SSJp,dV= pA dh/dt, where A-is the cross-sectional . area of the pan and h is the depth of water in it. Substituting into (3.5.1): dh = PwA hh; or My = Py AE (3.5.2) where £ = —dh/dt is the evaporation rate.

Thus, after substituting for my from (3.5.2), (3.5.3) becomes py yAE = |[ oov-aa (3.5.4) c.S. which is the continuity equation for an evaporation pan, considering both water and water vapor. In a more general sense, (3.5.4) can be used to define the evaporation or evapotranspiration rate from any surface when written in the form i me { qupaV-dA (3.5.5) where E is the equivalent depth of water evaporated per unit time (in/day or mm/day).

Because V= 0 for the water in the evaporation pan, and the rate of change of its elevation, z, is very small, (3.5.6) can be simplified to “ =a) {yZei ta sole Censizenan, a unit area_of water surface,. oe oheneien net radiation -flux Measured: in.watts per meter squared; the water supplies a sensible heat flux Asa the air stream and a ground heat flux G to the ground surface, so'dH/dt= R, — Hs — G.

For operational application where such apparatus is not available and mea- surements of g, and u are made at only one height in a standard climate sta- tion, Eq.

If the two levels 1 and 2 are taken at the evaporative surface and in the overlying air stream, respectively, it can be shown that the evaporation rate E, computed from the rate of net radiation [as given by Eq. (3.5.10)] and the evaporation rate computed from aerodynamic methods [Eq.

Equation (3.5.26) is the basic equation for the combination method of computing evaporation, which was first developed by Penman (1948). Its derivation is lengthy (see Wiesner, 1970), and will not be presented here. The combination method of calculating evaporation from meteorological data is the most accurate method when all the required data are available and the assumptions are satisfied. The chief oe - ie a balance are that steady state energy flov changes ii t storage over time in the water body are nsoitg nificant. This pe acier aaeedies application of the method to. daily.time intervals.or longer, and-to situations not involving large heat storage capacity, such as-a large lake possesses. The chief assumption. of the aerodynamic method is associated with the form of the vapor transfer coefficient B in Eq. (3.5.17).

This method is particularly useful when measurements of wind speed and humidity are available."}, {"question": "In the context of evapotranspiration, what is the significance of the crop coefficient, and how does it vary over the growth stages of a crop?", "answer": "The crop coefficient is a measure of the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to reference crop evapotranspiration. It varies over the growth stages of a crop, typically increasing as the crop grows and reaches full cover, then decreasing as the crop matures. For example, the crop coefficient for corn increases from 0.38 during the initial stage to 1.00 at full cover, and then decreases to 0.55 during the late season stage."}, {"question": "How does the combination method for calculating evaporation rates account for both energy balance and aerodynamic factors?", "answer": "The combination method combines the energy balance equation, which relates evaporation to net radiation, with the aerodynamic method, which accounts for the transport of water vapor away from the surface. This approach provides a more comprehensive estimate of evaporation rates by considering both the energy available for evaporation and the ability of the air to transport water vapor away from the surface."}, {"question": "In the context of atmospheric water, what is the role of the Bowen ratio in estimating evaporation rates, and how is it related to the sensible and latent heat fluxes?", "answer": "The Bowen ratio is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux, and it is used to estimate evaporation rates by relating the energy balance equation to the aerodynamic method. The Bowen ratio is calculated by coupling the transport equations for vapor and heat, and it is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, and wind speed."}, {"question": "Why is the Priestley-Taylor method a useful simplification of the combination method for estimating evaporation rates over large areas?", "answer": "The Priestley-Taylor method is a useful simplification because it assumes that the second term of the combination equation is approximately 30 percent of the first term, allowing for a simpler calculation of evaporation rates. This method is particularly useful for estimating evaporation rates over large areas, where the energy balance and aerodynamic factors are averaged over a larger spatial scale."}, {"question": "In the context of evapotranspiration, how do the reference crop evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient relate to the actual evapotranspiration of a specific crop?", "answer": "The reference crop evapotranspiration is a measure of the evapotranspiration rate of a standard crop, such as grass, under well-watered conditions. The crop coefficient is a measure of the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to reference crop evapotranspiration, and it is used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of a specific crop. The actual evapotranspiration is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the combination method versus the aerodynamic method for estimating evaporation rates, in terms of data requirements and accuracy?", "answer": "The combination method requires more data, including net radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, but it provides a more comprehensive estimate of evaporation rates by considering both energy balance and aerodynamic factors. The aerodynamic method, on the other hand, requires fewer data but may be less accurate, particularly in situations where energy balance is a limiting factor. The choice of method depends on the availability of data and the specific application."}, {"question": "In the context of rainfall measurement, what is the significance of the isohyetal map, and how is it used to estimate areal average rainfall?", "answer": "An isohyetal map is a map that shows the spatial distribution of rainfall depths, with lines connecting points of equal rainfall depth. The isohyetal map is used to estimate areal average rainfall by dividing the area into smaller regions, each with a uniform rainfall depth, and then calculating the weighted average of these depths. This method provides a more accurate estimate of areal average rainfall than the arithmetic-mean method, particularly in areas with complex terrain or heterogeneous rainfall patterns."}]}

However, in the context of the Thiessen method, it typically involves creating polygons (Thiessen polygons) around each rain gage, where the boundaries of these polygons are equidistant from the gages they separate, effectively dividing the area into regions, each representing the area closest to a particular gage. This method is used to estimate the average rainfall over an area by weighting the rainfall at each gage by the area of its corresponding Thiessen polygon."}, {"question": "How does the isohyetal method involve the concept of a ridge running southwest to northeast through a specific point?", "answer": "The isohyetal method involves drawing isohyets, which are lines of equal rainfall, and in this scenario, it is hinted that the maximum rainfall occurs on a ridge running southwest to northeast through the point (—3,—3).

This is because the new location of the gage could alter the areas represented by each gage in the Thiessen method or change the pattern of isohyets in the isohyetal method, potentially leading to different estimates of average rainfall.

This assumption simplifies the calculation of the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration but may not be accurate in situations where the depth of ponded water is significant.

{"paragraph": "4.4 PONDING TIME In the preceding sections several methods for computing the rate of infiltration into the soil were presented. All of these methods used the assumption that water is ponded to a small depth on the soil surface so all the water the soil can infiltrate is available at the surface. However, during a rainfall, water will pond on the surface only if the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity of the soil. The ponding time t, is the elapsed time between the time rainfall begins and the time water begins to pond on the soil surface. If rainfall begins on dry soil, the vertical moisture profile in the soil may appear as in Fig. 4.4.1. Prior to the ponding time (t < fp), the rainfall intensity is less than the potential infiltration rate and the soil surface is unsaturated. Ponding begins when the rainfall intensity exceeds the potential infiltration rate. At this time (t = ftp), the soil surface is saturated. As rainfall continues (t > t,), the saturated.zone extends deeper into the soil and overland flow occurs from the ponded water. How can the infiltration equations developed previously be used to describe this situation? 118 ApPLIED HYDROLOGY 0 Saturated Soil moisture content Depth FIGURE 4.4.1 in soil Soil moisture profiles before, during, and after ponding occurs. Mein and Larson (1973) presented a method for determining the ponding time with infiltration into the soil described by the Green-Ampt equation for rainfall of intensity i starting instantaneously and continuing indefinitely. There are three principles involved: (1) prior to the time ponding occurs, all the rainfall is infiltrated; (2) the potential infiltration rate f is a function of the cumuiative infiltration F; and (3) ponding occurs when the potential infiltration rate is less than or equal to the rainfall intensity. In the Green-Ampt equation, the infiltration rate f and cumulative infiltration F are related by A - f= “Eos si 1 (4.4.1) where K is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, wis the wetting front capillary pressure head, and A@ is the difference between the initial and final moisture contents of the soil. As shown in Fig. 4.4.2, the cumulative infiltration at the ponding time f, is given by F, = it, and the infiltration rate by f = i; substituting into Eq. (4.4.1), i= katy ae | itp solving, (4.4.2) _ KwAe Pid = gives the ponding time under constant rainfall intensity using the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. - Example 4.4.1.

To obtain the actual infiltration rate after ponding, a curve of potential infil- tration is constructed beginning at a time fo such that the cumulative infiltration and the infiltration rate at t, are equal to those observed under rainfall beginning at time 0 (see dashed line in Fig. 4.4.2).

Solution. From Example 4.3.1, ~A@ = 5.68 cm and K = 0.65 cm/h for this soil, and from Example 4.4.1, t, = 0.17 h and F, = 0.85 cm under rainfall intensity 5 cm/h.

The solution converges to F = 3.02 cm. The corresponding rate is given by (4.3.7): poate oy 5.68 =0.6 ae \" ARG = 1.87 cm/h These results may be compared with the cumulative infiltration of 3.17 cm obtained in Example 4.3.1 for infiltration under continuous ponding. Less water is infiltrated after one hour under the 5. cm/h rainfall because it took 10 minutes for ponding to occur, and the infiltration rate during this period was less than its potential value. tities for constant rainfall intensity; a set of equations is given for each of three approaches, based respectively on the Green-Ampt, Horton, and Philip infiltration equations. Equations (1) and (2) are the methods for computing infiltration under ponded conditions. Equation (3) gives the ponding time under constant rainfall intensity, and Equation (4) gives the equivalent time origin t,, from which the same infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration as those observed at ponding time would be produced under continuously ponded conditions. After ponding has occurred, the infiltration functions can be found for Horton’s and Philip’s equations by substituting ¢ — fo into Eqs. (1) and (2). For the Green-Ampt equa- tion, the method illustrated’ in Ex. 4.4.2 can be used. In Eq. (4.4.2) under the Green-Ampt method, ponding time f, is positive and finite only if i > K; pond- ing will never occur if the rainfall intensity is less than or equal to the hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Table 4.4.1 indicates that the same condition holds for Philip’s equation, while Horton’s equation requires i > f, to achieve ponding. If, in the Horton cquation, i > fo, ponding will occur immediately and t, = 0. The condition i < K holds for most rainfalls on very permeable soils and for light rainfall on less permeable soils. In such cases, streamflow results from subsurface flow, especially from areas near the stream channel. Determination of ponding times under rainfall of variable intensity can be done by an approach similar to that for constant intensity. Cumulative infiltration is calculated from rainfall as a function of time. A potential infiltration rate can be calculated from the cumulative infiltration using the Green-Ampt or other infiltration formulas. Whenever rainfall intensity is greater than the potential infiltration rate, ponding is occurring (Bouwer, 1978; Morel-Seytoux, 1981). For sites where estimates of a constant infiltration rate are available, the estimates can be used as a guide to decide whether surface or subsurface flow is the primary mechanism producing flood flows (Pearce and McKerchar, 1979).

{"paragraph": "5.1 SOURCES OF STREAMFLOW The watershed, or catchment, is the area of land draining into a stream at a given location. To describe how the*various surface water processes vary through time during a storm, suppose that precipitation of a constant rate begins and continues indefinitely on a watershed. Precipitation contributes to various storage and flow processes, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1.1. The vertical axis of this diagram represents, relative to the rate of precipitation, the rate at which water is flowing or being added to storage in each of the processes shown at any instant of time. Initially, a large proportion of the precipitation contributes to surface stor- age; as water infiltrates into the soil, there is also soil moisture storage. There are two types of storage: retention and detention; retention is storage held for a long period of time and depleted by evaporation, and detention is short-term storage depleted by flow away from the storage location. As the detention storages begin filling, flow away from them occurs: unsat- urated flow through the unsaturated soil near the land surface, groundwater flow through saturated aquifers deeper down, and overland flow across the land surface. 127 128 appLieED HYDROLOGY Channel precipitation 100% Channel flow Se linsncueniedl Overland flow——_____| Ground water flow prRtreraoale ttaece ti ipviet ation Infiltration s Interception and evapotranspiration 0 Time since precipitation began t a Detention om Retention FIGURE 5.1.1 Schematic iilustration of the disposal of precipitation during a storm on a watershed. Channel flow is the main form of surface water flow, and all the other surface flow processes contribute to it. Determining flow rates in stream channels is a central task of surface water hydrology. The precipitation which becomes streamflow may reach the stream by overland flow, subsurface flow, or both. Hortonian Overland Flow Horton (1933) described overland flow as follows: “Neglecting interception by vegetation, surface runoff is that part of the rainfall which is not absorbed by the soil by infiltration. If the soil has an infiltration capacity f, expressed in inches depth absorbed per hour, then when the rain intensity i is less than f the rain is all absorbed and there is no surface runoff. It may be said as a first approximation that if 7 is greater than f, surface runoff will occur at the rate (i — f).” Horton termed this difference (i — f) “rainfall excess.” Horton considered surface runoff to take the form of a sheet flow whose depth might be measured in fractions of an inch. As flow accumulates going down a slope, its depth increases until discharge into a stream channel occurs (Fig. 5.1.2). Along with overland flow there is depression storage in surface hollows and surface detention storage proportional to the depth of the overland flow itself. The soil stores infiltrated water and SURFACE WATER 129 Rainfall, 7 FIGURE 5.1.2 Overland flow on a slope produced by the excess of Outlet rainfall over infiltration. (After Horton, 1945, Fig. 13, p. 314.) then slowly releases it as subsurface flow to enter the stream as baseflow during rainless periods. Hortonian overland flow is applicable for impervious surfaces in urban areas, and for natural surfaces with thin soil layers and low infiltration capacity as in semiarid and arid lands. Subsurface Flow Hortonian overland flow occurs rarely on vegetated surfaces in humid regions (Freeze, 1972, 1974; Dunne, Moore, and Taylor, 1975). Under these conditions, the infiltration capacity of the soil exceeds observed rainfall intensities for all except the most extreme rainfalls. Subsurface flow then becomes a primary mechanism for transporting stormwater to streams. The process of subsurface flow is illustrated in Fig. 5.1.3, using the results of numerical simulations carried out by Freeze (1974). Part (a) shows an idealized cross section of a hillside draining into a stream. Prior to rainfall, the stream surface is. in equilibrium with the water table and no saturated subsurface flow occurs. Parts (b)—-(d) show how a seepage pattern develops from rainfall on surface DE, which serves to raise the water table (e) until inflow ceases (t = 277 min), after which the water table declines (f). All of the rainfall is infiltrated along surface DE until t = 84 min, when the soil first becomes saturated at D; as time continues, decreasing infiltration occurs along DE as progressively more of the surface becomes saturated (g). The total outflow (h) partly comprises saturated groundwater flow contributed directly to the stream and partly unsaturated subsurface flow seeping from the hillside above the water table. Subsurface flow velocities are normally so low that subsurface flow alone cannot contribute a significant amount of storm precipitation directly to stream- flow except under special circumstances where the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is very high (Pearce, Stewart, and Sklash, 1986). However, Moseley (1979) has suggested that flow through root holes in a forested soil can be much more rapid than flow through the adjacent soil mass. 130 apPLIED HYDROLOGY I = 0.005cm/sec Impermeable, but E beeeeeeeeee allowing seepage face development——*, Constant flux until from base with surface saturation; time constant head there- F after until specified A end of inflow; no in- Specified head flow or outflow thereafter Impermeable Initial conditions: static B Ee t= 44 min t=77 min (6) (c) Water table rise 218-2e7l7t — == = 40 t, min (e) (f) Outflow Inflow 14=218 ts = 277, eee E 0.25 els 1) 0.005 ° Total outflow al to gerd Direct into stream 8 5 0.15 Seepage face t=111 0.0082 3B Tang ‘ f= © 0.10 0 2 Z t=218 seco 7 S 0.05 -277| ~ P Bonn ; cImn3f/lsowe c/em E D 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Position on t, min inflow boundary (8) (h) FIGURE 5.1.3 Saturated-unsaturated subsurface flow in a small idealized two-dimensional flow system (a) Boundary and initial conditions.

SURFACE WATER 131 Saturation Overland Flow Saturation overland flow is produced when subsurface flow saturates the soil near the bottom of a slope and overland flow then occurs as rain falls onto saturated soil. Saturation overland flow differs from Hortonian overland flow in that in Hortonian overland flow the soil is saturated from above by infiltration, while in saturation overland flow it is saturated from below by subsurface flow. Saturation overland flow occurs most often at the bottom of hill slopes and near stream banks. The velocity of subsurface flow is so low that not all of a watershed can contribute subsurface flow or saturation overland flow to a stream during a storm. Forest hydrologists (Hewlett, 1982) have coined the terms variable source areas, or partial areas, to denote the area of the watershed actually contributing flow to the stream at any time (Betson, 1964; Ragan, 1968; Harr, 1977; Pearce and McKerchar, 1979; Hewlett, 1982). As shown in Fig. 5.1.4, the variable source area expands during rainfall and contracts thereafter. The source area for streamflow may constitute only 10 percent of the watershed during a storm in a humid, well vegetated region.

When rainfall infiltrates the soil, it raises the water table, allowing saturated subsurface flow to occur. As the water table rises, the area of saturated soil increases, enabling more water to flow through the soil and eventually contribute to streamflow. The water table's position and movement are essential in determining the extent and rate of subsurface flow."}, {"question": "How does saturation overland flow differ from Hortonian overland flow, and under what conditions does it occur?", "answer": "Saturation overland flow differs from Hortonian overland flow in that it is produced when subsurface flow saturates the soil near the bottom of a slope, and overland flow then occurs as rain falls onto saturated soil. In contrast, Hortonian overland flow occurs when the soil is saturated from above by infiltration. Saturation overland flow typically occurs at the bottom of hill slopes and near stream banks, where the soil is more prone to saturation due to the accumulation of subsurface flow."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of variable source areas important in understanding streamflow, and how does it relate to the expansion and contraction of the source area during rainfall?", "answer": "The concept of variable source areas is important in understanding streamflow because it recognizes that not all areas of a watershed contribute to streamflow at the same time. The source area expands during rainfall as more areas become saturated and contribute to streamflow, and contracts thereafter as the water table declines. This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamic nature of streamflow and the factors that influence it, such as soil moisture, infiltration capacity, and subsurface flow.

This concept is significant because it acknowledges that the source area for streamflow may constitute only a small portion of the watershed, typically around 10 percent, during a storm in a humid, well-vegetated region.

This has significant implications for watershed management, as it highlights the importance of considering the role of subsurface flow in streamflow generation and the need to manage watersheds in a way that takes into account the complex interactions between surface and subsurface flow processes. Additionally, the low velocity of subsurface flow means that it can play a crucial role in recharging groundwater aquifers, which can have long-term implications for water resources management."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.2 STREAMFLOW HYDROGRAPH A streamflow or discharge hydrograph is a graph or table showing the flow rate as a function of time at a given location on the stream. In effect, the hydrograph is “an integral expression of the physiographic and climatic characteristics that govern the relations between rainfall and runoff of a particular drainage basin” (Chow, 1959). Two types of hydrographs are particularly important: the annual hydrograph and the storm hydrograph. Annual Hydrograph The annual hydrograph, a plot of streamflow vs. time over a year, shows the long-term balance of precipitation, evaporation, and streamflow in a watershed. Examples typical of three main types of annual hydrographs are shown in Fig. Sih ths The first hydrograph, from Mill Creek near Belleville, Texas, has a peren- nial or continuous flow regime typical of a humid climate. The spikes, caused by rain storms, are called direct runoff or quickflow, while the slowly varying flow in rainless periods is called baseflow. The total volume of flow under the annual hydrograph is the basin yield. For a river with perennial flow most of the basin yield usually comes from baseflow, indicating that a large proportion of the rainfall is infiltrated into the basin and reaches the stream as subsurface flow. The second hydrograph, from the Frio River near Uvalde, Texas, is an example of an ephemeral river in an arid climate. There are long periods when the river is dry. Most storm rainfall becomes direct runoff and little infiltration occurs. Basin yield from this watershed is the result of direct runoff from large storms. The third hydrograph, from the East River near Almont, Colorado, is produced by a snow-fed river. The bulk of the basin yield occurs in the spring and early summer from snowmelt. The large volume of water stored in the snowpack, and its steady release, create an annual hydrograph which varies more smoothly over the year than for the perennial or ephemeral streams illustrated. Storm Hydrograph Study of annual hydrographs shows that peak streamflows are produced infre- quently, and are the result of storm rainfall alone or storm rainfall and snowmelt combined. Figure 5.2.2 shows four components of a streamflow hydrograph dur- ing a storm. Prior to the time of intense rainfall, baseflow is gradually diminishing (segment AB). Direct runoff begins at B, peaks at C and ends at D. Segment DE follows as normal baseflow recession begins again. Baseflow Separation A variety of techniques have been suggested for separating baseflow and direct runoff. One of the oldest is the normal depletion curve described by Horton 100,000 - 10,000 > 1,000 —S o=O 100 4 2= S 10 - l = 0.1 5 T “T T T Pe gs 2 Pal a * 7 i |a e 7 198] Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec (a) Mill Creek near Belville, Texas (watershed area = 376 mi) 100,000 5 10,000 4 ia 1,000 J oy 50 5 100 4 = 2 a 104 1 0.1 +— — aT (EN , 1981 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec (b) Frio River near Uvalde, Texas (watershed area = 661 mi- ) 10,000 5 2 50 2= e 10 4 1 4 QO.) }——— er 1981 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec (c) East River at Almont, Colorado (watershed area = 289 mi?)

(1933). The normal depletion curve, or master baseflow recession curve, iS a characteristic graph of flow recessions compiled by superimposing many of the recession curves observed on a given stream. Recession curves often take the form of exponential decay: O-=Qo7\"e © (5.2) where Qo is the flow at time fo and & is an exponential decay constant having the dimensions of time (Singh and Stall, 1971). Equation (5.2.1) is linearized by plotting the logarithm of Q(t) against time on a linear scale. In Northland, New Zealand, a typical value for k is 6 X 10~* days, which corresponds to a “half- life” of 116 days (Martin, 1973). The half-life is the time for baseflow to recede to the point where Q(t)/Qp = 0.5. The concept underlying Eq. (5.2.1) is that of a linear reservoir, whose outflow rate is proportional to the current storage (see Secarons): S(t) = kQ() (5.2.2) By noting the periods of time when the streamflow hydrograph is coincident. with the normal baseflow recession curve, the points where direct runoff begins and ceases can be identified (B and D on Fig. 5.2.2). Between these points direct runoff and baseflow can be separated by various methods. Some alternative methods of baseflow separation are: (a) the straight line method, (b) the fixed base length method, and (c) the variable slope method. These methods are illustrated in Figure 5.2.3. The straight line method, involves drawing a horizontal line from the point at which surface runoff begins to the intersection with the recession limb. This is applicable to ephemeral streams. An improvement over this approach is to use an inclined line to connect the beginning point of the surface runoff with the point on the recession limb of the hydrograph where normal baseflow resumes. For small forested watersheds in humid regions, Hewlett and Hibbert (1967) suggested that baseflow during a storm can be assumed to be increasing at a rate of 0.0055 I/s-ha-h (0.05 cfs/mi7h).

In the fixed base method, the surface runoff is assumed to end a fixed time N after the hydrograph peak. The baseflow before the surface runoff began is projected ahead to the time of the peak. A straight line is used to connect this projection at the peak to the point on the recession limb at time WN after the peak. In the variable slope method, the baseflow curve before the surface runoff began is extrapolated forward to the time of peak discharge, and the baseflow curve after surface runoff ceases is extrapolated backward to the time of the point of inflection on the recession limb. A straight line is used to connect the endpoints of the extrapolated curves. 5.3. EXCESS RAINFALL AND DIRECT RUNOFF Excess rainfall, or effective rainfall, is that rainfall which is neither retained on the land surface nor infiltrated into the soil. After flowing across the watershed surface, excess rainfall becomes direct runoff at the watershed outlet under the assumption of Hortonian overland flow. The graph of excess rainfall vs. time, or excess rainfall hyetograph (ERH), is a key component of the study of rainfall- runoff relationships. The difference between the observed total rainfall hyetograph and the excess rainfall hyetograph is termed abstractions, or losses. Losses are primarily water absorbed by infiltration with some allowance for interception and surface storage. The excess rainfall hytograph may be determined from the rainfall hyeto- graph in one of two ways, depending on whether streamflow data are available for 136 APPLIED HYDROLOGY the storm or not. In this section, it is assumed that streamflow data are available. Sections 5.4 and 5.5 show how to calculate abstractions when streamflow data are not available. Suppose that a rainfall hyetograph and streamflow hyetograph are avail- able, baseflow has been separated from streamflow to produce the direct runoff hydrograph, and the excess rainfall hyetograph is to be determined. The param- eters of infiltration equations can be determined by optimization techniques such as nonlinear programming (Unver and Mays, 1984), but these techniques are complicated. There is a simpler alternative, called a ¢-index. The ¢-index is that constant rate of abstractions (in/h or em/h) that will yield an excess rainfall hyetograph (ERH) with a total depth equal to the depth of direct runoff rg over the watershed. The value of ¢@ is determined by picking a time interval length At, judging the number of intervals M of rainfall that actually contribute to direct runoff, subtracting @Ar from the observed rainfall in each interval, and adjusting the values of d@ and M as necessary so that the depths of direct runoff and excess rainfall are equal: M ra = >, (Rm — PAD) (5.3.1) =1 where R,, is the observed rainfall (in) in time interval m. excess rainfall hyetograph from the observed rainfall and streamflow data given in Table 5.3.1. The watershed area is 7.03 mi?. Solution. The basin-average rainfall data given in column 2 of Table 5.3.1 were obtained by taking Thiessen-weighted averages of the rainfall data from two rainfall gages in the watershed. (Ideally, data from several more gages would be used.) The pulse data representation is used for rainfall with a time interval of At = 1/2 h, so each value shown in column 2 is the incremental precipitation that occurred during the half-hour up to the time shown. The streamflow data shown were recorded as sample data; the value shown in column 3 is the streamflow recorded at that instant of time. The observed rainfall and streamflow data are plotted in Fig. 5.3.1, from which it is apparent that rainfall prior to 9:30 P.M. produced a small fiow in the stream (approximately 400 cfs) and that the direct runoff occurred following intense rainfall between 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. The computation of the effective rainfall hyetograph and the direct runoff hydrograph uses the following procedure: Step I. Estimate the baseflow. A constant baseflow rate of 400 cfs is selected. Step 2. Calculate the direct runoff hydrograph (DRH). The DRH, in column 6 of Table 5.3.1, is found by the straight line method, by subtracting the 400 cfs baseflow from the observed streamflow (column 3). Eleven half-hour time intervals in column 4 are labeled from the first period of non-zero direct runoff, beginning at 9:30 P.M. Step 3. Compute the volume Vz and depth ry of direct runoff.

The ordinates (column 5) are found by subtracting @At = 0.27 in from the ordinates of the observed rainfall hyetograph (column 2), neglecting all intervals in which the observed rainfall depth is less than @At. The duration of excess rainfall is 1.5 h in this example (9:30 to 11:00 P.M.). The depth of excess rainfall is checked to ensure that it equals rq (total of column 5 = 4.80 in). The excess portion of the observed rainfall hyetograph is cross-hatched in Fig. 5.3.1. Runoff Coefficients Abstractions may also be accounted for by means of runoff coefficients. The most common definition of a runoff coefficient is that it is the ratio of the peak rate of direct runoff to the average intensity of rainfall in a storm. Because of highly variable rainfall intensity, this value is difficult to determine from observed data. A runoff coefficient can also be defined to be the ratio of runoff to rainfall over a given time period. These coefficients are most commonly applied to storm rainfall and runoff, but can also be used for monthly or annual rainfall and streamflow data. If > mae Rm is the total rainfall and rg the corresponding depth of runoff, then a runoff coefficient can be defined as Gaewt sae. (5.3.2) SM e m=\\1 140 = apPpLiED HYDROLOGY Solution.

{"paragraph": "5.4 ABSTRACTIONS USING INFILTRATION EQUATIONS Abstractions include interception of precipitation on vegetation above the ground, depression storage on the ground surface as water accumulates in hollows over the surface, and infiltration of water into the soil. Interception and depression storage abstractions are estimated based on the nature of the vegetation and ground surface or are assumed to be negligible in a large storm. In the previous section, the rate of abstractions from rainfall was determined by using a known streamflow hydrograph. In most hydrologic problems, the streamflow hydrograph is not available and the abstractions must be determined by calculating infiltration and accounting separately for other forms of abstrac- tion, such as interception, and detention or depression storage. In this section, it is assumed that all abstractions arise from infiltration, anc a method for determining the ponding time and infiltration under a variable intensity rainfall is developed based on the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Equivalent relationships for use with the Horton and Philip equations are presented in Table 5.4.1. The problem considered is: given a rainfall hyetograph defined using the pulse data repre- sentation, and the parameters of an infiltration equation, determine the ponding time, the infiltration after ponding occurs, and the excess rainfall hyetograph. The basic principles used for determining ponding time under constant rain- fall intensity in Sec. 4.4 are also employed here: in the absence of ponding, cumulative infiltration is calculated from cumulative rainfall; the potential infil- tration rate at a given time is calculated from the cumulative infiltration at that time; and ponding has occurred when the potential infiltration rate is less than or equal to the rainfall intensity. e e —S N b I a S V t l \\ — s.diyiyg u o n e n b a — I V A -= z i : f S + 1 9 — — — — J p— z y + S + 2 S / - “ O Y Wes | S y += ]|s+ + § = y V t e l 4 V l V u l p u o d s,u0}.10}] u o n e n b a e e 1 ) = ( y y ?

The rainfall intensity during - this interval is denoted i, and is constant throughout the interval. The potential infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration at the beginning of the interval are f, and F,, respectively, and the corresponding values at the end of the interval are fr+ar and F,44;. It is assumed that F, is known from given initial conditions or previous computation. A flow chart for determining ponding time is presented in Fig 5.4.1. There are three cases to be considered: (1) ponding occurs throughout the interval; (2) there is no ponding throughout the interval; and (3) ponding begins part-way through the interval. The infiltration rate is always either decreasing or constant with time, so once ponding is established under a given rainfall intensity, it will continue. Hence, ponding cannot cease in the middle of an interval, but only at its end point, when the value of the rainfall intensity changes. Following the flow chart, the first step is to calculate the current potential infiltration rate f,; from the known value of cumulative infiltration F,. For the Green-Ampt method, one uses fi = “ee + 1 (5.4.1) F, } The result f; is compared to the rainfall intensity 7, If f, is less than or equal to i,, case (1) arises and there is ponding throughout the interval.

Assume that this remains so throughout the interval; then, the infiltration rate is i, and a tentative value for cumulative infiltration at the end of the time interval is Next, a corresponding infiltration rate f; +4; is calculated from Fj 4,;. If f) +a, is greater than 7,, case (2) occurs and there is no ponding throughout the interval. Thus F 4a; = F; +a; and the problem is solved for this interval. If f7 +a; is less than or equal to i,, ponding occurs during the interval (case (3)).

The excess rainfall values are calculated by subtracting 144 9 appLiep HYDROLOGY cumulative infiltration from cumulative rainfall, then taking successive differences of the resulting values. If this rain falls on a sandy loam soil of initial effective saturation 40 percent, determine the excess rainfall hyetograph. Solution. From Table 4.3.1, for a sandy loam soil, K = 1.09 cm/h, w= 11.01 cm and 0, = 0.412. From Eq. (4.3.10) AG= (se, =(1 — 0:4)(0-.412) =0.247 and AO=0.247 x 11.01 =2.72 cm The time interval in Table 5.4.2 is Ar = 10 min = 0.167 h. Column 3 of the table shows the cumulative rainfall depths found by summing the incremental values in column 2. The rainfall hyetograph and the cumulative rainfall hyetograph are shown in Fig. 5.4.2. The rainfall intensity in column 4 is found from column 2 by dividing by Art. For example, during the first time interval, 0.18 cm of rainfall occurs, so i, = 0.18/0.167 = 1.08 cm/h as shown. Initially, F = 0, so f = © from (5.4.1) and ponding does not occur at time 0. Hence F ai time 10 min is calculated by (5.4.3), thus: F744, = F, + i, At = 0 + 0.18 = 0.18 cm.

Urbanization Effects During the past 15 to 20 years, hydrologists have paid considerable attention to the effects of urbanization. Early works in urban hydrology were concerned with the effects of urbanization on the flood potential of small urban watersheds. The effects of urbanization on the flood hydrograph include increased total runoff volumes and peak flow rates, as depicted in Fig. 5.5.3. In general, the major changes in flow rates in urban watersheds are due to the following: 1. The volume of water available for runoff increases because of the increased impervious cover provided by parking lots, streets, and roofs, which reduce the amount of infiltration. Total rainfall svo 7 Additional excess rainfall = GZ caused by urbanization is & FO f 3 +— Infiltration before urbanization +— Infiltration after urbanization 1 __pe Time 4 S : 3 Runoff = After urbanization § Before urbanization ~ wn FIGURE 5.5.3 + The effect of urbanization Time on storm runoff.

Changes in hydraulic efficiency associated with artificial channels, curbing, gutters, and storm drainage collection systems increase the velocity of flow and the magnitude of flood peaks. The SCS method for rainfall-runoff analysis can be applied to determine the increase in the amount of runoff caused by urbanization. watershed. The soil is 50 percent Group B and 50 percent Group C. Assume antecedent moisture condition I]. The land use is open land with fair grass cover before urbanization; after urbanization it is as specified in Example 5.5.1. How much additional runoff is caused by urbanization? Solution. The curve numbers for open land with fair grass cover are CN = 69 for Group B and 79 for Group C, so the average curve number for the watershed is CN = (69 + 79)/2 = 74. From (5.5.6), S = (1000/74) — 10 = 3.51 in.

Time Distribution of SCS Abstractions To this point, only the depth of excess rainfall or direct runoff during a storm has been computed. By extension of the previous method, the time distribution of abstractions F,, within a storm can be found. Solving for F, from Eqs.

This is significant because it represents the amount of rainfall that is lost to infiltration and other processes before runoff begins."}, {"question": "In the context of urbanization effects on hydrology, why do increased impervious cover and changes in hydraulic efficiency lead to increased total runoff volumes and peak flow rates?", "answer": "Increased impervious cover reduces the amount of infiltration, resulting in more water available for runoff. Changes in hydraulic efficiency, such as the use of artificial channels and storm drainage collection systems, increase the velocity of flow and the magnitude of flood peaks. This is because impervious surfaces and efficient drainage systems allow water to flow more quickly into streams and rivers, leading to increased runoff volumes and peak flow rates."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the curve number CN in the SCS method, and how is it related to the potential maximum retention S?", "answer": "The curve number CN is a dimensionless value that standardizes the curves of excess rainfall versus total rainfall for different watersheds. It is related to the potential maximum retention S by the equation 1000/CN - 10 = S, where S is in inches. This relationship allows for the calculation of S, which is used to determine the depth of excess rainfall or direct runoff."}, {"question": "How does the SCS method account for antecedent moisture conditions, and what are the implications of these conditions on runoff calculations?", "answer": "The SCS method accounts for antecedent moisture conditions through the use of curve numbers, which can be adjusted based on the antecedent moisture condition (AMC). The AMC is classified into three categories: I (dry), II (normal), and III (wet). The curve number for AMC II is used as a base, and adjustments are made for AMC I and III using equations (5.5.7) and (5.5.8). The implications of these conditions on runoff calculations are significant, as they can result in changes to the amount of runoff generated from a storm. For example, a change from AMC II to AMC III can result in a 27% increase in runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of the time distribution of SCS abstractions, how does the rate of retention of water within the watershed change with increasing rainfall intensity?", "answer": "According to the SCS method, the rate of retention of water within the watershed tends to increase with increasing rainfall intensity. This is because the equation for the rate of retention, dF,/dt, includes the rainfall intensity dP/dt in the numerator. However, this property of the SCS method may not have a strong physical basis, as noted by Morel-Seytoux and Verdin (1981)."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of the SCS method in terms of its physical basis, and how might this impact its application in certain contexts?", "answer": "The SCS method has limitations in terms of its physical basis, particularly with regards to the time distribution of abstractions. The method assumes that the rate of retention of water within the watershed increases with increasing rainfall intensity, which may not always be the case. This limitation might impact the method's application in contexts where the physical processes governing runoff generation are complex or non-linear. For example, in watersheds with significant groundwater storage or complex soil structures, the SCS method may not accurately capture the dynamics of runoff generation."}, {"question": "How does the SCS method handle the calculation of cumulative abstractions and excess rainfall hyetograph, and what are the implications of these calculations for runoff modeling?", "answer": "The SCS method calculates cumulative abstractions and excess rainfall hyetograph using equations (5.5.9) and (5.5.5). The implications of these calculations are significant for runoff modeling, as they allow for the determination of the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff and the timing of this runoff. This information is critical for predicting flood peaks and volumes, as well as for designing stormwater management systems. However, the accuracy of these calculations depends on the accuracy of the input parameters, such as the curve number and initial abstraction, which can be subject to uncertainty and variability."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.6 FLOW DEPTH AND VELOCITY The flow of water over a watershed surface is a complicated process varying in all three space dimensions and time. It begins when water becomes ponded on the surface at sufficient depth to overcome surface retention forces and begins to flow. Two basic flow types may be distinguished: overland flow and channel flow. Overland flow has a thin layer of water flowing over a wide surface. Channel flow has a much narrower stream of water flowing in a confined path. Chapter 2 gave the physical laws applicable to these two types of flow. On a natural watershed, overland flow is the first mechanism of surface flow but it may persist for only a short distance (say up to 100 ft) before nonuniformities in the watershed surface concentrate the flow into tortuous channels. Gradually, the outflows from these small channels combine to produce recognizable stream channel flows which accumulate going downstream to form streamflow at the watershed outlet. Surface water flow is governed by the principles of continuity and momentum. The application of these principles to three-dimensional unsteady flow on a watershed surface is possible only in very simplified situations, so one- or two-dimensional flow is usually assumed. Overland Flow Overland flow is a very thin sheet flow which occurs at the upper end of slopes before the flow concentrates into recognizable channels. Figure 5.6.1 shows flow down a uniform plane on which rain is falling at intensity i and infiltration occurring at rate f. Sufficient time has passed since rainfall began that all flows are steady. The plane is of unit width and length Lo, and is inclined at angle 6 to the horizontal with slope So = tan 0. Continuity. The continuity equation (2.2.5) for steady, constant density flow is |[ va =0 (5.6.1) c.S. The inflow to the control volume from rainfall is iLp cos 6, and the outflow is flo cos @ from infiltration plus Vy from overland flow.

For uniform laminar flow on an inclined plane, it can be shown (Roberson and Crowe, 1985), that the average velocity Vis given by 2 y = Soy (5.6.3) 3y where g is acceleration due to gravity and v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. For uniform flow, So = S¢ = hy/L, and (5.6.3) can be rearranged to yield Raa (5.6.4) 1 Wy 4y 2g 2 which is in the form of the Darcy-Weisbach equation (2.5.1) for flow resistance LD Ve hpL f =p VaR 2g (.6:9) with the friction factor f = 96/Re in which the Reynolds number Re = 4VR/», and the hydraulic radius R = y. For a unit width sheet flow, R = area/(wetted perimeter) =y X 1/1 = y, as required. The flow remains laminar provided Re S 2000. For laminar sheet flow under rainfall, the friction factor increases with the rainfall intensity.

The increase in flow resistance results primarily from the unevenness in the topography and surface vegetation. Equation (5.6.8) can be rewritten in the more general form y = aqg (5.6.9) For laminar flow m = 2/3 and a = (f/8gSo)'/3. Emmett’s studies indicate that the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f is in the range 20-200 for overland flow at field sites. When the flow becomes turbulent, the friction factor becomes independent of the Reynolds number and dependent only on the roughness of the surface. In this case, Manning’s equation (2.5.7) is applicable to describe the flow: is sarcoAr ea (5.6.10) with R = y, Ss = So for uniform flow, and go = Vy. This can be solved for y to yield 3/5 49nsqot ?

Take v = 1.2 x 1075 ft?/s. Solution. The Reynolds number is Re = 4go/v = 4 X 2.31 X 10 77/1.2 x 10-5=770 (laminar flow), and a = (f/8gS0)'3 = (75/(8 X 32.2 x 0.05)) /3 = 1.80.

Solution. The discharge per unit width is given by Eq. (5.6.2) with i = 10 in/h = 2.32 x 10° ft/s,f = 0, and @ = tan~!(0.02) = 1.15°, for which cos 6 = 1.00: go = (i — f)Lo cos 6 = 2.32 x 10°? «200 x 1,00 = 0.0464 cfs/ft The Reynolds number is Re = 4qo/v = 4 X 0.046/(1.2 x 10 ~5) = 15333, so the flow is turbulent. The depth of flow is given by Eq.

Consider a channel of length L, that is fed by overland flow from a plane as shown in Fig. 5.6.2. The overland flow has discharge qo per unit width, so the discharge in the channel is Q = goL,. To find the depth and velocity at various points along the channel, an iterative solution of Manning’s equation is necessary. Manning’s equation is Q= 1.49 5124 p23 (5.6.12) n 160 appLIED HYDROLOGY FIGURE 5.6.2 Overland flow from a plane into a channel. Solution of Manning’s Equation by Newton’s Method There is no general analytical solution to Manning’s equation for determining the flow depth given the flow rate because the area A and hydraulic radius R may be complicated functions of the depth.

This relationship highlights the importance of considering the rainfall intensity when modeling overland flow and its impact on watershed hydrology."}, {"question": "How does the passage of overland flow into a channel affect the flow dynamics, and what are the implications for watershed hydrology?", "answer": "The passage of overland flow into a channel can be viewed as a lateral flow, which affects the flow dynamics and the overall hydrological behavior of the watershed. As the overland flow enters the channel, it contributes to the channel flow, and the flow rate increases along the channel. This process has significant implications for watershed hydrology, including the prediction of flood peaks, the design of drainage systems, and the management of water resources. Understanding the dynamics of overland flow and its interaction with channel flow is crucial for effective watershed management and hydrological modeling."}, {"question": "In the context of overland flow, why is it essential to consider the spatial and temporal variations in flow, and how do these variations affect the hydrological behavior of the watershed?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the spatial and temporal variations in overland flow because they significantly affect the hydrological behavior of the watershed. The flow varies both in space and time, and the steady flow at equilibrium is approached asymptotically. This variation has implications for the prediction of flood peaks, the design of drainage systems, and the management of water resources. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations in overland flow is crucial for effective watershed management and hydrological modeling, as it allows for more accurate predictions and better decision-making."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in modeling overland flow, and how do these challenges impact the accuracy of hydrological predictions?", "answer": "The challenges in modeling overland flow include the complexity of the flow dynamics, the variability of the watershed topography and surface roughness, and the uncertainty in the model parameters.

{"paragraph": "5.8 STREAM NETWORKS In fluid mechanics, the study of the similarity of fluid flow in systems of differ- ent sizes is an important tool in relating the results of small-scale model studies to large-scale prototype applications. In hydrology, the geomorphology of the watershed, or quantitative study of the surface landform, is used to arrive at mea- sures of geometric similarity among watersheds, especially among their stream networks. The quantitative study of stream networks was originated by Horton (1945). He developed a system for ordering stream networks and derived laws relating the number and length of streams of different order. Horton’s stream ordering system, as slightly modified by Strahler (1964), is as follows: The smallest recognizable channels are designated order 1; these channels normally flow only during wet weather. SURFACE WATER Where two channels of order | join, a channel of order 2 results downstream; in general, where two channels of order i join, a channel of order i + 1 results. Where a channel of lower order joins a channel of higher order, the channel downstream retains the higher of the two orders. The order of the drainage basin is designated as the order of the stream draining its outlet, the highest stream order in the basin, J. An example of this classification system for a small watershed in Texas is shown in Fig. 5.8.1.

The theoretical minimum value of the bifurcation ratio is 2, and values typically lie in the range 3-5 (Strahler, 1964). By measuring the length of each stream, the average ‘length of streams of each order, L;, can be found. Horton proposed a Law of Stream Lengths in which the average lengths of streams of successive orders are related by a length ratio Rr: = Rr, (5.8.2) By a similar reasoning, Schumm (1956) proposed a Law of Stream Areas to relate the average areas A; drained by streams of successive order AiH+ 1 (5.8.3) = R, 65 Mamon 5 Mamon 104 Aj L; = _— { 100 r 10 i & g & Ono a", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of fluid mechanics and hydrology, what is the significance of studying the similarity of fluid flow in systems of different sizes?", "answer": "The study of similarity in fluid flow allows for relating the results of small-scale model studies to large-scale prototype applications, which is crucial for understanding and predicting hydrological phenomena."}, {"question": "How does Horton's stream ordering system classify streams based on their order, and what are the implications of this classification?", "answer": "Horton's system classifies streams based on their order, starting with the smallest recognizable channels as order 1, which normally flow only during wet weather.

The drainage density, which is the ratio of the total length of stream channels to the watershed area, affects the runoff response and the flood hydrograph. The length of overland flow, on the other hand, influences the time of concentration and the peak discharge.

This relationship can be used to estimate the flow rate and volume of water in subsurface storage. By analyzing the baseflow recession and using the linear reservoir model, hydrologists can estimate the flow rate at a given time and the volume of water in subsurface storage. For instance, if the baseflow on a river is 100 cfs on July 1 and 80 cfs on July 10, and the previous study has shown that the baseflow recession follows the linear reservoir model, then the flow rate on July 31 and the volume of water in subsurface storage on July 1 and July 31 can be estimated using this relationship."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the initial effective saturation of the soil when determining the excess rainfall hyetograph, and how does this factor affect the calculation of excess rainfall?", "answer": "The initial effective saturation of the soil is a critical factor in determining the excess rainfall hyetograph because it affects the amount of rainfall that can infiltrate the soil. If the soil is already saturated, then all the rainfall will become excess rainfall, whereas if the soil is dry, some of the rainfall will infiltrate, reducing the amount of excess rainfall. By considering the initial effective saturation of the soil, hydrologists can accurately calculate the excess rainfall and the resulting runoff. For example, if the initial effective saturation of the soil is 60%, then the excess rainfall hyetograph will be different from the case where the initial effective saturation is 40%. This highlights the importance of considering the initial soil moisture conditions when analyzing rainfall-runoff relationships."}, {"question": "How do Horton's equation and Philip's equation differ in their approach to modeling infiltration, and what are the implications of these differences for hydrologic analysis?", "answer": "Horton's equation and Philip's equation are two different approaches to modeling infiltration. Horton's equation assumes that the infiltration rate decreases exponentially with time, whereas Philip's equation assumes that the infiltration rate decreases with the square root of time. These differences in approach affect the calculation of excess rainfall and the resulting runoff. Horton's equation is more suitable for soils with a high initial infiltration rate, while Philip's equation is more suitable for soils with a low initial infiltration rate. The choice of equation depends on the soil type and the initial moisture conditions, and hydrologists must carefully select the appropriate equation to ensure accurate predictions and analyses."}, {"question": "In the context of urban hydrology, what is the significance of the ¢-index and the cumulative infiltration curve in understanding the rainfall-runoff relationship, and how can these concepts be applied to determine the direct runoff hydrograph?", "answer": "The ¢-index and the cumulative infiltration curve are essential concepts in urban hydrology as they help in understanding the rainfall-runoff relationship.

A higher CN indicates more impervious surfaces and less infiltration, leading to higher runoff and less abstraction. Conversely, a lower CN suggests more pervious surfaces, resulting in higher infiltration and less runoff. The choice of CN, therefore, directly influences the estimation of runoff and abstraction, making it a critical parameter in hydrological analyses, especially for designing stormwater management systems and predicting flood risks."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the SCS method for abstractions to determine the representative SCS curve number for a watershed, assuming AMC II conditions?", "answer": "Using the SCS method for abstractions to determine the representative SCS curve number for a watershed, assuming AMC II conditions, has significant implications for runoff prediction and water resource management. The curve number determined under these conditions can be used to estimate runoff for different rainfall events, which is essential for designing drainage systems, predicting flood risks, and managing water quality.

For instance, in a trapezoidal channel, the uniform flow depth can be computed using the equation that takes into account the base width, side slopes, n, So, and Q. A change in any of these parameters can affect the flow depth, velocity, and discharge capacity of the channel, which is critical for channel design, flood control, and water conveyance systems. Understanding these relationships is essential for hydrologists and engineers to design and manage channel systems efficiently."}, {"question": "In the context of rainfall-runoff processes, why is it essential to consider the infiltration rate and surface roughness when calculating discharge per unit width, depth, and velocity at the bottom end of a plane or slope?", "answer": "Considering the infiltration rate and surface roughness is essential when calculating discharge per unit width, depth, and velocity because these factors significantly affect the runoff process. Infiltration rate influences how much rainfall becomes runoff, while surface roughness affects the flow velocity and depth. For impervious surfaces, all rainfall may become runoff, but for pervious surfaces like grass, a significant portion may infiltrate, reducing runoff. Surface roughness, such as that provided by vegetation or urban features, can slow down runoff, increasing the time of concentration and affecting peak discharge rates. Accurate consideration of these factors is vital for predicting runoff characteristics and designing effective stormwater management systems."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in applying infiltration models, such as the Green-Ampt equation, to real-world scenarios, and how can these challenges be addressed?", "answer": "Applying infiltration models like the Green-Ampt equation to real-world scenarios poses challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural systems. Factors such as spatial variability of soil properties, initial moisture conditions, and the presence of impervious surfaces can complicate model application.

These data are used to better understand these processes and as a direct input into hydrologic simulation models for design, analysis, and decision making. A rapid expansion of hydrologic data collection worldwide was fostered by the Interna- tional Hydrologic Decade (1965-1974), and it has become a routine practice to store hydrologic data on computer files and to make the data available in a machine-readable form, such as on magnetic tapes or disks.

{"paragraph": "6.1 HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT SEQUENCE Although hydrologic processes vary continuously in time and space, they are usually measured as point samples, measurements made through time at a fixed location in space. For example, rainfall varies continuously in space over a water- shed, but a rain gage measures the rainfall at a specific point in the watershed. The resulting data form a time series, which may be subjected to statistical analysis. In recent years, some progress has been made in measuring distributed samples over a line or area in space at a specific point in time. For example, estimates of winter snow cover are made by flying an aircraft over the snow field and measuring the radiation reflected from the snow. The resulting data form a space series. Distributed samples are most often measured at some distance from the phenomenon being observed; this is termed remote sensing. Whether the data are measured as a time series or as a space series, a similar sequence of steps is followed. The sequence of steps commonly followed for hydrologic measurement is shown in Fig. 6.1.1, beginning with the physical device which senses or reacts to the physical phenomenon and ending with the delivery of data to a user. These steps are now described. 1. Sensing. A sensor is an instrument that translates the level or intensity of the phenomenon into an observable signal. For example, a mercury thermometer senses temperature through the expansion or contraction of the volume of mercury within a thin tube; a storage rain gage collects the incoming rainfall in a can or tube. Sensors may be direct or indirect. A direct sensor measures the phenomenon itself, as with the storage rain gage; an indirect sensor measures a variable related to the phenomenon, as with the mercury thermometer. Many hydrologic variables are measured indirectly, including streamflow, temperature, humidity, and radiation. Sensors for the major hydrologic variables are discussed in the subsequent sections of this chapter. 2. Recording. A recorder is a device or procedure for preserving the signal produced by the sensor. Manual recording simply involves an observer taking readings off the sensor and tabulating them for future reference. Most of the available.rainfall data are produced by observers who read the level in a storage rain gage each day at a fixed time (e.g., 9 A.M.). Automatic recording requires a device which accepts the signal from the sensor and stores it on a paper chart or punched tape, or an electronic memory including magnetic disks or tapes. Paper records require a mechanical system of pulleys or levers to translate the motion of the sensor to the motion of a pen on a chart or a punching mechanism for a paper tape. Fig. 6.1.2 shows hydrologic paper chart and tape recorders in common use. Historically, charts were the first recorders widely used in hydrology; they are still used when there is a need to have a direct visual image of the record, but charts have a great disadvantage in that translation of the chart record into a computerized form is a tedious procedure, involving manually tracking the line on the chart and recording the points where it changes direction. By contrast, paper tape recorders can be directly read by a computer.

Transmission. Transmission is the transfer of a record from a remote recording site to a central location. Transmission may be done routinely, such as by manually changing the chart or tape on a recorder at regular intervals (from one week to several months in duration) and carrying the records to the central location. A rapidly developing area of hydrology is real-time transmission of data through microwave networks, satellites, or teleyhone lines. The recorder site is “polled” by the central location when data are needed; the recorder has the data already electronically stored and sends them back to the central location immediately. Microwave transmitters operate with relatively short-wavelength electromagnetic waves (1 07! to 10-3 m) traveling directly over the land surface with the aid of repeater stations; satellite data transmission uses radio waves (1 to 178 APPLIED HYDROLOGY FIGURE 6.1.2(a) Digital recorder for hydrologic data. The i6-track paper tape moves vertically behind the metal plate shown in the center of the picture. At predetermined intervals (usually every 15 minutes) the plate pushes the tape back against a set of needles, one for each track on the tape. The needles, in turn, are pushed back against the two rimmed wheels —if the needle hits one of the raised rims, it punches through the tape, if not, the tape is left blank. In this way, a pattern of holes emerges across the 16 tracks, 8 of which are used for recording the level of the phenomenon, and 8 for recording the time at which the punch was made. The rimmed disks, one for time and one for measurement level, rotate as time passes and the level of the phenomenon changes. (Source: T. J. Buchanan, U.S. Geological Survey.

Microwave and satellite transmission of data are valuable for producing flood forecasts and for providing continuous access to remote recording sites which are difficult to reach by land travel. 4. Translation. Translation is the conversion of a record from a field instru- ment form into a computerized record for permanent electronic storage. For exam- ple, translators are available which read 16-track hydrologic paper tape records and produce an electronic signal in a form readable by computers. Cassette readers and chart followers are other devices of this type. 5. Editing. Editing is the procedure of checking the records translated into the computer to correct any obvious errors which have occurred during any of HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT 179 FIGURE 6.1.2(5) Paper chart recorder attached to a float for recording water level variation: Rises or falls in the float level move the pen horizontally, parallel to the front of the recorder case.

Buchanan, U.S. Geological Survey.) the previous steps. Common errors include mistakes in the automatic timing of recorded measurements and information lost in transmission and translation, which is filled in by directly analyzing the record made at the recorder site. 6. Storage. Edited data are stored in a computerized data archive such as WATSTORE, operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, or TNRIS (Texas Natural Resource Information System). Such archives contain many millions of hydrologic data systematically compiled into files indexed by location and sequenced by the time of measurement. 7. Retrieval.

However, indirect sensors are often necessary due to the challenges of directly measuring certain hydrologic variables, and they can still provide valuable insights when properly calibrated and interpreted."}, {"question": "How does the development of real-time transmission technologies, such as microwave networks and satellites, impact hydrologic forecasting and decision-making?", "answer": "The development of real-time transmission technologies significantly enhances hydrologic forecasting and decision-making by providing immediate access to data from remote locations. This capability is particularly critical for applications like flood forecasting, where timely and accurate data can significantly impact the effectiveness of response measures. Real-time data transmission enables more precise and reliable forecasting, allowing for better decision-making and potentially saving lives and reducing damage."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.2 MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC WATER Atmospheric Moisture The measurement of moisture high in the atmosphere is made by means of a radiosonde, which is a balloon filled with helium that is attached to a measuring 180 AppLiED HYDROLOGY device recording temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The balloon is released, and as it rises in the atmosphere, it sends the data back to a field tracking station. At the tracking station, the balloon is tracked by radar as it rises, and the wind speed at various elevations is thereby observed. The measurement of atmospheric moisture and climate parameters near the ground is accomplished at a climate station. A climate station commonly contains, within a screened box, thermometers for measuring the maximum and minimum air temperatures each day, and a wet- and dry-bulb thermometer or hygrometer, to measure humidity; nearby are located precipitation gages, and sometimes an evaporation pan and an anemometer. For detailed measurements of climate variables, special weather stations are installed at the testing site, and the data can be accumulated and sent by microwave to a central recording station as described previously. The measurement of radiation is accomplished with a device known as a radiometer, which relies on the principle that a black body will have a temperature proportional to the amount of radiation it receives. By measuring this temperature, the intensity of the incident radiation can be deduced. Rainfall Rainfall is recorded by two types of gages: nonrecording gages and recording gages. A recording gage is a device that automatically records the depth of rainfall in intervals down to one minute in duration. Nonrecording gages are read manually at longer time intervals. Nonrecording gages generally consist of open receptacles with vertical sides, in which the depth of precipitation is measured by a graduated measuring cylinder or dipstick. The two types of nonrecording gages are standard gages and storage gages. Standard gages are ordinarily used for daily rainfall readings and consist of a collector above a funnel leading into a receiver. Rain gages for locations where only weekly or monthly readings are used are similar in design to the daily type but have a larger capacity receiver. Storage gages are used to measure rainfall over an entire season, usually in remote, sparsely inhabited areas. These rain gages consist of a collector above a funnel that leads into a storage area large enough for the season rainfall volume. Standard gages are the most widespread rainfall data measurement devices used in hydrology. Many thousands of these gages are read by voluntary observers, and their data are recorded by weather services. There are three types of recording rain gages in general use: the weighing type, the float type, and the tipping bucket type. A weighing type rain gage continuously records the weight of the receiving can plus the accumulated rainfall by means of a spring mechanism or a system of balance weights (Fig. 6.2.1). These gages are designed to prevent excessive evaporation losses by the addition of oil or other evaporation-suppressing material to form a film over the surface. Weighing rain gages are useful in recording snow, hail, and mixtures of snow and rain. A float type rain gage has a chamber containing a float that rises vertically as the water level in the chamber rises. Vertical movement of the float is translated HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT 181 FIGURE 6.2.1 Recording rain gage with the top removed. The gage records the weight of precipitation received through the circular opening, which is 4 inches in diameter. (Source: L. A. Reed, U.S. Geological Survey. First published as Fig. 2 in USGS Water Supply Paper 1798-M, 1976.) into movement of a pen on a chart. A device for siphoning the water out of the gage is used so that the total amount of rainfall falling can be collected. A tipping bucket type rain gage operates by means of a pair of buckets (Fig. 6.2.2). The rainfall first fills one bucket, which overbalances, directing the flow of water into the second bucket. The flip-flop motion of the tipping buckets is transmitted to the recording device and provides a measure of the rainfall intensity. Whether a rain gage operates by the vertical rise of a float, the accumulation of weight, or the tipping of a bucket, the movement can be recorded. A drum or strip chart is rotated by a spring or electrically driven clock past a pen whose motion is linked to that of the float, weighing device, or tipping bucket system. The motion of the mechanism can also be converted into an electrical signal and FIGURE 6.2.2 Tipping bucket rain gage. (Source: Ministry of Works and Development, New Zealand.) 182 APPLIED HYDROLOGY transmitted to a distant receiver. Rain gages commonly have a windbreak device constructed around them in order to minimize the amount of distortion in the measurement of rainfall caused by the wind flow pattern around the gage. Radar can be used to observe the location and movement of areas of precipitation. Certain types of radar equipment can provide estimates of rainfall rates over areas within the range of the radar (World Meteorological Organiza- tion, 1981). Radar is sometimes used to get a visual image of the pattern of rainfall-producing thunderstorms and is particularly useful for tracking the move- ment of tornadoes. The introduction of color digital radar has made it possible to measure rainfall in distant thunderstorms with more precision than was formerly possible. The phenomenon upon which weather radar depends is the reflection of microwaves emitted by the radar transmitter by the droplets of water in the storm. The degree of reflection is related to the density of the droplets and therefore to the rainfall intensity. Snowfall Snowfall is recorded as part of precipitation in rain gages. In regions where there is a continuous snow cover, the measurement of the depth and density of this snow cover is important in predicting the runoff which will result when the snow cover melts. This is accomplished by means of surveyed snow courses, which are sections of the snow cover whose depth is determined by means of gages that have been installed prior to the snowfall. The density of snow in the snowpack may be determined by boring a hole through the pack or into the pack and measuring the amount of liquid water obtained from the sample. Automated devices for measuring the weight of the snow above a certain point in the ground have been developed—these include snow pillows, which measure the pressure of snow on a plastic pillow filled with a nonfreezing fluid. Interception The amount of precipitation captured by vegetation and trees is determined by comparing the precipitation in gages beneath the vegetation with that recorded nearby under the open sky. The precipitation detained by interception is dissipated as stem flow down the trunks of the trees and evaporation from the leaf surface. Stem flow may be measured by catch devices around tree trunks. Evaporation The most common method of measuring evaporation is by means of an evapora- tion pan. There are various types of evaporation pans; however, the most yadely used are the U.S. Class A pan, the U.S.S.R. GGI-3000 pan, and the 20-m? tank (World Meteorological Organization, 1981). The Class A pan measures 25.4 cm (10 in) deep and 120.67 cm (4 ft) in diameter and is constructed of Monel metal or unpainted galvanized iron. The pan is placed on timber supports so that air HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT 183 Summary of pan coefficients (after Linsley, Kohler, and Paulhus, 1982) Class A Location: Pan Coefficient Felt Lake, California 0.77 Ft.

The U.S.S.R. GGI-3000 pan is a 61.8-cm diameter tank with a conical base fabricated of galvanized sheet iron. The surface area is 0.3 m?; the tank is 60 cm deep at the wall and 68.5 cm deep at the center. The tank is sunk in the ground with the rim projecting approximately 7.5 cm above ground level. In addition to the pan, several other instruments are used at evaporation stations: (1) an anemometer located | to 2 meters above the pan, for determining wind movement; (2) a nonrecording precipitation gage; (3) a thermometer to measure water temperature in the pan; and (4) a thermometer for air temperature, or a psychrometer where temperature and humidity of the air are desired. By measuring the water level in the pan each day, the amount of evaporation which has occurred can be deduced after accounting for the precipitation during that day. The depth of the water in the pan is measured to the nearest hundredth of an inch by means of a hook gage or by adding the amount of water necessary to raise its level to a fixed point. The evaporation recorded in a pan is greater than that which would be recorded from the same area of water surface in a very large lake. Adjustment factors or pan coefficients have been determined to convert the data recorded in evaporation pans so that they correspond to the evaporation from large open water surfaces. Table 6.2.1 lists pan evaporation coefficients for various locations. Evapotranspiration Evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration through the plant leaves, or evapotranspiration, may be measured by means of lysimeters. A lysimeter is a tank of soil in which vegetation is planted that resembles the surrounding ground cover. The amount of evapotranspiration from the lysimeter is measured by means of a water balance of all moisture inputs and outputs. The precipitation on the lysimeter, the drainage through its bottom, and the changes in the soil moisture within the lysimeter are all measured. The amount of evapotranspiration is the amount necessary to coraplete the water balance. 184 apPpLiED HYDROLOGY Recorder Battery Manometer assembly Gas cylinder —— Plastic tube Orifice FIGURE 6.3.1(a) Water level measurement using a bubble gage recorder.

{"paragraph": "6.3 MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE WATER Water Surface Elevation Water surface elevation measurements include both peak levels (flood crest ele- vations) and the stage as a function of time. These measurements can be made manually or automatically. Crest stage gages are used to obtain a record of flood crests at sites where recording gages are not-installed. A crest stage gage consists of a wooden staff gage or scale, situated inside a pipe that has small holes for the entry of water. A small amount of cork is placed in the pipe, floats as the water rises, and adheres to the staff or scale at the highest water level. Manual observations of water level are made using staff gages, which are graduated boards set in the water surface, or by means of sounding devices that signal the level at which they reach the water surface, such as a weight on a wire suspended from a bridge over the surface of a river. Automatic records of water levels are made at about 10,000 locations in the United States; the bubble gage is the sensor most widely used [Fig. 6.3.1(a)]. A bubble gage senses the water level by bubbling a continuous stream of gas (usually carbon dioxide) into the water. The pressure required to continuously push the gas stream out beneath the water surface is a measure of the depth of the water over the nozzle of the bubble stream. This pressure is measured by a manometer in the recorder house [Fig. 6.3.1(b)]. Continuous records of water levels are maintained for the calculation of stream flow rates. The level of water in a stream at any time is referred to as the gage height. HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT 185 FIGURE 6.3.1(5) The mercury manometer used to measure the gas pressure in a water level recorder. As the water level and gas pressure change, an electric motor drives a pair of sensor wires up or down to follow the motion of the mercury surface. (Source: G. N. Mesnier, US Geological Survey, USGS Water Supp. Pap. 1669-Z, Fig. 7, 1963.) Flow Velocity The velocity of flow in a stream can be measured with a current meter. Current meters are propeller devices placed in the flow, the speed with which the propeller rotates being proportional to the flow velocity (Fig. 6.3.2). The current meter can be hand-held in the flow in a small stream, suspended from a bridge or cable-way across a larger stream, or lowered from the bow of a boat (Fig. 6.3.3). The flow velocity varies with depth in a stream as shown in Fig. 6.3.4. Figure 6.3.5 shows isovels (lines of equal velocity) for sections of the Kaskaskia River in IIlinois. The velocity rises from 0 at the bed to a maximum near the surface, with an average value occurring at about 0.6 of the depth. It is a standard practice of the U.S. Geological Survey to measure velocity at 0.2 and 0.8 of the depth when the depth is more than 2 ft and to average the two velocities to determine the average velocity for the vertical section. For shallow rivers and near the banks on deeper rivers where the depths are less than 2 ft, velocity measurements are made at 0.6 depth. On some occasions, it is desired to know the travel time of flow from one location to another some distance away, perhaps several days flow 186 APPLIED HYDROLOGY FIGURE 6.3.2 Current meters for measuring water velocity. The smaller one mounted on the base in the foreground is attached to a vertical rod and used when wading across a shallow stream. The larger one in the background is suspended on a wire and used for gaging a deeper river from a bridge or boat. Both meters work on the principle that the speed of rotation of the cups is proportional to the flow velocity. The operator attaches electrical wires to the two screws on the vertical shaft holding the cups. Each time the cups complete a rotation, a contact is closed inside the shaft and the operator hears a click in headphones to which the wires are attached. By counting the number of clicks in a fixed time interval (say 40 seconds), the velocity is determined. (Source: T. J. Buchanan, U. S. Geological Survey.

Velocity measurements can also be made based upon electromagnetic sensing. The Velocity Modified Flow Measurement (VMFM) meter is a velocity- sensing instrument based upon such principles (Marsh-McBirney, 1979). The portable meter shown in Fig. 6.3.6 has a solid state electronics system housed in a small box, an electromagnetic sensor, and connecting cable. The sensor is placed on the same rod used for propeller-type current meters and the rod is hand held for making velocity measurements. When the sensor is immersed in flowing water, a magnetic field within the sensor is altered by the water flow, creating a voltage variation which is measured by electrodes imbedded in the sensor. The amplitude of the voltage variation is proportional to the water velocity. The voltage variation is transmitted through the cable to the electronic processor sys- tem, which automatically averages point velocity measurements made at different locations in a stream cross section. The sensor also monitors water depth using a bubble gage, and the processor integrates velocity and depth measurements to produce discharge data. This meter can also be used to measure flows in sewer pipes and in other types of open channels. Stream Flow Rate Stream flow is not directly recorded, even though this variable is perhaps the most important in hydrologic studies. Instead, water level is recorded and stream flow is deduced by means of a rating curve (Riggs, 1985). The rating curve is developed using a set of measurements of discharge and gage height in the stream, these measurements being made over a period of months or years so as to obtain an accurate relationship between the stream flow rate, or discharge, and the gage height at the gaging site.

Each measurement represents the conditions up to halfway between this measurement and the adjacent measurements on either side.

The average velocity at this cross section is V= Q/A = 3061/1693 = 1.81 ft/s. There are indirect methods of measuring stream flow not requiring the use of current meters or water level records.

The rating curve is constructed by plotting successive mea- surements of the discharge and gage height on a graph such as that shown in Fig. 6.3.8. The rating curve is then used to convert records of water level into flow rates. The rating curve must be checked periodically to ensure that the relation- ship between the discharge and gage height has remained constant; scouring of the stream bed or deposition of sediment in the stream can cause the rating curve to change so that the same recorded gage height produces a different discharge. The relationship between water level and the flow rate at a given site can be maintained consistently by constructing a special flow control device in the stream, such as a sharp crested weir or a flume. 192 APPLIED HYDROLOGY", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of surface water measurement, what methods are used to measure water surface elevation?", "answer": "Water surface elevation measurements include both peak levels (flood crest elevations) and the stage as a function of time, which can be made manually or automatically using crest stage gages, staff gages, or sounding devices."}, {"question": "How do crest stage gages measure flood crests at sites without recording gages?", "answer": "Crest stage gages measure flood crests by using a wooden staff gage or scale inside a pipe with small holes for water entry, where a small amount of cork floats as the water rises and adheres to the staff or scale at the highest water level."}, {"question": "Why are automatic records of water levels made at numerous locations in the United States?", "answer": "Automatic records of water levels are made at about 10,000 locations in the United States to maintain continuous records of water levels for the calculation of stream flow rates, which is crucial for hydrologic studies.

The measurements represent average values over the width of the stream, so the discharge is computed as Q = ∑V_i d_i A_i, where V_i is the mean velocity, d_i is the depth, and A_i is the area increment."}, {"question": "How does the Velocity Modified Flow Measurement (VMFM) meter measure flow velocity, and what are its advantages?", "answer": "The VMFM meter measures flow velocity based on electromagnetic sensing principles. It has a solid-state electronics system, an electromagnetic sensor, and a connecting cable. The sensor is placed on the same rod used for propeller-type current meters, and the rod is hand-held for making velocity measurements. The VMFM meter can also measure flows in sewer pipes and other types of open channels, making it a versatile tool for hydrologic measurements."}, {"question": "What are the implications of changes in the stream bed or sediment deposition on the rating curve, and how can these changes be addressed?", "answer": "Changes in the stream bed or sediment deposition can cause the rating curve to change, resulting in inaccurate flow rate measurements. To address these changes, the rating curve must be checked periodically and updated as necessary. Constructing a special flow control device, such as a sharp-crested weir or a flume, can help maintain a consistent relationship between water level and flow rate at a given site. This is crucial for ensuring accurate hydrologic measurements and predictions."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.4 MEASUREMENT OF SUBSURFACE WATER Soil Moisture The amount of moisture in the soil can be found by taking a sample of soil and oven drying it. By comparing the weight of the sample before and after the drying and measuring the volume of the sample, the moisture content of the soil can be determined. Some recording devices which record soil moisture directly in the field have been developed, particularly for irrigation studies. These include gypsum blocks and neutron probes. Neutron probes rely on the reflection of neutrons emitted from a probe device inserted in a hole in the ground by the moisture in the surrounding soil, the degree of reflection of the neutrons being proportional to the moisture content (Shaw, 1983). Infiltration Measurements of infiltration are made using a ring infiltrometer, which is a metal ring approximately two feet in diameter that is driven into the soil; water is placed inside the ring and the level of the water is recorded at regular time intervals as it recedes. This permits the construction of the cumulative infiltration curve, and from this the infiltration rate as a function of time may be calculated. Sometimes a second ring is added outside the first, filled with water and maintained at a constant level so that the infiltration from the inner ring goes vertically down into the soil. In some cases, measurements of infiltration can be made by using tracers introduced at the surface of the soil and extracted from probes placed below the surface. Ground Water The level of water in the saturated flow or ground water zone is determinedb y means of observation wells. An observation well has a float device so that the vertical movement of water in the well is transmitted by means of a pulley system to the recorder house at the surface. Devices that drop a probe down the well on a wire to sense the water level can be used to obtain instantaneous measurements. The velocity of ground water flow can also be determined by tracers, including common salt. A quantity of the tracer is introduced at an upstream well, and the time for the pulse of tracer to reach a well somewhat downstream of the first is recorded. This is the actual velocity and not the apparent or Darcy velocity. Such measurements also assist in determining the amount of dispersion of contaminants introduced into ground water.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of soil moisture measurement, how are neutron probes used to determine moisture content?", "answer": "Neutron probes are used by emitting neutrons from a probe device inserted into a hole in the ground.

This method allows for direct measurement of soil moisture in the field, particularly useful for irrigation studies."}, {"question": "Why are ring infiltrometers used for measuring infiltration, and what information can be derived from their use?", "answer": "Ring infiltrometers are used for measuring infiltration because they allow for the controlled introduction of water into the soil, enabling the measurement of how quickly water infiltrates the soil over time. By recording the level of water inside the ring at regular intervals as it recedes, a cumulative infiltration curve can be constructed. From this curve, the infiltration rate as a function of time can be calculated, providing valuable insights into the soil's infiltration characteristics."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, how is the velocity of groundwater flow determined using tracers?", "answer": "The velocity of groundwater flow is determined by introducing a quantity of tracer, such as common salt, at an upstream well and recording the time it takes for the pulse of tracer to reach a well downstream. This method provides the actual velocity of groundwater flow, as opposed to the apparent or Darcy velocity. The use of tracers in this manner not only helps in determining the velocity but also assists in understanding the dispersion of contaminants introduced into groundwater, which is crucial for managing groundwater resources and mitigating pollution."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of using a second ring in infiltration measurements, and how does it enhance the measurement process?", "answer": "The purpose of using a second ring outside the first in infiltration measurements is to maintain a constant water level, ensuring that the infiltration from the inner ring goes vertically down into the soil. This setup enhances the measurement process by providing a more controlled environment, allowing for more accurate calculations of the infiltration rate and better understanding of the soil's infiltration properties."}, {"question": "In the context of soil moisture measurement, why is oven drying a sample of soil used as a method to determine moisture content?", "answer": "Oven drying a sample of soil is used to determine moisture content because it allows for the direct measurement of the weight loss due to moisture evaporation. By comparing the weight of the sample before and after drying and knowing the volume of the sample, the moisture content can be accurately determined. This method serves as a baseline for other measurement techniques, providing a direct and reliable way to quantify soil moisture."}, {"question": "How do observation wells contribute to the understanding of groundwater levels and flow?", "answer": "Observation wells contribute to the understanding of groundwater levels by allowing for the measurement of the water level in the saturated flow or ground water zone. Through the use of a float device and a pulley system, the vertical movement of water in the well is transmitted to a recorder at the surface, providing continuous data on groundwater levels. Additionally, devices that drop a probe down the well can be used for instantaneous measurements, offering flexibility in monitoring groundwater levels and flow."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using tracers in groundwater for understanding contaminant dispersion?", "answer": "The use of tracers in groundwater has significant implications for understanding contaminant dispersion. By introducing a tracer and measuring the time it takes to reach a downstream well, not only can the velocity of groundwater flow be determined, but also the degree of dispersion of contaminants can be assessed. This information is critical for predicting the movement and spread of pollutants in groundwater, which is essential for designing effective remediation strategies and protecting groundwater resources."}, {"question": "In the context of infiltration measurements, what is the role of cumulative infiltration curves, and how are they constructed?", "answer": "Cumulative infiltration curves play a crucial role in infiltration measurements as they provide a graphical representation of the total amount of water infiltrated into the soil over time. These curves are constructed by plotting the cumulative infiltration against time, using data collected from ring infiltrometer experiments where the water level inside the ring is recorded at regular intervals. The curve allows for the calculation of the infiltration rate as a function of time, offering insights into the soil's infiltration capacity and characteristics."}, {"question": "Why are gypsum blocks used in soil moisture measurement, and what advantages do they offer?", "answer": "Gypsum blocks are used in soil moisture measurement because they can record soil moisture directly in the field.

{"paragraph": "6.5 HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS _ Urban Hydrology Monitoring Systems Urban stormwater investigations require well-designed data collection systems and instrumentation, both for water quantity and water quality. Besides conventional HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT 193 stream gaging and precipitation measurement, elaborate instruments employing microprocessor technology are used to collect and record information at remote locations such as in underground storm drains. An instrumentation package called an urban hydrology monitoring system, as used by the U. S. Geological Survey for urban stormwater investigations, is shown in Fig. 6.5.1 (Jennings, 1982). This system is designed to collect storm rainfall and runoff quantity and quality data. It was specifically designed for flow gaging in underground storm sewers using a flow constriction as the discharge control. The system is composed of five components: the system control unit, rain gages, atmospheric sampling, stage sensing, and water quality sampling. The system control unit is a microprocessor that records data at a central site, controls an automatic water-sampling device, records rain gage readings via telephone lines, and continuously monitors the stage in the storm sewers.

Geological Survey urban hydrology monitoring system (Source: Jennings, 1982. Used with permission.) 194 APPLIED HYDROLOGY control unit operates in a standby mode between storms, so that data are collected only if there is rainfall. The rain gage has an 8-in diameter orifice and a tipping bucket mechanism coupled to a mercury switch. The buckets are calibrated to tip after each 0.01 in of rainfall. The atmospheric sampler is used to collect samples of atmospheric con- stituents affecting water quality, as for acid rain studies. Two rectangular collec- tors are used, one for sampling rainfall and the other for dry deposition of dust and other constituents between rainfalls. Water quality samples are also taken from storm sewers using automatic pump samplers. The samples are stored in a freezer which maintains the water temperature at approximately 5°C. Real-time Data Collection Systems for River-Lake Systems Real-time data collection and transmission can be used for flood forecasting on large river-lake systems covering thousands of square miles, as shown in Fig. 6.5.2 for the lower Colorado River in central Texas. The data collection sys- tem used there is called a Hydrometeorological Data Acquisition System (Hy- dromet, EG&G Washington Analytical Services Center, Inc., 1981) and is used to provide information for a flood forecasting model (Section 15.5). This infor- mation is of two types: (a) the water surface elevations at various locations throughout the river-lake system, and (b) rainfall from a rain gage network for the ungaged drainage areas around the lakes. The Hydromet system consists of (a) remote terminal unit (RTU) hydrometeorological data acquisition stations installed at U.S. Geological Survey river gage sites, (b) microwave terminal unit (MTU) microwave-to-UHF radio interface units located at microwave repeater sites, which convert radio signals to microwave signals, and (c) a central control station located at the operations control center in Austin, Texas, which receives its information from the microwave repeating stations. The system is designed to automatically acquire river level and meteorological data from each RTU; telemeter this data on request to the central station via the UHF/microwave radio system; determine the flow rate at each site by using rating tables stored in the central system memory; format and output the data for each site; and maintain a historical file of data for each site which may be accessed by the local operator, a computer, or a remote dial-up telephone line terminal. The system also functions as a self-reporting flood alarm network. Flood Early Warning System for Urban Areas Because of the potential for severe flash flooding and consequent loss of life in many urban areas throughout the world, flood early warning systems have been constructed and implemented. Flood early warning systems (Fig. 6.5.3) are real-time event reporting systems that consist of remote gaging sites with radio repeater sites to transmit information to a base station. The overall system is used to collect, transport, and analyze data, and make a flood forecast in order to maximize the warning time to occupants in the flood plain.

The remote stations (Fig. 6.5.4) each have a tipping bucket rain gage, which generates a digital input to a transmitter whenever 1 mm of rainfall drains through the funnel assembly. A transmission to the base station is made for each tip of the bucket. The rain gage is completely self-contained, consisting of a cylindrical stand pipe housing for the rain gage, antenna mount, battery, and electronics. Some remote stations have both rainfall and streamflow gages. The remote stations can include a stilling well or a pressure transducer water level sensor similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 6.5.5. The pressure transducer measures changes of the water level above the pressure sensor’s orifice. The electronic differential pressure transducer automatically compensates for temperature and barometric pressure changes with a one percent accuracy over the measured range.

{"paragraph": "6.6 MEASUREMENT OF PHYSIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS In hydrologic studies in which gaged data are sometimes not available, for exam- ple in rainfall-runoff analysis, runoff characteristics are estimated from phys- iographic characteristics. Watershed physiographic information can be obtained from maps describing land use, soils maps, geologic maps, topographic maps, and aerial photography.

By distinguishing between total and effective impervious areas, hydrologists can more accurately estimate runoff characteristics and model the hydrologic behavior of urban watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of soil characteristics, what is the significance of permeability of the A horizon of the soil profile?", "answer": "The permeability of the A horizon of the soil profile is significant because it influences the infiltration capacity of the soil, affecting the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff versus groundwater recharge. Higher permeability values indicate that more rainfall can infiltrate the soil, reducing runoff and increasing groundwater recharge, whereas lower permeability values result in more runoff and less recharge."}, {"question": "How do land use patterns, such as rural, agricultural, and residential areas, impact hydrologic processes in urban watersheds?", "answer": "Land use patterns significantly impact hydrologic processes by altering the amount of impervious surface area, soil permeability, and runoff generation. For example, urban areas with high-density residential and commercial development tend to have more impervious surfaces, leading to increased runoff and reduced infiltration. In contrast, rural and agricultural areas often have more permeable surfaces, resulting in less runoff and more groundwater recharge. Understanding these relationships is essential for managing urban watersheds and mitigating the effects of urbanization on hydrologic processes."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of compiling a list of physiographic characteristics, such as the 22 factors listed, in hydrologic studies?", "answer": "The purpose of compiling a list of physiographic characteristics is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the watershed's physical properties and how they influence hydrologic processes.

CHAPTER = UNIT HYDROGRAPH In the previous chapters of this book, the physical laws governing the operation of hydrologic systems have been described and working equations developed to determine the flow in atmospheric, subsurface, and surface water systems. The Reynolds transport theorem applied to a control volume provided the mathematical means for consistently expressing the various applicable physical laws. It may be remembered that the control volume principle does not call for a description of the internal dynamics of flow within the control volume; all that is required is knowledge of the inputs and outputs to the control volume and the physical laws regulating their interaction. In Chap. 1, a tree classification was presented (Fig. 1.4.1), distinguishing the various types of models of hydrologic systems according to the way each deals with the randomness and the space and time variability of the hydrologic processes involved. Up to this point in the book, most of the working equations developed have been for the simplest type of model shown in this diagram, namely a deterministic (no randomness) lumped (one point in space) steady-flow model (flow does not change with time). This chapter takes up the subject of deterministic lumped unsteady flow models; subsequent chapters (8-12) cover a range of models in the classification tree from left to right. Where possible, use is made of knowledge of the governing physical laws of the system. In addition to this, methods drawn from other fields of study such as linear systems analysis, optimization, and applied statistics are employed to analyze the input and output variables of hydrologic systems. In the development of these models, the concept of control volume remains as it was introduced in Chap. 1: “A volume or structure in space, surrounded by a boundary, which accepts water and other inputs, operates on them internally and produces them as outputs.” In this chapter, the interaction between rainfall 201 202 APPLIED HYDROLOGY and runoff on a watershed is analyzed by viewing the watershed as a lumped linear system.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the Colorado River at Austin, what is the significance of the bed slope in determining Manning's n for discharge calculations?", "answer": "The bed slope is crucial as it influences the flow characteristics, and a value of 0.03 percent is given for the Colorado River at Austin.

These models are still lumped, meaning they consider the system at a single point in space, and deterministic, meaning they do not account for randomness."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of analyzing the interaction between rainfall and runoff on a watershed in the context of hydrologic modeling?", "answer": "Analyzing the interaction between rainfall and runoff on a watershed is crucial for understanding how watersheds respond to precipitation events. By viewing the watershed as a lumped linear system, hydrologists can develop models that predict runoff based on rainfall inputs. This understanding is essential for flood prediction, water resource management, and environmental planning."}, {"question": "In the context of discharge measurements, why is it necessary to calculate the percent difference between the discharge given by the rating curve and the measured discharge?", "answer": "Calculating the percent difference between the discharge given by the rating curve and the measured discharge is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the rating curve.

{"paragraph": "7.1 GENERAL HYDROLOGIC SYSTEM MODEL The amount of water stored in a hydrologic system, S may be related to the rates of inflow J and outflow Q by the integral equation of continuity (2.2.4): = =e 0 Gute) Imagine that the water is stored in a hydrologic system, such as a reservoir (Fig. 7.1.1), in which the amount of storage rises and falls with time in response to J and Q and their rates of change with respect to time: di/dt, d7I/dt*,..., dQ/dt,d’Q/dt?, ... . Thus, the amount of storage at any time can be expressed by a storage function as: 2 2 5 ee Grtzg Ss 973 (wie) The function f is determined by the nature of the hydrologic system being examined. For example, the linear reservoir introduced in Chap. 5 as a model for baseflow in streams relates storage and outflow by S = kQ, where k is a constant. The continuity equation (7.1.1) and the storage function equation (7.1.2) must be solved simultaneously so that the output Q can be calculated given the input /, where J and Q are both functions of time. This can be done in two ways: by differentiating the storage function and substituting the result for dS/dt in (7.1.1), then solving the resulting differential equation in / and Q by integration; or by applying the finite difference method directly to Eqs. (7.1.1) and (7.1.2) to solve them recursively at discrete points in time. In this chapter, the first, or integral, approach is taken, and in Chap. 8, the second, or differential, approach is adopted.

Equation (7.1.4) was presented by Chow and Kulandaiswamy (1971) as a general hydrologic system model. It describes a lumped system because it contains derivatives with respect to time alone and not spatial dimensions. Chow and Kulandaiswamy showed that many of the previously proposed models of lumped hydrologic systems were special cases of this general model.

By solving the continuity equation and the storage function equation simultaneously, the output Q can be determined as a function of time, given that both J and Q are functions of time.

It shows that many previously proposed models are special cases of this general model, thereby unifying the approach to modeling such systems.

The integral approach involves differentiating the storage function and substituting the result into the continuity equation to solve for Q, whereas the differential approach applies the finite difference method directly to the continuity and storage function equations to solve them recursively at discrete points in time. The choice between these methods depends on the specific characteristics of the system being modeled and the desired level of complexity in the solution."}, {"question": "Why is linearity in hydrologic systems significant, and what does it imply about the system's behavior over time?", "answer": "Linearity in hydrologic systems is significant because it implies that the system is time-invariant, meaning its response to input does not change over time. This linearity simplifies the analysis and prediction of the system's behavior, as the system's response to any input can be determined by its response to a unit impulse input. However, real hydrologic systems often exhibit nonlinear behavior, which can complicate modeling and prediction efforts."}, {"question": "How does the concept of time-invariance in linear hydrologic systems affect their modeling and analysis?", "answer": "The concept of time-invariance in linear hydrologic systems means that the system's response to input does not change over time.

{"paragraph": "7.2 RESPONSE FUNCTIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS The solution of (7.1.6) for the transfer function of hydrologic systems follows two basic principles for linear system operations which are derived from methods for solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients (Kreyszig, 1968): 1. If a solution f(Q) is multiplied by a constant c, the resulting function cf(Q) is also a solution (principle of proportionality). 2. If two solutions f;(Q) and f2(Q) of the equation are added, the resulting function f;(Q) + f2(Q) is also a solution of the equation (principle of additivity or superposition). The particular solution adopted depends on the input function N(D)I, and on the specified initial conditions or values of the output variables at t = 0. Impulse Response Function The response of a linear system is uniquely characterized by its impulse response function. If a system receives an input of unit amount applied instantaneously (a unit impulse) at time 7, the response of the system at a later time f is described by the unit impulse response function u(t — 7); f— 7 1s the time lag since the impulse was applied [Fig. 7.2.1(a)]. The response of a guitar string when it is plucked is one example of a response to an impulse; another is the response of the shock absorber in a car after the wheel passes over a pothole. If the storage reservoir in Fig. 7.1.1 is initially empty, and then the reservoir is instantaneously filled with a unit amount of water, the resulting outflow function Q(t) is the impulse response function. Following the two principles of linear system operation cited above, if two impulses are applied, one of 3 units at time 7, and the other of 2 units at time T2, the response of the system will be 3u(t — 7) + 2u(t- 72), as shown in Fig. 7.2.1(b). Analogously, continuous input can be treated as a sum of infinitesimal impulses. The amount of input entering the system between times 7 and t + dt is I(r) dr. For example, if /(7) is the precipitation intensity in inches per hour and dv is an infinitesimal time interval measured in hours, then /(r) dt is the depth in inches of precipitation input to the system during this interval. The direct runoff t— 7 time units later resulting from this input is /(7)u(t— r)dr. The response to the complete input time function /(7) can then be found by integrating the response to its constituent impulses: t Q(t) = [nome = Tids (7.2.1) This expression, called the convolution integral, is the fundamental equation for solution of a linear system on a continuous time scale. Figure 7.2.2 illustrates the response summation process for the convolution integral. For most hydrologic applications, solutions are needed at discrete intervals of time, because the input is specified as a discrete time function, such as an UNIT HYDROGRAPH 205 I(t), Q(t) Unit impulse ur) 1 Impulse response function > I(t), Q(t) ¢ FIGURE 7.2.1 Responses of a linear system to impulse inputs.

To handle such input, two further functions are need- ed, the unit step response function and the unit pulse response function, as shown in Fig. 7.2.3. Step Response Function A unit step input is an input that goes from a rate of 0 to | at time 0 and continues indefinitely at that rate thereafter [Fig. 7.2.3(b)].

In words, the value of the unit step response function g(t) at time ¢ equals the integral of the impulse response function up to that time, as shown in Fig. 7.2.3(a) and (b). Pulse Response Function A unit pulse input is an input of unit amount occurring in duration At. The rate is (7) = 1/At, 0 = 7 S At, and zero elsewhere. The unit pulse response function produced by this input can be found by the two linear system principles cited earlier. First, by the principle of proportionality, the response to a unit step input of rate 1/Ar beginning at time 0 is (1/Ar)g(t). If a similar unit step input began at time Ar instead of at 0, its response function would be lagged by time interval At, and would have a value at time rt equal to (1/An)g(t — At). Then, using the principle of superposition, the response to a unit pulse input duration Ar is found by subtracting the response to a step input of rate 1/Ar beginning at time Ar from UNIT HYDROGRAPH 207 lim A(t) = u(t) Ar+o0 (da) Discrete pulse (a) Impulse response, u(t) response, U,, _slAjlaw Input — Unniitt Input U, u(t) eo Output U, pote u(t) AS Time 0) .

Now let the time domain be broken into discrete intervals of duration At. As shown in Sec. 2.3, there are two ways to represent a continuous time function on a discrete time domain, as a pulse data system or as a sample data system. The pulse data system is used for precipitation and the value of its discrete input function for the mth time interval is At ‘ Pm = iN I(r) dt His) Ao. ooh ie220) (m—1)A t P,, is the depth of precipitation falling during the time interval (in inches or centimeters).

Thus the input and output variables to a watershed system are recorded with different dimensions and using different discrete data representations. The effect of an input pulse of duration Ar beginning at time (m — 1)At on the output at time t = nAt is measured by the value of the unit pulse response function A[t — (m — 1)At] = h[nAt — (m — 1)At] = A[(n — m + 1)Aq), given, following Eq.

I(r) = 0 for 7 > MAt. Consider the case where the output is being calculated after all the input has ceased, that is, at t = nAt > MAt [see Fig. 7.2.2(b)]. The contribution to the output of each of the M input pulses can be found by breaking the convolution integral (7.2.1) at t = nAt into M parts: At OF -| I(r)u(nAt — r)dt P At P At 1 2 =—f e I u(n Are T) yard T + Paalle i u(nAt =— tT) dt + et (7.2.9) At MAt Pin Pau “f= nAt— tT)dtT+...+ — aa At J(m—1)at i por At J(M—1)ar meea e cne where. the terms P,,/At, m= 1,2,..., M, can be brought outside the integrals because they are constants.

{"paragraph": "7.3 THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH The unit hydrograph is the unit pulse response function of a linear hydrologic system. First proposed by Sherman (1932), the unit hydrograph (originally named unit-graph) of a watershed is defined as a direct runoff hydrograph (DRH) result- ing from 1 in (usually taken as 1 cm in SI units) of excess rainfall generated 214 APPLIED HYDROLOGY uniformly over the drainage area at a constant rate for an effective duration. Sherman originally used the word “unit” to denote a unit of time, but since that time it has often been interpreted as a unit depth of excess rainfall. Sherman classified runoff into surface runoff and groundwater runoff and defined the unit hydrograph for use only with surface runoff. Methods of calculating excess rainfall and direct runoff from observed rainfall and streamflow data are presented in Chap. 5. The unit hydrograph is a simple linear model that can be used to derive the hydrograph resulting from any amount of excess rainfall. The following basic assumptions are inherent in this model: 1, The excess rainfall has a constant intensity within the effective duration. 2. The excess rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the whole drainage area. 3. The base time of the DRH (the duration of direct runoff) resulting from an excess rainfall of given duration is constant. 4. The ordinates of all DRH’s of a common base time are directly proportional to the total amount of direct runoff represented by each hydrograph. 5. For a given watershed, the hydrograph resulting from a given excess rainfall reflects the unchanging characteristics of the watershed. Under natural conditions, the above assumptions cannot be perfectly satisfied. However, when the hydrologic data to be used are carefully selected so that they come close to meeting the above assumptions, the results obtained by the unit hydrograph model are generally acceptable for practical purposes (Heerde- gen, 1974). Although the model was originally devised for large watersheds, it has been found applicable to small watersheds from less than 0.5 hectares to 25 km? (about 1 acre to 10 mi”). Some cases do not support the use of the model because one or more of the assumptions are not well satisfied. For such reasons, the model is considered inapplicable to runoff originating from snow or ice. Concerning assumption (1), the storms selected for analysis should be of short duration, since these will most likely produce an intense and nearly constant excess rainfall rate, yielding a well-defined single-peaked hydrograph of short time base. Concerning assumption (2), the unit hydrograph may become inapplicable when the drainage area is too large to be covered by a nearly uniform distribution of rainfall. In such cases, the area has to be divided and each subarea analyzed for storms covering the whole subarea. Concerning assumption (3), the base time of the direct runoff hydrograph (DRH) is generally uncertain but depends on the method of baseflow separation (see Sec. 5.2). The base time is usually short if the direct runoff is considered to include the surface runoff only; it is long if the direct runoff also includes subsurface runoff. Concerning assumption (4), the principles of superposition and proportion- ality are assumed so that the ordinates Q,, of the DRH may be computed by Eq.

This is the principle of time invariance, which, together with the principles of superposition and proportionality, is fundamental to the unit hydrograph model. Unit hydrographs are applicable only when channel conditions remain unchanged and watersheds do not have appreciable storage. This condition is violated when the drainage area contains many reservoirs, or when the flood overflows into the flood plain, thereby producing considerable storage.

Solutions may be similarly obtained by focusing on other rainfall pulses. The depth of direct runoff in the unit hydrograph can be checked and found to equal 1.00 inch as required. In cases where the derived unit hydrograph does not meet this requirement, the ordinates are adjusted by proportion so that the depth of direct runoff is 1 inch (or 1 cm). In general the unit hydrographs obtained by solutions of the set of equations in Table 7.4.1 for different rainfall pulses are not identical. To obtain a unique solution a method of successive approximation (Collins, 1939) can be used, which involves four steps: (1) assume a unit hydrograph, and apply it to all excess- rainfall blocks of the hyetograph except the largest; (2) subtract the resulting hydrograph from the actual DRH, and reduce the residual to unit hydrograph terms; (3) compute a weighted average of the assumed unit hydrograph and the residual unit hydrograph, and use it as the revised approximation for the next trial; (4) repeat the previous three steps until the residual unit hydrograph does not differ by more than a permissible amount from the assumed hydrograph. The resulting unit hydrograph may show erratic variations and even have negative values. If this occurs, a smooth curve may be fitted to the ordinates to produce an approximation of the unit hydrograph. Erratic variation in the unit hydrograph may be due to nonlinearity in the effective rainfall—direct runoff relationship in the watershed, and even if this relationship is truly linear, the observed data may not adequately reflect this.

This ensures that the convolution process accurately represents the runoff response of the watershed.

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the time intervals are consistent when applying the unit hydrograph to calculate the direct runoff hydrograph."}]}

A solution is sought which minimizes the error [Ol = [Q] between the observed and estimated DRH’s. Solution by Linear Regression The solution by linear regression produces the least-squares error between [Q] and [OQ] (Snyder, 1955). To solve Eq. (7.6.2) for [U], the rectangular matrix [P]: 222 APPLIED HYDROLOGY is reduced to a square matrix [Z] by multiplying both sides by the transpose of [P], denoted by [P]’, which is formed by interchanging the rows and columns of [P]. Then both sides are multiplied by the inverse [Z] ~! of matrix [Z], to yield (UL= (2) Jee} (7.6.4) where [Z] = [P]’[P]. However, the solution is not easy to determine by this method, because the many repeated and blank entries in [P] create difficulties in the inversion of [Z] (Bree, 1978). Newton and Vinyard (1967) and Singh (1976) give alternative methods of obtaining the least-squares solution, but these methods do not ensure that all the unit hydrograph ordinates will be nonnegative. Selution by Linear Programming Linear programming is an alternative method of solving for [U] in Eq. (7.6.2) that minimizes the absolute value of the error between [Q] and [OQ] and also ensures that all entries of [U] are nonnegative (Eagleson, Mejia, and March, 1966; Deininger, 1969; Singh, 1976; Mays and Coles, 1980). The general linear programming model is stated in the form of a linear objective function to be optimized (maximized or minimized) subject to linear constraint equations. Linear programming provides a method of comparing all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints and obtaining the one that optimizes the objective function (Hillier and Lieberman, 1974; Bradley, Hax, and Magnanti, 1977). graph given the ERH P,,,m = 1,2,...,M, and the DRH Q,,n = 1,2,...,N.

Linear programming requires all the decision variables to be non-negative, thereby ensuring the unit hydrograph ordinates will be non-negative.

Several ERHs and their resulting DRHs can be linked together as if they comprised one event and used to find a com- posite unit hydrograph best representing the response of the watershed to this set of storms. Multistorm analysis may also be carried out using the least-squares method (Diskin and Boneh, 1975; Mawdsley and Tagg, 1981). In determination of the unit hydrograph from complex hydrographs, the abstractions are a significant source of error—although often assumed constant, the loss rate is actually a time-varying function whose value is affected by the moisture content of the watershed prior to the storm and by the storm pattern itself. Different unit hydrographs result from different assumptions about the pattern of losses. Newton and Vinyard (1967) account for errors in the loss rate by iteratively adjusting the ordinates of the ERH as well as those of the unit hydrograph so as to minimize the error in the DRH. Mays and Taur (1982) used nonlinear programming to simultaneously determine the loss rate for each storm period and the composite unit hydrograph ordinates for a multistorm event.

{"paragraph": "7.7 SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH The unit hydrograph developed from rainfall and streamflow data on a watershed applies only for that watershed and for the point on the stream where the 224 APPLIED HYDROLOGY streamflow data were measured. Synthetic unit hydrograph procedures are used to develop unit hydrographs for other locations on the stream in the same watershed or for nearby watersheds of a similar character. There are three types of synthetic unit hydrographs: (1) those relating hydrograph characteristics (peak flow rate, base time, etc.) to watershed characteristics (Snyder, 1938; Gray, 1961), (2) those based on a dimensionless unit hydrograph (Soil Conservation Service, 1972), and (3) those based on models of watershed storage (Clark, 1943). Types (1) and (2) are described here and type (3) in Chap. 8. Snyder’s Synthetic Unit Hydrograph In a study of watersheds located mainly in the Appalachian highlands of the United States, and varying in size from about 10 to 10,000 mi? (30 to 30,000 km’), Snyder (1938) found synthetic relations for some characteristics of a standard unit hydrograph [Fig. 7.7.1a]. Additional such relations were found later (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1959). These relations, in modified form are given below. From the relations, five characteristics of a required unit hydrograph [Fig. 7.7.1b] for a given excess rainfall duration may be calculated: the peak discharge per unit of watershed area, qpr, the basin lag tyr (time difference between the centroid of the excess rainfall hyetograph and the unit hydrograph peak), the base time ¢,, and the widths W (in time units) of the unit hydrograph at 5O and 75 percent of the peak discharge. Using these characteristics the required unit hydrograph may be drawn. The variables are illustrated in Fig. 7.7.1. Snyder defined a standard unit hydrograph as one whose rainfall duration t, is related to the basin lag t, by tp = 5.5t, GE Fel) For a standard unit hydrograph he found that: >| ee !, 3 3 2 } M tp = & 4, si 2 <: 2= § Zs Time Time (a) (b) FIGURE 7.7.1 Snyder’s synthetic unit hydrograph.

(7.7.2) where f, is in hours, L is the length of the main stream in kilometers (or miles) from the outlet to the upstream divide, L, is the distance in kilometers (miles) from the outlet to a point on the stream nearest the centroid of the watershed area, C; = 0.75 (1.0 for the English system), and C, is a coefficient derived from gaged watersheds in the same region. 2. The peak discharge per unit drainage area in m°/s-km2 (cfs/mi2) of the standard unit hydrograph is 2k (7.7.3) where C2 = 2.75 (640 for the English system) and C, is a coefficient derived from gaged watersheds in the same region. To compute C, and C, for a gaged watershed, the values of L and L, are measured from the basin map. From a derived unit hydrograph of the watershed are obtained values of its effective duration tr in hours, its basin lag tp in hours, and its peak discharge per unit drainage area, qpp, in m?/s:km?-cm (cfs/mi?-in for the English system). If tpr = 5.5tr, then tp = tr, tpR = tp, and Gpr = gp, and C, and C, are computed by Eqs. (7.7.2) and (7.7.3). If tpr is quite different from 5.5tp, the standard basin lag is tromueR tp = tor + (7.7.4) 4 and Eqs. (7.7.1) and (7.7.4) are solved simultaneously for t, and tp. The values of C, and C, are then computed from (7.7.2) and (7.7.3) with qpr = 9p and tyr = tp. When an ungaged watershed appears to be similar to a gaged watershed, the coefficients C, and C, for the gaged watershed can be used in the above equations to derive the required synthetic unit hydrograph for the ungaged watershed. 3. The relationship between q, and the peak discharge per unit drainage area qpr of the required unit hydrograph is Iplp (7.7.5) QpR = oR 4. The base time ¢, in hours of the unit hydrograph can be determined using the fact that the area under the unit hydrograph is equivalent to a direct runoff of 1 cm (1 inch in the English system). Assuming a triangular shape for the unit hydrograph, the base time may be estimated by th = — (7.7.6) where C3 = 5.56 (1290 for the English system). 226 APPLIED HYDROLOGY 5.

Usually one-third of this width is distributed before the unit hydrograph peak time and two-thirds after the peak. are measured: L = 150 km, L, = 75 km, and drainage area = 3500 km?. From the unit hydrograph derived for the watershed, the following are determined: tr = 12 h, tor = 34h, and peak discharge = 157.5 m?/s:cm. Determine the coefficients C , and C, for the synthetic unit hydrograph of the watershed. Solution. From the given data, 5.5tg = 66h, which is quite different from tyr (34 h). Equation (7.7.4) yields (Te ie8) Solving (7.7.1) and (7.7.8) simultaneously gives t, = 5.9 h and t, = 32.5 h. To calculate C,, use (7.7.2): ij =C GULLS = 32.5=0.75C,(150 x 75)°° C,=2.65 The peak discharge per unit area is qpr = 157.5/3500 = U.045 m7/s‘kmcm. The coefficient C, is calculated by Eq.

Solution. The values C, = 2.64 and C, = 0.56 determined in Example 7.7.1 can also be used for this watershed. Thus, Eq. (7.7.2) gives t, = 0.75 X 2.64 x (100 x 50)°3 = 25.5 h, and (7.7.1) gives t, = 25.5/5.5 = 4.64 h. For a six-hour unit hydrograph, tg = 6 h, and Eq. (7.7.4) gives ER = bp (Ep tra = 2555 = (4.64—6)/4 = 25.8 h.

The widths of the unit hydrograph are given by Eq. (7.7.7). At 75 percent of peak discharge, W = 1.22q 5,8 = 1.22 x 0.0597-'-°8 = 25.6 h. A similar computation gives a W = 44.9 h at 50 percent of peak. The base time, given by Eq. (7.7.6), is t, = 5.56/qpr = 5.56/0.0597 = 93h. The hydrograph is drawn, as in Fig. 7.7.2, and checked to ensure that it represents a depth of direct runoff of 1 cm. A further innovation in the use of Snyder’s method has been the regionaliza- tion of unit hydrograph parameters. Espey, Altman and Graves (1977) developed a set of generalized equations for the construction of 10-minute unit hydrographs using a study of 41 watersheds ranging in size from 0.014 to 15 mi’, and in impervious percentage from 2 to 100 percent.

However, it may not fully capture the complexities of real-world hydrological processes, potentially leading to inaccuracies in predictions, especially in catchments with unique geomorphological features or complex rainfall-runoff relationships. The triangular unit hydrograph is based on simplifying assumptions about the shape of the hydrograph, which might not always reflect the actual hydrological behavior of the catchment.

{"paragraph": "7.8 UNIT HYDROGRAPHS FOR DIFFERENT RAINFALL DURATIONS When a unit hydrograph of a given excess-rainfall duration is available, the unit hydrographs of other durations can be derived. If other durations are integral multiples of the given duration, the new unit hydrograph can be easily computed by application of the principles of superposition and proportionality. However, a general method of derivation applicable to unit hydrographs of any required duration may be used on the basis of the principle of superposition. This is the S-hydrograph method. The theoretical S-hydrograph is that resulting from a continuous excess rainfall at a constant rate of | cm/h (or 1 in/h) for an indefinite period. This is the unit step response function of a watershed system. The curve assumes a deformed S shape and its ordinates ultimately approach the rate of excess rainfall at a time of equilibrium. This step response function g(t) can be derived from the unit pulse response function A(t) of the unit hydrograph, as follows. From Eq. (7.2.4), the response at time ¢ to a unit pulse of duration Ar beginning at time 0 is 1 h(t) = ays —g(t — At)] (7.8.1) Similarly, the response at time ¢ to a unit pulse beginning at time At is equal to h(t — At), that is, h(t) lagged by At time units: 1 A(t — At) = Z [a(t — At) - g(t - 240) (78.2) and the response at time ¢ to a third unit pulse beginning at time 2Ar is 1 h@'— 2An) = Als =\"2At) >e(t — 3'At)] (7.8.3) Continuing this process indefinitely, summing the resulting equations, and rearranging, yields the unit step response function, or S-hydrograph, as shown in Fig. 7.8.1(a): g(t) = At[h(t) + A(t — At) + h(t -— 2A +...)

Theoretically, the S-hydrograph so derived should be a smooth curve, because the input excess rainfall is assumed to be at a constant, continuous rate. However, the summation process will result in an undulatory form if there are errors in the rainfall abstractions or baseflow separation, or if the actual duration of excess rainfall is not the derived duration for the unit hydrograph. A dura- tion which produces minimum undulation can be found by trial. Undulation of the curve may be also caused by nonuniform temporal and areal distribution of 232 APPLIED HYDROLOGY rainfall; furthermore, when the natural data are not linear, the resulting unstable system oscillations may produce negative ordinates. In such cases, an optimization technique may be used to obtain a smoother unit hydrograph. After the S-hydrograph is constructed, the unit hydrograph of a given duration can be derived as follows: Advance, or offset, the position of the S- hydrograph by a period equal to the desired duration Ar’ and call this S-hydrograph an offset S-hydrograph, g'(t) [Fig. 7.8.1(b)], defined by g(t) = g(t — At’) (7.8.5) The difference between the ordinates of the original S-hydrograph and the offset S-hydrograph, divided by Ar’, gives the desired unit hydrograph [Fig. 7.8.1(c)]: 1 h(t) = ay BO — Be At’)] (7.8.6) 7.4.1) to produce the S-hydrograph and the 1.5-h unit hydrograph for this watershed. Solution. The 0.5-h unit hydrograph is shown in column 2 of Table 7.8.1. The S- hydrograph is found using (7.8.4) with At = 0.5 h. For t= 0.5 h, g(t) = Ath(t) = 0.5404 = 202 cfs; for t= 1h, g(t) = At{h(t) + h(t—0.5)] =0.5 x (1079 + 404) = 742 cfs; for t= 1.5 h, g(t) = At[h(t) + h(t—0.5) + A(t— 1.0)] = 0.5 x (2343 + 1079 + 404) = 1913 cfs; and so on, as shown in column 3 of Table 7.8.1. The S-hydrograph is offset by Ar’ = 1.5 h (column 4) to give g(t — At’), and the difference divided by A?’ to give the 1.5-h unit hydrograph h’(t) (column 5). For example, for t = 2. h, A(t) = (3166 — 202)/1.5 = 1976 cfs.

For an IUH, the excess rainfall is applied to the drainage area in zero time. Of course, this is only a theoretical concept and cannot be realized in actual watersheds, but it is useful because the [UH characterizes the watershed’s response to rainfall without reference to the rain- fall duration. Therefore, the IUH can be related to watershed geomorphology (Rodriguez-Iturbe and Valdes, 1979; Gupta, Waymire, and Wang, 1980). The convolution integral (7.2.1) is Of). = [me — t)l(1) dt (7.8.7) If the quantities /(7) and Q(t) have the same dimensions, the ordinate of the IUH must have dimensions [T~!]. The properties of the IUH are as follows, with hat 0 = u(l)S some positive peak value for! >0 u(l) =0 for] =0 u(l)— 0 as |>] (7.8.8) io dl=1 and [uae = ty 0 0 The quantity t, is the lag time of the IUH. It can be shown that t; gives the time interval between the centroid of an excess rainfall hyetograph and that of the corresponding direct runoff hydrograph. Note the difference between t, and the variable ¢, used for synthetic unit hydrograph lag time—r, measures the time from the centroid of the excess rainfall to the peak, not the centroid, of the direct runoff hydrograph. The ideal shape of an IUH as described above resembles that of a single-peaked direct-runoff hydrograph, however, an IUH can have negative and undulating ordinates. There are several methods to determine an IUH from a given ERH and DRH. For an approximation, the IUH ordinate at time f is simply set equal to the slope at time t of an S-hydrograph constructed for an excess rainfall intensity of unit depth per unit time. This procedure is based on the fact that the S-hydrograph is an integral curve of the IUH; that is, its ordinate at time f is equal to the integral of the area under the IUH from 0 to t. The IUH so obtained is in general only an approximation because the slope of an S-hydrograph is difficult to measure accurately. The IUH can be determined by various methods of mathematical inversion, using, for example, orthogonal functions such as Fourier series (O’Donnell, 1960) or Laguerre functions (Dooge, 1973); integral transforms such as the Laplace transform (Chow, 1964), the Fourier transform (Blank, Delleur, and Giorgini, 234 APPLIED HYDROLOGY 1971), and the Z transform (Bree, 1978); and mathematical modeling related to watershed geomorphology (Sec. 8.5).

CHAPTER 8 LUMPED FLOW ROUTING Flow routing is a procedure to determine the time and magnitude of flow (i.e., the flow hydrograph) at a point on a watercourse from known or assumed hydrographs at one or more points upstream. If the flow is a flood, the procedure is specifically known as flood routing. In a broad sense, flow routing may be considered as an analysis to trace the flow through a hydrologic system, given the input. The difference between Jumped and distributed system routing is that in a lumped system model, the flow is calculated as a function of time alone at a particular location, while in a distributed system routing the flow is calculated as a function of space and time throughout the system.

In other words, flood routing is flow routing applied to flood events, focusing on predicting the timing and magnitude of flood peaks and the overall flood hydrograph. This distinction is crucial because flood routing often requires more detailed and accurate predictions due to the potential for significant damage and loss of life associated with flooding. Understanding the differences between flood routing and general flow routing is essential for hydrologists to apply the appropriate methods and models for different types of flow events."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic systems, why is it important to consider the input when analyzing flow routing?", "answer": "Considering the input is crucial when analyzing flow routing because it allows for the tracing of flow through the hydrologic system. The input, whether it be rainfall, snowmelt, or other sources of water, drives the flow through the system, and understanding this input is essential for accurately predicting the flow hydrograph at different points within the system. This is because the input affects the timing, magnitude, and distribution of flow, which in turn impact the overall behavior of the hydrologic system. By considering the input, hydrologists can better understand the complex interactions within the system and make more accurate predictions about flow routing."}, {"question": "How do lumped and distributed system routing methods compare in terms of their application to real-world hydrologic problems?", "answer": "Lumped and distributed system routing methods differ significantly in their application to real-world hydrologic problems. Lumped system routing is often used for simpler, more homogeneous watersheds where the flow can be adequately represented by a single point or a small number of points. In contrast, distributed system routing is more suitable for complex, heterogeneous watersheds where the flow varies significantly over space and time. Distributed system routing can provide more detailed and accurate predictions, especially in cases where the watershed's topography, soil properties, and land use vary significantly. However, it also requires more extensive data and computational resources, making it more challenging to apply in practice. The choice between lumped and distributed system routing depends on the specific characteristics of the watershed, the availability of data, and the desired level of accuracy in the flow predictions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using lumped system routing for predicting flood events?", "answer": "Using lumped system routing for predicting flood events can have significant implications. On one hand, lumped system routing can provide a simplified and efficient way to predict flood peaks and overall flood hydrographs, which is crucial for flood warning systems and emergency management. However, lumped system routing may not capture the spatial variability of flow, which can lead to inaccurate predictions, especially in complex watersheds. This can result in underestimation or overestimation of flood risks, potentially leading to inadequate preparedness and response measures. Furthermore, lumped system routing may"}]}
{"paragraph": "8.1 LUMPED SYSTEM ROUTING For a hydrologic system, input /(t), output Q(t), and storage S(t) are related by the continuity equation (2.2.4): dS es I(t) — Q(t) (8.1.1) If the inflow hydrograph, /(t), is known, Eq. (8.1.1) cannot be solved directly to obtain the outflow hydrograph, Q(t), because both Q and S are unknown. A second relationship, or storage function, is needed to relate S, J, and Q; coupling 242 LUMPED FLOW ROUTING 243 the storage function with the continuity equation provides a solvable combination of two equations and two unknowns. In general, the storage function may be written as an arbitrary function of J, Q, and their time derivatives as shown by Eq. (7.1.2): 2 2 aig! 9) 22, SP ae (8.1.2) S= f 1f ogdt ’ =dt ? aN ° dt’ ’ dt > In Chapter 7, these two equations were solved by differentiating a linearized form of Eq. (8.1.2), substituting the result for dS/dt into Eq. (8.1.1), then integrating the resulting differential equation to obtain Q(t) as a function of I(t). In this chapter, a finite difference solution method is applied to the two equations. The time horizon is divided into finite intervals, and the continuity equation (8.1.1) is solved recursively from one time point to the next using the storage function (8.1.2) to account for the value of storage at each time point. The specific form of the storage function to be employed in this procedure depends on the nature of the system being analyzed. In this chapter, three partic- ular systems are analyzed. First, reservoir routing by the level pool method, in which storage is a nonlinear function of Q only: S = f(Q) (8.1.3) and the function f(Q) is determined by relating reservoir storage and outflow to reservoir water level. Second, storage is linearly related to 7 and Q in the Muskingum method for flow routing in channels. Finally, several linear reservoir models are analyzed in which (8.1.2) becomes a linear function of Q and its time derivatives. The relationship between the outflow and the storage of a hydrologic system has an important influence on flow routing. This relationship may be either invariable or variable, as shown in Fig. 8.1.1. An invariable storage function has the form of Eq. (8.1.3) and applies to a reservoir with a horizontal water surface. Such reservoirs have a pool that is wide and deep compared with its length in the direction of flow. The velocity of flow in the reservoir is very low. The invariable storage relationship requires that there be a fixed discharge from the reservoir for a given water surface elevation, which means that the reservoir outlet works must be either uncontrolled, or controlled by gates held at a fixed position. If the control gate position is changed, the discharge and water surface elevation change at the dam, and the effect propagates upstream in the reservoir to create a sloping water surface temporarily, until a new equilibrium water surface elevation is established throughout the reservoir. When a reservoir has a horizontal water surface, its. storage is a function of its water surface elevation, or depth in the pool. Likewise, the outflow discharge is a function of the water surface elevation, or head on the outlet works. By com- bining these two functions, the reservoir storage and discharge can be related to produce an invariable, single-valued storage function, S =f(Q), as shown in Fig. 8.1.1(a). For such reservoirs, the peak outflow occurs when the outflow hydro- graph intersects the inflow hydrograph, because the maximum storage occurs 244 appLiED HYDROLOGY LQ Inflow Q R,P 0 0 S (a) Invariable relationship (b) Variable relationship FIGURE 8.1.1 Relationships between discharge and storage. when dS/dt = I — Q = 0, and the storage and outflow are related by S = f(Q). This is indicated in Fig. 8.1.1(a) where the points denoting the maximum storage, R, and maximum outflow, P, coincide. A variable storage-outflow relationship applies to long, narrow reservoirs, and to open channels or streams, where the water surface profile may be signif- icantly curved due to backwater effects. The amount of storage due to backwater depends on the time rate of change of flow through the system. As shown in Fig. 8.1.1(b), the resulting relationship between the discharge and the system storage is no longer a single-valued function but exhibits a curve usually in the form of a single or twisted loop, depending on the storage characteristics of the system. Because of the retarding effect due to backwater, the peak outflow usually occurs later than the time when the inflow and outflow hydrographs intersect, as indi- cated in Fig. 8.1.1(b), where the points R and P do not coincide. If the backwater effect is not very significant, the loop shown in Fig. 8.1.1(b) may be replaced by an average curve shown by the dashed line. Thus, level pool routing methods can also be applied in an approximate way to routing with a variable discharge- storage relationship. The preceding discussion indicates that the effect of storage is to redistribute the hydrograph by shifting the centroid of the inflow hydrograph to the position of that of the outflow hydrograph in a time of redistribution. In very long channels, the entire flood wave also travels a considerable distance and the centroid of its hydrograph may then be shifted by a time period longer than the time of redistribution. This additional time may be considered as time of translation. As shown in Fig. 8.1.2, the total time of flood movement between the centroids of the outflow and inflow hydrographs is equal to the sum of the time of redistribution and the time of translation. The process of redistribution modifies the shape of the hydrograph, while translation changes its position. LUMPED FLOW ROUTING 245 le?

This effect causes the storage to depend on the time rate of change of flow, leading to a non-single-valued function between discharge and system storage.

However, this approach has limitations, as it simplifies the complex dynamics of backwater effects and the resulting variable storage function. The accuracy of this method depends on the significance of backwater effects; if these effects are not very significant, the approximation may be reasonable, but in cases with substantial backwater, more sophisticated methods may be necessary to accurately predict flow routing."}, {"question": "Why is the distinction between invariable and variable storage functions important for predicting flow routing in hydrologic systems?", "answer": "The distinction between invariable and variable storage functions is crucial because it affects the timing and magnitude of peak outflows.

{"paragraph": "8.2 LEVEL POOL ROUTING Level pool routing is a procedure for calculating the outflow hydrograph from a reservoir with a horizontal water surface, given its inflow hydrograph and storage- outflow characteristics. A number of procedures have been proposed for this purpose (e.g., Chow, 1951, 1959), and with the advance of computerization, graphical procedures are being replaced by tabular or functional methods so that the computational procedure can be automated. The time horizon is broken into intervals of duration At, indexed by j, that is, t = 0, At, 2Ar,..., jAt,G + 1)At,..., and the continuity equation (8.1.1) is integrated over each time interval, as shown in Fig. 8.2.1.

{"paragraph": "8.3 RUNGE-KUTTA METHOD An alternative method for level pool routing can be developed by solving the continuity equation using a numerical method such as the Runge-Kutta method. The Runge-Kutta method is more complicated than the method described in the previous section, but it does not require the computation of the special storage- outflow function, and it is more closely related to the hydraulics of flow through the reservoir. Various orders of Runge-Kutta schemes can be adopted (Carnahan, et al., 1969). A third order scheme is described here; it involves breaking each time interval into three increments and calculating successive valueso f water surface elevation and reservoir discharge for each increment. The continuity equation is expressed as & = KH - OH) (8.3.1) t where S is the volume of water in storage in the reservoir; /(t) is the inflow into the reservoir as a function of time; and Q(A) is the outflow from the reservoir, which is determined by the head or elevation (H) in the reservoir. The change in volume, dS, due to a change in elevation, dH, can be expressed as dS = A(H)dH (873-2) where A(H) is the water surface area at elevation H. The continuity equation is then rewritten as dH _ Kt) ~ OH) (8.3.3) dt A(H) The solution is extended forward by small increments of the independent variable, time, using known values of the dependent variable H. For a third order scheme, there are three such increments in each time interval Ar, and three successive approximations are made for the change in head elevation, dH. Fig. 8.3.1 illustrates how the three approximate values AH,, AH>, and AH; are defined for the j-th interval. The slope, dH/dt, approximated by AH/Ar, is first evaluated at (H;,1t;), then at (Hj + AH,/3,t; + At/3), and finally at (H; + 2AH)/3,t; + 2At/3).

{"paragraph": "8.4 HYDROLOGIC RIVER ROUTING The Muskingum method is a commonly used hydrologic routing method for han- dling a variable discharge-storage relationship. This method models the storage volume of flooding in a river channel by a combination of wedge and prism stor- ages (Fig. 8.4.1). During the advance of a flood wave, inflow exceeds outflow, producing a wedge of storage. During the recession, outflow exceeds inflow, resulting in a negative wedge. In addition, there is a prism of storage which is formed by a volume of constant cross section along the length of prismatic channel. Assuming that the cross-sectional area of the flood flow is directly propor- tional to the discharge at the section, the volume of prism storage is equal to KQ where K is a proportionality coefficient, and the volume of wedge storage is equal to KX(/ — Q), where X is a weighting factor having the range 0 = X = 0.5. The total storage is therefore the sum of two components, S = KQ + KX(J- Q) (8.4.1) which can be rearranged to give the -torage function for the Muskingum method S = K[xXI + (1 — XQ] (8.4.2) and represents a linear model for routing flow in streams. The value of X depends on the shape of the modeled wedge storage. The value of X ranges from 0 for reservoir-type storage to 0.5 for a full wedge. When X = 0, there is no wedge and hence no backwater; this is the case for a level-pool reservoir. In this case, Eq. (8.4.2) results in a linear-reservoir model, S = KQ. In natural’ streams, X is between 0 and 0.3 with a mean value near 0.2. Great accuracy in determining X may not be necessary because the results of the method are relatively insensitive to the value of this parameter. The parameter K is the time of travel of the flood wave through the channel reach. A procedure called the Muskingum-Cunge method is described in Chapter 9 for determining the values of K and X on the basis of channel characteristics and flow rate in the channel. For hydrologic routing, the values of K and X are assumed to be specified and constant throughout the range of flow.

Since K is the time required for the incremental flood wave to traverse the reach, its value may also be estimated as the observed time of travel of peak flow through the reach.

A single linear reservoir is a simplified case of the Muskingum model with X = 0. The impulse, pulse, and step response functions of a linear reservoir are plotted in Fig. 7.2.4. Linear Reservoirs in Series A watershed may be represented by a series of n identical linear reservoirs (Fig. 8.5.1) each having the same storage constant k (Nash, 1957). By routing a unit- volume inflow through the n linear reservoirs, a mathematical model for the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) of the series can be derived. The impulse response function of a linear reservoir was derived in Ex. (7.2.1) as u(t — 7) = (1/k) exp [—(t — 7)/k]. This will be the outflow from the first reservoir, and constitutes the inflow to the second reservoir with 7 substituted for t — 7, that is for the second reservoir /(7) = (1/k) exp (—7/k). The convolution integral (7.2.1) gives the outflow from the second reservoir as q2(t) = [r ome =\"'n)dr = [ SILER Oro LPE (8.5.2) o\\k k aot mk — rol u This outflow is then used as the inflow to the third reservoir. Continuing this procedure will yield the outflow gq, from the n-th reservoir as n=l ate ew (8.5.3) u(t) = gn{t) = where I'(n) = (n— 1)! When n is not an integer, I'(n) can be interpolated from tables of the gamma function (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965). This equation expresses the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the proposed model; mathematically, it is a gamma probability distribution function. The integral of the right side of the equation over t from zero to infinity is equal to 1. It can be shown that the first and second moments of the IUH about the origin t = 0 are respectively M, = nk (8.5.4) and M> = n(n + 1)k? (8.5.5) The first moment, M,, represents the lag time of the centroid of the area under the IUH. Applying the IUH in the convolution integral to relate the excess rainfall hyetograph (ERH) to the direct runoff hydrograph (DRH), the principle of linearity 262 apPLIED HYDROLOGY requires each infinitesimal element of the ERH to yield its corresponding DRH with the same lag time. In other words, the time difference between the centroids of areas under the ERH and the DRH should be equal to M;. By the method of moments, the values of k and n can be computed from a given ERH and DRH, thus providing a simple but approximate calculation of the IUH as expressed by Eq. (8.5.3). If M7, is the first moment of the ERH about the time origin divided by the total effective rainfall, and Mg, is the first moment of the DRH about the time origin divided by the total direct runoff, then Mo, ~ My, = nk (8.5.6) If M;, is the second moment of the ERH about the time origin divided by the total excess rainfall, and Mg, is the second moment of the DRH about the time origin divided by the total direct runoff, it can be shown that Mo, ~ Mi, = n(n + Ik? + 2nkMy, (8.5.7) Since the values of M;,,Mg,, Mz, and Mo, can be computed from given hydrologic data, the values of n and k can be found using Eqs.

(8.5.3) to determine the IUH of this watershed. By using the methods described in Sec. 7.2, the corresponding unit hydrograph can be determined for a specified rainfall duration. Composite Models In hydrologic modeling, linear reservoirs may also be linked in parallel. Linear reservoirs may be used to model subsurface water in a saturated phase (Krai- jenhoff van der Leur, 1958), as well as surface water problems. Diskin et al. (1978) presented a parallel cascade model for urban watersheds. The input to the model is the total rainfall hyetograph, which feeds two parallel cascades of linear reservoirs, for the impervious and pervious areas of the watershed, respectively. Separate excess rainfall hyetographs are determined for the impervious and per- vious areas, and used as input to the two cascades of linear reservoirs. Linear reservoirs in series and parallel may be combined to model a hydro- logic system. The use of linear reservoirs in series represents the storage effect of a hydrologic system, resulting in a time shift of nk between the centroid of the inflow and that of the outflow as given by Eq. (8.5.6). A linear channel is an idealized channel in which the time required to translate a discharge through the channel is constant (Chow, 1964). To model the combined effect of storage and translation, the linear reservoir may be used jointly with a linear channel. Other more elaborate composite models have been proposed. Dooge (1959) suggested a series of alternating linear channels and linear reservoirs. For this model, the drainage area of a watershed is divided into a number of subareas, by isochrones, which are lines of constant travel time to the watershed outlet. Each subarea is represented by a linear channel in series with a linear reservoir. The outflow from the linear channel is represented by the portion of a time-area diagram cor- responding to the subarea. This outflow, together with outflow from the preceding subareas, serves as the inflow to the linear reservoir. Randomized linear reservoir models have also been developed, in which the storage constant k is related to the Horton stream order (Sec. 5.8) of the subarea being drained. By considering the network of streams draining a watershed as being a random combination of linear reservoirs, with the mechanism of the combination being governed by Horton’s stream ordering laws, it is possible to develop a geomorphic instantaneous unit hydrograph, the shape of which is related to the stream pattern of the watershed (Boyd, et al., 1979; Rodriguez- LUMPED FLOW ROUTING 265 Iturbe, and Valdes, 1979; Gupta, et al., 1980; Gupta, Rodriguez-Iturbe, and Wood, 1986).

Additionally, the method's assumption of linearity may not hold in watersheds where nonlinear processes dominate, such as those with significant threshold effects in infiltration or runoff generation. Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the watershed's specific hydrological characteristics and potentially adapting or combining the n-linear-reservoir method with other approaches to better capture the complexity of the hydrological response."}, {"question": "How does the constant base flow of 5 m³/s influence the overall hydrological response of the watershed?", "answer": "The constant base flow of 5 m³/s significantly influences the overall hydrological response of the watershed by contributing to the streamflow throughout the rainfall event. This base flow indicates a steady supply of water, likely from groundwater or other storage components within the watershed, which maintains a minimum streamflow level even during periods of no rainfall. The presence of this base flow affects the shape and magnitude of the hydrograph, with implications for flood peak attenuation and low-flow augmentation, and is an essential component in understanding and modeling the watershed's hydrological behavior."}]}

CHAPTER DISTRIBUTED FLOW ROUTING The flow of water through the soil and stream channels of a watershed is a distributed process because the flow rate, velocity, and depth vary in space throughout the watershed. Estimates of the flow rate or water level at important locations in the channel system can be obtained using a distributed flow routing model. This type of model is based on partial differential equations (the Saint- Venant equations for one-dimensional flow) that allow the flow rate and water level to be computed as functions of space and time, rather than of time alone as in the lumped models described in Chaps. 7 and 8. The computation of flood water level is needed because this level delineates the flood plain and determines the required height of structures such as bridges and levees; the computation of flood flow rate is also important; first, because the flow rate determines the water level, and second, because the design of any flood storage structure such as a detention pond or reservoir requires an estimate of its inflow hydrograph. The alternative to using a distributed flow routing model is to use a lumped model to calculate the flow rate at the desired location, then compute the corresponding water level by assuming steady nonuniform flow along the channel at the site. The advantage of a distributed flow routing model over this alternative is that the distributed model computes the flow rate and water level simultaneously instead of separately, so that the model more closely approximates the actual unsteady nonuniform nature of flow propagation in a channel. Distributed flow routing models can be used to describe the transformation of storm rainfall into runoff over a watershed to produce a flow hydrograph for the watershed outlet, and then to take this hydrograph as input at the upstream end of a river or pipe system and route it to the downstream end. Distributed models can 272 DISTRIBUTED FLOW ROUTING 273 also be used for routing low flows, such as irrigation water deliveries through a canal or river system. The true flow process in either of these applications varies in all three space dimensions; for example, the velocity in a river varies along the river, across it, and also from the water surface to the river bed. However, for many practical purposes, the spatial variation in velocity across the channel and with respect to the depth can be ignored, so that the flow process can be approximated as varying in only one space dimension—along the flow channel, or in the direction of flow.

{"paragraph": "9.1 SAINT-VENANT EQUATIONS The following assumptions are necessary for derivation of the Saint-Venant equa- tions: 1. The flow is one-dimensional; depth and velocity vary only in the longitudinal direction of the channel. This implies that the velocity is constant and the water surface is horizontal across any section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. 2. Flow is assumed to vary gradually along the channel so that hydrostatic pressure prevails and vertical accelerations can be neglected (Chow, 1959). 3. The longitudinal axis of the channel is approximated as a straight line. 4. The bottom slope of the channel is small and the channel bed is fixed; that is, the effects of scour and deposition are negligible. 5. Resistance coefficients for steady uniform turbulent flow are applicable so that relationships such as Manning’s equation can be used to describe resistance effects. 6. The fluid is incompressible and of constant density throughout the flow.

This equation, in the form 2F = 0, was applied to steady uniform flow in an open channel in Chap. 2. Here, unsteady nonuniform flow is considered. FORCES. There are five forces acting on the control volume: PO a ea a)O s! 2 el at ad (9.1.10) where F, is the gravity force along the channel due to the weight of the water in the control volume, Fy is the friction force along the bottom and sides of the control volume, F, is the contraction/expansion force produced by abrupt changes in the channel cross section, Fy is the wind shear force on the water surface, and F, is the unbalanced pressure force [see Fig. 9.1.1 (b)]. Each of these five forces is evaluated in the following paragraphs. Gravity. The volume of fluid in the control volume is A dx and its weight is pgA dx. For a small angle of channel inclination 6, S, ~ sin@ and the gravity force is given by F, = pgAsdinx 0 = pgAS,d x (QeTe as) where the channel bottom slope S$, equals — 0z/dx. Friction.

Contraction/expansion. Abrupt contraction or expansion of the channel causes energy loss through eddy motion. Such losses are similar to minor losses in a pipe system. The magnitude of eddy losses is related to the change in velocity head V?/2g = (Q/A)?/2g through the length of channel causing the losses.

The mass inflow rate to the control volume [Eq. (9.1.2)] is —p(Q + qdkx), representing both stream inflow and lateral inflow.

For steady flow, dA/dt = 0 in the continuity equation, and for uniform flow, the lateral inflow q is zero. These distinctions are crucial for accurately modeling various flow scenarios, as they determine the terms that are included or neglected in the equation, thereby influencing the model's complexity and its ability to capture the dynamics of the flow."}, {"question": "Why is it important to account for backwater effects in distributed routing methods, especially in channels with mild slopes?", "answer": "Accounting for backwater effects is important because it allows distributed routing methods to simulate how changes in flow conditions at one point can influence the flow upstream. This is particularly critical in channels with mild slopes where backwater effects are more pronounced. By incorporating local acceleration, convective acceleration, and pressure terms, distributed routing methods can more accurately model these effects, which is essential for understanding and predicting flow behavior in such scenarios."}, {"question": "In what scenarios might the diffusion wave model be preferred over the kinematic wave model for distributed flow routing?", "answer": "The diffusion wave model might be preferred over the kinematic wave model in scenarios where the pressure term in the momentum equation is significant and cannot be neglected. This could be the case in channels where the water depth varies significantly along the channel, affecting the pressure force and thus the flow momentum. The diffusion wave model's inclusion of the pressure term makes it more suitable for simulating such conditions compared to the kinematic wave model."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions of the kinematic wave model, such as neglecting local and convective acceleration terms, impact its applicability to real-world flow scenarios?", "answer": "The kinematic wave model's assumptions, particularly neglecting local and convective acceleration terms, limit its applicability to real-world flow scenarios where these terms are significant. This model is best suited for situations where the flow is relatively simple, and the effects of inertial forces are minimal. However, in many natural channels, these assumptions may not hold, making the kinematic wave model less accurate for predicting flow behavior, especially in cases with significant backwater effects or rapid changes in flow conditions."}, {"question": "Why is the dynamic wave model considered the most comprehensive among the distributed routing models mentioned?", "answer": "The dynamic wave model is considered the most comprehensive because it considers all the acceleration"}]}
{"paragraph": "9.3 WAVE MOTION Kinematic waves govern flow when inertial and pressure forces are not important. Dynamic waves govern flow when these forces are important, such as in the movement of a large flood wave in a wide river. In a kinematic wave, the gravity and friction forces are balanced, so the flow does not accelerate appreciably.

DISTRIBUTED FLOW ROUTING 283 river bank. For a kinematic wave, the energy grade line is parallel to the channel bottom and the flow is steady and uniform (S, = S,) within the differential length, while for a dynamic wave the energy grade line and water surface elevation are not parallel to the bed, even within a differential element. Kinematic Wave Celerity A wave is a variation in a flow, such as a change in flow rate or water surface elevation, and the wave celerity is the velocity with which this variation travels along the channel. The celerity depends on the type of wave being considered and may be quite different from the water velocity. For a kinematic wave the acceleration and pressure terms in the momentum equation are negligible, so the wave motion is described principally by the equation of continuity. The name kinematic is thus applicable, as kinematics refers to the study of motion exclusive of the influence of mass and force; in dynamics these quantities are included. The kinematic wave model is defined by the following equations. Continuity: 0Q OA —Pe a a5 e Momentum: So = Sf (9.3.2) The momentum equation can also be expressed in the form A = aQ? (9.3.3) For example, Manning’s equation written with S, = S; and R = A/P is 1.498 ays PIS A (9.3.4) which can be solved for A as 3/5 p2/3 As aa Qs (9.3.5) so a = [nP?/3/(1.49./S,)]°° and B = 0.6 in this case.

This implies that an observer moving at a velocity dx/dt =c, with the flow would see the flow rate increasing at a rate of dQ/dx =q. If q =0, the observer would see a constant discharge. Eqs. (9.3.10) and (9.3.14) are the characteristic equations for a kinematic wave, two ordinary differential equations that are mathematically equivalent to the governing continuity and momentum equations. The kinematic wave celerity can also be expressed in terms of the depth y as Ck Sa (973515) where dA= Bay. Both kinematic and dynamic wave motion are present in natural flood waves. In many cases the channel slope dominates in the momentum equation (9.2.1); therefore, most of a flood wave moves as.a kinematic wave. Lighthill DISTRIBUTED FLOW ROUTING 285 and Whitham (1955) proved that the velocity of the main part of a natural flood wave approximates that of a kinematic wave. If the other momentum terms [9V/ot, WoV/ dx), and (1/g)dy/dx] are not negligible, then a dynamic ‘wave front exists which can propagate both upstream and downstream from the main body of the flood wave, as shown in Fig. 9.3.2. Miller (1984) summarizes several criteria for determining when the kinematic wave approximation is applicable, but there is no single, universal criterion for making this decision. As previously shown, if a wave is kinematic (S¢ = S,) the kinematic wave celerity varies with dQ/dA. For Manning’s equation, wave celerity increases as Q increases. As a result, the kinematic wave theoretically should advance downstream with its rising limb getting steeper. However, the wave does not get longer, or attenuate, so it does not subside, and the flood peak stays at the same maximum depth. As the wave becomes steeper the other momentum equation terms become more important and introduce dispersion and attenuation. The celerity of a flood wave departs from the kinematic wave celerity because the discharge is not a function of depth alone, and, at the wave crest, Q and y do not remain constant. Lighthill and Whitham (1955) illustrated that the profile of a wave front can be determined by combining the Chezy equation (2.5.5) Q = CARS; (9.3.16) with the momentum equation (9.2.16) to produce moet te 9.3.17) Baa ieee g ot in which C is the Chezy coefficient and R is the hydraulic radius.

For a channel of arbitrary cross section, cg = VgA/B. This celerity cg measures the velocity of a dynamic wave with respect to still water. As shown in Fig. 9.3.2, in moving water there are two dynamic waves, one proceeding upstream with velocity V— cq and the other proceeding downstream with velocity V +c . For the upstream wave to move up the channel requires V < cq, or, equivalently, that the flow be subcritical, since V = Vey is the critical velocity of a rectangular, open-channel flow. and Manning roughness 0.035.

This balance is crucial as it allows the flow to be steady and uniform within a differential length, with the energy grade line parallel to the channel bottom. The kinematic wave model, defined by the continuity and momentum equations, captures this interaction, enabling the prediction of flow behavior under such conditions."}, {"question": "Why do kinematic waves result from changes in flow rate, and what is the implication of this on wave celerity?", "answer": "Kinematic waves result from changes in flow rate, as expressed by the equation dQ = dQ/dx dx + dQ/dt dt. The implication of this is that the wave celerity, which is the velocity at which the variation in flow travels along the channel, varies with the change in flow rate. For instance, in the case of Manning's equation, the wave celerity increases as the flow rate increases, leading to a steeper rising limb of the wave. However, as the wave becomes steeper, other momentum equation terms become more significant, introducing dispersion and attenuation."}, {"question": "In the context of dynamic waves, what is the role of the Chezy equation in determining the profile of a wave front?", "answer": "The Chezy equation, combined with the momentum equation, is used to determine the profile of a wave front in dynamic waves. Specifically, the equation Q = CARS; is combined with the momentum equation to produce an equation that relates the flow rate, channel slope, and hydraulic radius, allowing for the calculation of the wave front profile."}, {"question": "How does the kinematic wave celerity compare to the dynamic wave celerity, and what are the implications for flood wave propagation?", "answer": "The kinematic wave celerity is generally lower than the dynamic wave celerity. The kinematic wave celerity is the velocity at which a kinematic wave travels, while the dynamic wave celerity measures the velocity of a dynamic wave with respect to still water. In the context of flood wave propagation, the kinematic wave celerity is often more relevant, as it represents the velocity at which the main body of the flood wave moves. However, dynamic waves can also play a crucial role, particularly in the formation of wave fronts and the propagation of disturbances upstream and downstream."}, {"question": "What is the condition for a dynamic wave to move upstream, and how does this relate to the flow regime?", "answer": "For a dynamic wave to move upstream, the flow must be subcritical, meaning that the water velocity is less than the critical velocity. This condition is necessary because the dynamic wave celerity must be greater than the water velocity for the wave to propagate upstream. The flow regime, characterized by the Froude number, determines whether the flow is subcritical, critical, or supercritical, and this, in turn, affects the behavior of dynamic waves."}, {"question": "In the context of flood waves, why do kinematic and dynamic wave motions coexist, and what are the implications for wave propagation?", "answer": "Kinematic and dynamic wave motions coexist in flood waves because the channel slope dominates in the momentum equation, causing most of the flood wave to move as a kinematic wave. However, dynamic waves can still form, particularly at the wave front, and can propagate both upstream and downstream from the main body of the flood wave. This coexistence of kinematic and dynamic wave motions has significant implications for wave propagation, as it can lead to the formation of complex wave profiles and affect the timing and magnitude of flood peaks."}, {"question": "How does the kinematic wave celerity vary with flow rate, and what is the underlying reason for this variation?", "answer": "The kinematic wave celerity varies with flow rate, increasing as the flow rate increases. This variation is due to the dependence of the wave celerity on the change in flow rate, as expressed by the equation dQ = dQ/dx dx + dQ/dt dt. As the flow rate increases, the wave celerity increases, leading to a steeper rising limb of the wave."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the characteristic equations for kinematic waves, and how do they relate to the governing continuity and momentum equations?", "answer": "The characteristic equations for kinematic waves, given by Eqs. (9.3.10) and (9.3.14), are significant because they provide a mathematical representation of the kinematic wave motion. These equations are equivalent to the governing continuity and momentum equations and can be used to predict the behavior of kinematic waves. The characteristic equations are useful for analyzing the properties of kinematic waves, such as the wave celerity and the relationship between flow rate and wave profile."}]}
{"paragraph": "9.4 ANALYTICAL SOLUTION OF THE KINEMATIC WAVE The solution of the kinematic wave equations specifies the distribution of the flow as a function of distance x along the channel and time ¢. The solution may be obtained numerically by using finite difference approximations to Eq. (9.3.7), or analytically by solving simultaneously the characteristic equations (9.3.10) and (9.3.14). In this section the analytical method is presented for the special case when lateral inflow is negligible; numerical solution is discussed in Sec. 9.6. The solution for Q(x,t) requires knowledge of the initial condition Q(x,0), or the value of the flow along the channel at the beginning of the calculations, and the boundary condition Q(0,t), the inflow hydrograph at the upstream end of the channel. The objective is to determine the outflow hydrograph at the downstream 288 APPLIED HYDROLOGY end of the channel, Q(L, t), as a function of the inflow hydrograph, any lateral flow occurring along the sides of the channel, and the dynamics of flow in the channel as expressed by the kinematic wave equations. I the lateral flow is neglected, (9.3.10) reduces to dQ/dx =0, or Q =a constant. Thus, if the flow rate is known at a point in time and space, this flow value can be propagated along the channel at the kinematic wave celerity, as given by 24d 0__dk Ck } 9.4.1 dA dt ( ) The solution can be visualized on an x-t plane, as shown in Fig. 9.4.1(5), where distance is plotted on the horizontal axis, and time on the vertical axis.

Rainfall-runoff Process The kinematic wave method has been applied to describe flow over planes, as a model of the rainfall-runoff process. In this application the lateral flow is equal to the difference between the rates of rainfall and infiltration, and the channel flow is taken to be flow per unit width of plane. The characteristic equations can be solved analytically to simulate the outflow hydrograph in response to rainfall of a specified duration. By accumulating the flow from many such planes laid out over a watershed, an approximate model can be developed for the conversion of rainfall into streamflow at the watershed outlet. The kinematic wave model of the rainfall-runoff process offers the advan- tage over the unit hydrograph method that it is a solution of the physical equa- tions governing the surface flow, but the solution is only for one-dimensional flow, whereas the actual watershed surface flow is two-dimensional as the water follows the land surface contour. As a consequence, the kinematic wave param- eters, such as Manning’s roughness coefficient, must be adjusted to produce a realistic outflow hydrograph.

The method is stable for large computation steps with little loss of accuracy and hence works much faster than the explicit method.

Explicit Scheme The finite-difference representation is shown by the mesh of points on the time- distance plane shown in Fig. 9.5.1.

Note that the spatial derivative is written using known terms on time line j. Implicit schemes on the other hand use finite-difference approximations for both the temporal and spatial derivatives in terms of the unknown time line Vere ie The discretization of the x-t plane into a grid for the integration of the finite-difference equations introduces numerical errors into the computation. A finite-difference scheme is stable if such errors are not amplified during succes- sive computation from one time line to the next. The numerical stability of the computation depends on the relative grid size. A necessary but insufficient con- dition for stability of an explicit scheme is the Courant condition (Courant and Friedrichs, 1948). For the kinematic wave equations, the Courant condition is sees ei (9.5.11) Ck where c, is the kinematic wave celerity. For the dynamic wave equations, cx is replaced by V +cq in (9.5.11). The Courant condition requires that the time step 294 APPLIED HYDROLOGY be less than the time for a wave to travel the distance Ax;. If Ar is so large that the Courant condition is not satisfied, then there is, in effect, an accumulation or piling up of water. The Courant condition does not apply to the implicit scheme. For computational purposes in an explicit scheme, Ax is specified and kept fixed throughout the computations, while At is determined at each time step. To do this, a At; just meeting the Courant condition is computed at each grid point i on time line j, and the smallest Ar; is used. Because the explicit method is unstable unless At is small, it is sometimes advisable to determine the minimum At; at a time line j then reduce it by some percentage. The Courant condition does not guarantee stability, and therefore is only a guideline. Implicit Scheme Implicit schemes use finite-difference approximations for both the temporal and spatial derivative in terms of the dependent variable on the unknown time line.

Cunge (1969) showed that for numerical stability it is required that 0 = X = 1/2. Muskingum-Cunge routing is carried out by solving the algebraic equation (9.7.1). The coefficients in Eq. (9.7.1) are computed by using Eqs. (9.7.2) and (9.7.3) along with Eqs. (8.4.8) through (8.4.10) for each time and space point of computation, since K and X both change with respect to time and space. The Muskingum-Cunge method offers two advantages over the standard kinematic wave methods. First, the solution is obtained through a linear algebraic equation (9.7.1) instead of a finite difference or characteristic approximation of a partial differential equation; this allows the entire hydrograph to be obtained at required cross sections instead of requiring solution over the entire length of the channel for each time step, as in the kinematic wave method. Second, the solution using (9.7.1) will tend to show less wave attenuation, permitting a more flexible choice of time and space increments for the computations as compared to the kinematic wave method. The comprehensive British Flood Studies report (Natural Environment Research Council, 1975) concluded that the Muskingum-Cunge method is prefer- able to methods using a diffusion wave model (see Table 9.2.1) because. of its simplicity; its accuracy is similar. Disadvantages of the Muskingum-Cunge method are that it cannot handle downstream disturbances that propagate upstream and that it does not accurately predict the discharge hydrograph at a downstream boundary when there are large variations in the kinematic wave speed such as those which result from the inundation of large flood plains.

This is because the method does not account for these complexities and assumes a simpler relationship between inflow and storage levels."}, {"question": "How does the choice of parameters, such as K and X, affect the Muskingum-Cunge method's performance, and what are the implications of these choices?", "answer": "The choice of parameters K and X, which are a storage constant and a factor expressing the relative influence of inflow on storage levels, respectively, affects the method's performance in terms of accuracy and stability. For numerical stability, it is required that 0 = X = 1/2, as shown by Cunge. The implications of these choices are significant because they influence the method's ability to accurately model hydrologic processes and its computational efficiency."}, {"question": "What are the advantages of using the Muskingum-Cunge method over diffusion wave models, according to the British Flood Studies report?", "answer": "The British Flood Studies report concluded that the Muskingum-Cunge method is preferable to methods using a diffusion wave model due to its simplicity, with similar accuracy. This preference is based on the method's ability to provide accurate results with less computational complexity."}, {"question": "In the context of kinematic wave routing, how do the coefficients in the Muskingum-Cunge equation (9.7.1) relate to the physical characteristics of the channel, and what equations are used to compute them?", "answer": "The coefficients in the Muskingum-Cunge equation (9.7.1) are computed using equations (9.7.2) and (9.7.3), along with equations (8.4.8) through (8.4.10), which relate to the physical characteristics of the channel, such as the storage constant K and the factor X. These coefficients change with respect to time and space, reflecting the dynamic nature of hydrologic processes in the channel."}, {"question": "Why is the Muskingum-Cunge method considered an approximate solution of the kinematic wave equations and under what conditions does it also approximate a modified diffusion equation?", "answer": "The Muskingum-Cunge method is considered an approximate solution of the kinematic wave equations because it simplifies the complex relationships between flow, storage, and channel characteristics into a linear algebraic equation. It also approximates a modified diffusion equation under specific conditions, such as when the time of propagation of a given discharge along a reach of length Ax is considered, and equations (9.7.2) and (9.7.3) are satisfied. This dual nature of the method makes it versatile for various hydrologic modeling tasks."}, {"question": "How does the Muskingum-Cunge method handle the computation of discharge at different points in space and time, and what are the implications for modeling complex hydrologic systems?", "answer": "The Muskingum-Cunge method computes discharge at different points in space and time by solving the algebraic equation (9.7.1) for each time and space point of computation. This approach allows for the modeling of complex hydrologic systems by considering the spatial and temporal variability of hydrologic processes. However, it also implies that the method may not capture all the nuances of complex systems, especially those involving significant downstream disturbances or rapid changes in channel characteristics."}]}

The choice between these methods depends on the specific characteristics of the problem being solved, such as the complexity of the channel geometry and the flow conditions. Numerical methods, for instance, can provide more accurate solutions for problems involving irregular channel shapes or unsteady flow conditions, but they often require significant computational resources."}, {"question": "In the context of flow resistance in a wide, rectangular channel, why is Manning’s equation used?", "answer": "Manning’s equation is used to describe the flow resistance in a wide, rectangular channel because it provides a simple yet effective way to model the relationship between flow velocity, channel geometry, and frictional resistance. This equation is particularly useful for engineering applications where the flow is turbulent and the channel is relatively wide compared to its depth. However, it is essential to note that Manning’s equation has its limitations, especially for channels with complex geometries or non-uniform flow conditions, where more sophisticated models may be required."}, {"question": "What is the formula for the kinematic wave celerity when Manning’s equation is used, and what does it imply?", "answer": "The formula for the kinematic wave celerity is c = 5V/3, where V is the average velocity. This implies that the speed at which a kinematic wave propagates through a channel is directly related to the average flow velocity. The factor of 5/3 indicates that the wave celerity is greater than the average flow velocity, which has significant implications for the prediction of flood waves and the design of flood control structures. Understanding this relationship is crucial for hydrologists and engineers to accurately model and manage water flow in channels."}, {"question": "How does the kinematic wave celerity relate to the average velocity in a channel, and what are the implications for flood wave prediction?", "answer": "The kinematic wave celerity (c) is related to the average velocity (V) by the formula c = 5V/3, indicating that the wave travels faster than the average flow. This relationship is critical for predicting the arrival time and magnitude of flood waves. For instance, in the event of a sudden increase in rainfall, understanding how quickly the resulting flood wave will propagate through the channel is essential for issuing timely warnings and implementing flood mitigation measures. The difference between the wave celerity and the average flow velocity must be considered to accurately forecast the flood wave’s behavior and potential impacts on downstream communities and infrastructure."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is it important to choose the appropriate method for solving kinematic wave equations?", "answer": "Choosing the appropriate method (analytical or numerical) for solving kinematic wave equations is important because it directly affects the accuracy and reliability of the model predictions. Incorrectly selecting a method can lead to significant errors in predicting water levels, flow rates, and flood wave propagation, which can have serious consequences for flood risk management, water resource planning, and environmental protection. Furthermore, the choice of method can influence the computational efficiency and data requirements of the model, impacting its practicality for real-world applications."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of using Manning’s equation for describing flow resistance, and how do these limitations impact hydrological modeling?", "answer": "Manning’s equation has limitations, particularly for channels with complex geometries, non-uniform flow conditions, or where the flow is not fully turbulent. These limitations can impact hydrological modeling by introducing errors in the prediction of flow velocities, water levels, and flood wave behavior. For example, in channels with significant vegetation or irregular cross-sections, more advanced models that account for these factors may be necessary to achieve accurate predictions. Recognizing the limitations of Manning’s equation is crucial for selecting the most appropriate model for a given application and for interpreting the results of hydrological models with caution."}, {"question": "How does the formula for kinematic wave celerity, derived from Manning’s equation, contribute to our understanding of flood wave dynamics?", "answer": "The formula c = 5V/3 contributes significantly to our understanding of flood wave dynamics by providing a direct relationship between the wave propagation speed and the average flow velocity. This insight is vital for predicting the timing and magnitude of flood peaks, as well as for designing effective flood mitigation strategies. By understanding how flood waves propagate through channels, hydrologists and engineers can better manage water resources, protect infrastructure, and safeguard communities against flood risks. Moreover, this formula highlights the importance of considering the dynamic behavior of flood waves in hydrological modeling and flood risk assessment."}]}

This is because rougher channels have more friction, which slows down the flow, leading to longer travel times. In the context of the given problem, a Manning roughness n of 0.045 suggests a moderate level of roughness, which would impact the travel time accordingly."}, {"question": "In the context of the provided channel dimensions and flow rate, why is it important to calculate the travel time T?", "answer": "Calculating the travel time T is important because it allows for the understanding of how long it takes for the kinematic wave to travel through the channel, which is crucial for predicting the timing and magnitude of downstream flow responses. This information is vital for flood control, water resource management, and understanding the overall hydrological behavior of the channel. By knowing the travel time, hydrologists can better manage and predict the effects of flow changes, such as those caused by rainfall or human interventions."}, {"question": "How do changes in the channel's slope S, impact the travel time T, and what are the implications for water flow?", "answer": "Changes in the channel's slope S, significantly impact the travel time T, as steeper slopes result in faster travel times due to increased gravitational acceleration of the flow. In the given scenario, a slope S, of 0.00035 is relatively gentle, which means the flow will travel more slowly compared to a steeper slope. This has implications for water flow, as gentler slopes can lead to more uniform flow distributions and potentially reduce the risk of erosion or flooding downstream, but may also increase travel times and affect the overall efficiency of water conveyance."}, {"question": "In the context of the given problem, what is the approximate travel time T for the kinematic wave, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "The approximate travel time T for the kinematic wave in the given channel is calculated based on the provided formula, which takes into account the width B, length L, slope S,, Manning roughness n, and flow Q. Given the specific values of B = 200 ft, L = 265 mi, S, = 0.00035, n = 0.045, and Q = 2000 cfs, the travel time T can be computed to understand how long it takes for the wave to travel through the channel."}, {"question": "Why is the width B of the channel an important factor in determining the travel time T of the kinematic wave?", "answer": "The width B of the channel is an important factor because it influences the cross-sectional area of the flow, which in turn affects the velocity of the flow. A wider channel can accommodate more flow, potentially increasing the velocity and thus reducing the travel time, assuming other factors remain constant. However, the relationship between width and travel time is complex and interacts with other factors like slope, roughness, and flow rate, making it essential to consider all these variables when calculating travel time."}, {"question": "How does the length L of the channel affect the travel time T, and what implications does this have for long channels like the one described?", "answer": "The length L of the channel directly affects the travel time T, as longer channels result in longer travel times due to the increased distance the wave must travel. For long channels like the one described (L = 265 mi), the travel time will be significantly longer compared to shorter channels, which has implications for the timing of downstream flow responses and the management of water resources. Longer travel times can provide more time for flow attenuation and dispersion, potentially reducing peak flows and alleviating flood risks, but they also mean that the effects of upstream changes may be delayed, complicating real-time management decisions."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is understanding the travel time T of kinematic waves important for predicting downstream flow responses?", "answer": "Understanding the travel time T of kinematic waves is crucial for predicting downstream flow responses because it allows hydrologists to anticipate when and how changes in upstream flow will affect downstream areas. This knowledge is essential for flood forecasting, water supply management, and ecosystem health, as it enables the prediction of flow rates, water levels, and the potential for flooding or droughts. By accurately modeling travel times, hydrologists can provide critical information for decision-making, helping to mitigate the impacts of extreme hydrological events and ensure the sustainable management of water resources."}]}

The desire to build and live along rivers creates the necessity for accurate calculation of water levels and flow rates and provides the impetus to develop complex flow routing models, such as dynamic wave models. Another impetus for developing dynamic wave models is the need for more accurate hydrologic simulation, in particular, simulation of flow in urban watersheds and storm drainage systems. The dynamic wave model can also be used for routing low flows through rivers or irrigation channels to provide better control of water distribution. The propagation of flow along a river channel or an urban drainage system is an unsteady nonuniform flow, unsteady because it varies in time, nonuniform because flow properties such as water surface elevation, velocity, and discharge are not constant along the channel. One-dimensional distributed routing methods have been classified in Chap. 9 as kinematic wave routing, diffusion wave routing, and dynamic wave routing. Kinematic waves govern the flow when the inertial and pressure forces are not important, that is, when the gravitational force of the flow is balanced by the frictional resistance force. Chapter 9 demonstrated that the kinematic wave approximation is useful for applications where the channel slopes are steep and backwater effects are negligible. When pressure forces become important but inertial forces remain unimportant, a diffusion wave model is applicable. Both the kinematic wave model and the diffusion wave model are helpful in describing downstream wave propagation when the channel slope is greater than about 0.5 ft/mi (0.01 percent) and there are no waves propagating upstream due to 310 DYNAMIC WAVE ROUTING 311 disturbances such as tides, tributary inflows, or reservoir operations. When both inertial and pressure forces are important, such as in mild-sloped rivers, and backwater effects from downstream disturbances are not negligible, then both the inertial force and pressure force terms in the momentum equation are needed. Under these circumstances the dynamic wave routing method is required, which involves numerical solution of the full Saint-Venant equations. Dynamic routing was first used by Stoker (1953) and by Isaacson, Stoker, and Troesch (1954, 1956) in their pioneering investigation of flood routing for the Ohio River.

Flow propagation in natural rivers is complicated by several factors: junc- tions and tributaries, variations in cross section, variations in resistance as a function both of flow depth and of location along the river, inundated areas, and meandering of the river. The interaction between the main channel and the flood plain or inundated valley is one of the most important factors affecting flood propagation. During the rising part of a flood wave, water flows into the flood plain or valley from the main channel, and during the falling flood, water flows from the inundated valley back into the main channel. The effect of the valley storage is to decrease the discharge during the falling flood. Also, some losses occur in the valley due to infiltration and evaporation. The flood plain has an effect on the wave celerity because the flood wave progresses more slowly in the inundated valley than in the main channel of a river This difference in wave celerities disperses the flood wave and causes flow from the main channel to the flood plain during the rising flood by creating a transverse water surface slope away from the channel. During the falling flood, the transverse slope is inward from the inundated valley into the main channel, and water then moves from the flood plain back into the main channel [see Fig. 10.1.3(a) and (5)]. Because the longitudinal axes of the main channel and the flood plain valley are rarely parallel, the situation described above is even more complicated in a DYNAMIC WAVE ROUTING 313 (b) Transverse slope during falling flood. FIGURE 10.1.3 (d) Meandering main channel. Aspects of flow in natural rivers. meandering river. For a large flood, the axis of the flow becomes parallel to the valley axis [Fig. 10.1.3(c) and (d)]. The valley water slope and valley water velocity (if depths are sufficient) can be greater than in the main channel, which has a longer flow path than the valley. This situation makes it difficult for flow to go from the main channel to the flood plain valley during the rising flood and vice versa during the falling flood. Flood wave propagation is more complex when the flow is varying rapidly. The description is also more complicated for a branching river system with tributaries and the possibility of flood peaks from different tributaries coinciding. Also, with tributaries, the effects on flood propagation of backwater at the junctions must be considered. When backwater effects exist, the loop rating curve may consist of a series of loops, each corresponding to a different feature controlling water level in the channel (see Fig. 10.1.4). Backwater effects of reservoirs, channel junctions, narrowing of the natural river channel, and bridges can demonstrate this charac- teristic. 314 appLIED HYDROLOGY FIGURE 10.1.4 Loop rating curve with significant backwater effects.

IMPLICIT DYNAMIC WAVE MODEL Implicit finite-difference methods advance the solution of the Saint-Venant equa- tion from one time line to the next simultaneously for all points along the time line. A system of algebraic equations is generated by applying the Saint-Venant equations simultaneously to all the unknown values on a time line. Implicit meth- ods were developed because of the limitation on the time-step size required for numerical stability of explicit methods. For example, an explicit method might require a time step of one minute for stability, while an implicit method applied to the same problem could use a time step of one hour or longer. The implicit finite-difference scheme uses a weighted four-point method between adjacent time lines at a point M, as shown in Fig. 10.2.1. If a given variable describing the flow, such as flow rate or water surface level, is denoted by u, the time derivative of u is approximated by the average of the finite difference values at distance points i and i + 1.

A scheme using @ =0.5 is called a box scheme. When 6 = 0, the point M is located on the jth time line and the scheme is fully explicit, while a value of 0 = | is used in a fully implicit scheme with M lying in the (7 + 1)th time line. Implicit schemes are those with 6 in the range 0.5 to 1.0; Fread (1973a, 1974a) recommends a value of 0.55 to 0.6. A major difference between the explicit and implicit methods is that implicit methods are conditionally stable for all time steps, whereas explicit methods are numerically stable only for time steps less than a critical value determined by the Courant condition. Fread (1973a, 1974a) has shown that the weighted four- point scheme is unconditionally linearly stable for any time step if 0.5 = 6 = 1.0. This scheme has a second-order accuracy when 6 = 0.5 and a first-order accuracy when 6 = 1.0. 316 APPLIED HYDROLOGY | 3583 cfs 3470 cfs j+i (1 —6)At foOs At=1h = 6 Ar j $ 3500 cfs 3386 cfs Ax = 1000 ft i i+] Distance x FIGURE 10.2.2 Values of the flow rate at four points in the x-t plane (Example 10.2.1). are as shown in Fig. 10.2.2.

This yields 2N — 2 equations. There are two unknowns at each of the N grid points (Q and h), so there are 2N unknowns in all. The two additional equations required to complete the solution are supplied by the upstream and downstream boundary conditions.

This can lead to a series of loops in the rating curve, each corresponding to a different feature controlling water level in the channel. The interaction between the main channel and the flood plain or inundated valley is a critical factor, with water flowing into the flood plain during the rising flood and back into the main channel during the falling flood, thereby affecting the discharge and wave celerity."}, {"question": "In the context of implicit dynamic wave models, why are implicit finite-difference methods preferred over explicit methods?", "answer": "Implicit finite-difference methods are preferred because they are conditionally stable for all time steps, allowing for larger time steps without compromising numerical stability.

The weighted four-point scheme used in implicit methods provides a good balance between stability and accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of flow simulations."}, {"question": "What is the role of the momentum correction factor in the Saint-Venant equations?", "answer": "The momentum correction factor, denoted by β, accounts for the non-uniform distribution of velocity across the channel cross-section. It is used to correct the momentum equation and ensure that the simulated flow accurately represents the actual flow conditions."}, {"question": "How do tributaries and channel junctions affect flood propagation in a branching river system?", "answer": "Tributaries and channel junctions can significantly affect flood propagation by introducing additional complexity, such as backwater effects at junctions and the possibility of flood peaks from different tributaries coinciding. This can lead to a more complicated rating curve, with multiple loops and variable energy slopes, making it challenging to accurately model and predict flood behavior."}, {"question": "In the context of finite difference equations, what is the purpose of the weighting factor δ in the implicit finite-difference scheme?", "answer": "The weighting factor δ is used to define the spatial derivative and locate point M in the x-t plane. A value of δ = 0.5 corresponds to a box scheme, while δ = 0 and δ = 1 correspond to fully explicit and fully implicit schemes, respectively.

Accurate representation of these factors is crucial for simulating realistic flood wave behavior."}, {"question": "In the context of dynamic wave routing, what are the implications of using a variable energy slope in the simulation?", "answer": "Using a variable energy slope in dynamic wave routing allows for the accurate representation of complex flow phenomena, such as backwater effects and tributary interactions.

The computational procedure for each time j + 1 starts by assigning trial values to the 2NV unknowns at that time. These trial values of Q and h can be the values known at time j from the initial condition (if j= 1) or from calculations during the previous time step. Using the trial values in the system (10.4.1) results in 2N residuals.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique for solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. It uses the same idea as was presented in Chap. 5 for the determination of flow depth in Manning’s equation, except that here the solution is for a vector of variables rather than for a single variable.

{"paragraph": "10.5 DWOPER MODEL In the early 1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) Hydrologic Research Laboratory began to develop a dynamic wave routing model based upon the implicit finite-difference solution of the Saint-Venant equations described in the previous section. This model, known as DWOPER (Dynamic Wave Opera- tional Model) has been implemented on various rivers with backwater effects and mild bottom slopes. It has been applied to the Mississippi, Ohio, Columbia, Mis- souri, Arkansas, Red, Atchafalaya, Cumberland, Tennessee, Willamette, Platte, Kamar, Verdigris, Ouachita, and Yazoo rivers in the United States (Fread, 1978), and has also been used in many other countries. One of the DWOPER applications described by Fread (1978) deals with the Mississippi-Ohio-Cumberland-Tennessee system, a branching river system consisting of 393 miles of the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers as shown in Fig. 10.5.1. Eleven gaging stations located at Fords Ferry, Golconda, Paducah, Metropolis, Grand Chain, Cairo, New Madrid, Red Rock, Grand Tower, Cape Girardeau, and Price Landing were used to evaluate the simulation by comparing the observed and calculated water levels and flow rates at those locations. Figure 10.5.2 shows the observed vs. simulated stages at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and at Cairo, Illinois, for a flood in 1970. In applying DWOPER to this system, the main stem river is considered to be the Ohio—Lower Mississippi segment, with the Cumberland, Tennessee, and upper Mississippi rivers considered first-order tributaries (Fread, 1973b). The channel bottom slope is mild, varying from about 0.25 to about 0.50 ft/mi (0.005- 0.01 percent). Each branch of the river system is influenced by backwater from downstream branches. Total discharge through the system varies from low flows of approximately 120,000 cfs to flood flows of 1,700,000 cfs. A total of 45 cross sections located at unequal intervals ranging from 0.5 to 21 miles were used to describe the system. Three months of simulation time, comparing 20 observed and computed hydrographs using 24-hour time steps, required 15 seconds of CPU time on an IBM 360/195 computer. Another application by Fread (1974b) on the lower Mississippi illustrates the utility of DWOPER simulating floods resulting from hurricanes.

In terms of computational efficiency, the DWOPER model is relatively fast, requiring only 15 seconds of CPU time on an IBM 360/195 computer to simulate three months of flood events, making it a viable option for real-time flood forecasting.

The use of 24-hour time steps in the simulation allows for a detailed representation of the flood wave propagation and the resulting water levels and flow rates at the gaging stations.

{"paragraph": "10.6 FLOOD ROUTING IN MEANDERING RIVERS The dynamic wave model developed in the previous section can be expanded to consider flood routing through meandering rivers in wide fluod plains (Fig. 10.6.1). The unsteady flow in a river which meanders through a flood plain is complicated by five effects: (1) differences in hydraulic resistances of the main river channel and the flood plain; (2) variation in the cross-sectional geometries of the channel and the plain; (3) short-circuiting effects, in which the flow leaves the meandering main channel and takes a more direct route on the flood plain; (4) DYNAMIC WAVE ROUTING 327 S(almsftebetevao aeagv lene) Time (days) — Observed +++ Simulated (a) Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

Because of these differences, the attenuation and travel time of flow in the channel can differ significantly from that in the flood plain.

Unsteady flow in natural meandering rivers in wide flood plains is complicated by large differences in resistance and cross-sectional geometries of the river and the flood plain. As shown, further complications are due to the short circuiting of flow along the more direct route of the flood plain. As a result, the wave attenuation and travel time differ between the flood plain and the channel. The total cross-sectional area of flow is the sum of A,, A;, A,, and A,. The constants K,, K,;, and K, divide the total flow Q into channel flow, left flood plain flow, and right flood plain flow, respectively, and are defined as K, = =Q./Q, Ki = Q)/Q, and K, = Q,/Q. The flow is assumed one-dimensional, so the water surface is horizontal across the three sections and the head loss hy incurred in traveling between two river cross sections is the same no matter which flow path is adopted. Hence, hy = Sy Ax in each section of the flow (left, channel, and right), and Sy = hj Ax.

The differences in hydraulic resistances, cross-sectional geometries, and the interactions between the main channel and the flood plain require sophisticated models that can account for these factors. The use of models like the dynamic wave model and Fread's model can improve the accuracy of flood predictions, but the complexity of the system also underscores the need for detailed data and careful calibration of these models. Furthermore, understanding these complexities is crucial for effective floodplain management, including the design of flood control structures and the implementation of flood mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "How does the weighted four-point implicit scheme contribute to solving the dynamic wave model for meandering rivers?", "answer": "The weighted four-point implicit scheme is used to solve the dynamic wave model for the unknowns A (cross-sectional area) and Q (flow rate), providing a numerical method to handle the complex equations that describe the flow in the channel and the flood plain.

By accounting for these differences, models can more accurately predict flood stages and flow rates, which is critical for flood warning systems and floodplain management. This distinction also allows for a more detailed understanding of the complex processes involved in flood routing, enabling better model calibration and validation."}, {"question": "How does the concept of dead storage areas in flood plains affect flood routing in meandering rivers?", "answer": "Dead storage areas in flood plains, where the flow velocity is negligible, affect flood routing by altering the flow path and velocity, thereby influencing the attenuation and travel time of the flood wave. These areas can temporarily store water, reducing the peak flow rate in the main channel, but they can also contribute to a prolonged flood duration as water slowly drains back into the channel. This phenomenon complicates flood prediction, as it requires models to accurately account for the storage and release of water from these areas."}, {"question": "Why is the dynamic wave model incorporated into the National Weather Service computer program DAMBRK?", "answer": "The dynamic wave model is incorporated into DAMBRK because it provides a robust method for analyzing floods that could result from dam breaks. By simulating the unsteady flow in rivers, including the complexities of meandering rivers and flood plains, the model helps predict the timing and magnitude of flood peaks, which is essential for issuing timely and accurate flood warnings"}]}
{"paragraph": "10.7 DAM-BREAK FLOOD ROUTING Forecasting downstream flash floods due to dam failures is an application of flood routing that has received considerable attention. The most widely used dam-breach model is the National Weather Service DAMBRK* model by Fread (1977, 1980, 1981). This model consists of three functional parts: (1) temporal and geometric description of the dam breach; (2) computation of the breach outflow hydrograph; and (3) routing the breach outflow hydrograph downstream. Breach formation, or the growth of the opening in the dam as it fails, is shown in Fig. 10.7.1. The shape of a breach (triangular, rectangular, or trape- zoidal) is specified by the slope z and the terminal width B,, of the bottom of the breach. The DAMBRK model assumes the breach bottom width starts at a point and enlarges at a linear rate until the terminal width is attained at the end of the failure time interval 7. The breach begins when the reservoir water surface ele- vation h exceeds a specified value h,, allowing for overtopping failure or piping failure. *A computer program for DAMBRK can be obtained from the Hydrologic Research Laboratory, Office of Hydrology, NOAA, National Weather Service, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910. FIGURE 10.7.1 Breach formation. Breach formation in a dam failure is described by the failure time T, the size, and the shape. The shape is specified by z, which defines the side slope of the breach. Typically, 0 =< = 2. The bottom width 6 of the breach is a function of time, with the terminal width being B,,. A triangular breach has B = 0 and z > 0. A rectangular breach has B,, > Q and z = 0. Fora trapezoidal breach, B, > 0 and z > 0. DYNAMIC WAVE ROUTING 331 Reservoir outflow consists of both the breach outflow Q, (broad-crested weir flow) and spillway outflow Q,-: Q=Q2, +Q,; (10.7.1) The breach outflow can be computed using a combination of the formulas for a broad-crested rectangular weir, gradually enlarging as the breach widens, and a trapezoidal weir for the breach end slopes (Fread, 1980): h—h,)'5 O, = 3.1BytyC Ky + 2.452C\\K,(h — hy)? (10.7.2) where f, is the time after the breach starts forming, C, is the correction factor for velocity of approach, K, is the submergence correction for tail water effects on weir outflow, and hy is the elevation of the breach bottom. The spillway outflow can be computed using (Fread, 1980): Q, = CsLs(h — hy)! + V2¢C,Al h — hy)? + Cal dh — hg)?’ +Q, (10.7.3) where C, is the uncontrolled spillway discharge coefficient, L, is the uncontrolled spillway length, h; is the uncontrolled spillway crest elevation, C, is the gated spillway discharge coefficient, A, is the area of gate opening, h, is the center- line elevation of the gated spillway, C is the discharge coefficient for flow over the dam crest, Lg is the length of the crest, hg is the dam crest elevation, and Q, is a constant outflow or leakage. The DAMBRK model uses hydrologic storage routing or the dynamic wave model to compute the reservoir outflow. The reservoir outflow hydrograph is then routed downstream using the full dynamic wave model described in Sec. 10.3; alternatively the dynamic wave model described in Sec. 10.6 for flood routing in meandering rivers with flood plains can be used. The DAMBRK model can simulate several reservoirs located sequentially along a valley with a combination of reservoirs breaching. Highway and railroad bridges with embankments can be treated as internal boundary conditions. Internal boundary conditions are used to describe the flow at locations along a waterway where the Saint-Venant equations are not applicable. In other words, there are locations such as spillways, breaches, waterfalls, bridge openings, highway embankments, and so on, where the flow is rapidly rather than gradually varied. Two equations are required to define an internal boundary condition, because two unknowns (Q and h) are added at the internal boundary. For example, to model a highway stream crossing (Fig. 10.7.2) with flow through a bridge opening Qp,, flow over the embankment Q.m, and flow through a breach, Q,, the two internal boundary conditions are: Ol = Ope Oem + Ob (10.7.4) and COLNG = Q! sta CLOnT5) 332 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Embankment Breach (a) Cross section. if Internal boundary condition equations | | | | “ciel | | [CM | -C,Mi) GMUnt .C,M C,M | | | i earlul eFH bap | Oreeds Sep i-3 H-2 i-] i itl i+2 i+3 (b) Cross section locations.

(10.7.2); Qp, is defined by a rating curve or by an orifice equation, such as On CIANT R TD pay (10.7.6) where Cy is a bridge coefficient; the embankment overflow Qem is defined by a broad-crested weir formula Qin = KenPemCem(t) * he) 3/2 (10.7.7) where Cem, Lem, and Kem are the discharge coefficient, length of embankment, DYNAMIC WAVE ROUTING 333 and submergence correction factor, and hem is the elevation of the top of the embankment. Referring to Fig. 10.7.2, the finite-difference grid illustrates that for a given time line, the continuity and momentum equations are written for each grid where the Saint-Venant equations apply, and the internal boundary conditions are written for the grid from i toi + 1, where the highway crossing is located. Teton Dam Failure The DAMBRK model has been applied (Fread, 1980) to reconstruct the down- stream flood wave caused by the 1976 failure of the Teton Dam in Idaho. The Teton Dam was a 300-foot high earthen dam with a 3000-foot long crest. As a result of the breach of this dam, 11 people were killed, 25,000 people were made homeless, and $400 million in damage occurred in the downstream Teton—Snake River valley. The inundated area in the 60-mile reach downstream of the dam is shown with 12 cross sections marked in Fig. 10.7.3. The downstream valley consisted of a narrow canyon approximately 1000 ft wide for the first 5 miles, and thereafter a wide valley that was inundated to a width of about 9 mi. Manning’s n values ranged from 0.028 to 0.047 as obtained from field estimates. Interpolated cross sections developed by DAMBRK were used so that cross sections were spaced 0.5 miles apart near the dam and 1.5 miles apart at the downstream end of the reach. A total of 77 cross sections were used. The computed reservoir outflow hydrograph is shown in Fig. 10.7.3 with ~ a peak value of 1,652,300 cfs. The peak occurred approximately 1.25 hours after the breach opening formed. It is interesting to note that the peak reservoir outflow was about 20 times greater than the largest recorded flood at the site. The computed peak discharges along the downstream valley are shown in Fig. 10.7.4, which illustrates the rapid attenuation of the peak discharge by storage of water in the flood plain as the flood wave progressed downstream through the valley. The computed flood peak travel times are shown in Fig. 10.7.5, and the computed peak elevations are shown in Fig. 10.7.6. The maximum depth of flooding was approximately 60 ft at the dam. The 55-hour simulation of the Teton flood used an initial time step of 0.06 h. Execution time would be less than 10 seconds on most mainframe computers. FLDWAV Model The FLDWAV model* (Fread, 1985) is a synthesis of DWOPER and DAMBRK, and adds significant modeling capabilities not available in either of the other models.

FLDWAV is coded in FORTRAN IV, and the computer program is of modular design, with each subroutine requiring less than 64 kilobytes of storage. The overall program storage requirement is approximately 256 kilobytes. Program airay sizes are variable, with the size of each array set internally via the input parameters used to describe each particular unsteady flow application. Input data to the program is free- or fixed-format. Program output consists of tabular and/or graphical displays, according to the user’s choice.

This is because these locations introduce complexities that cannot be captured by the standard equations, requiring additional conditions to accurately model the flow."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the FLDWAV model in the context of hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The FLDWAV model is significant as it is a generalized dynamic wave model for one-dimensional unsteady flows in a single or branched waterway, offering capabilities not available in other models, including variable computational intervals, irregular cross-sectional geometry, off-channel storage, and the ability to generate linearly interpolated cross sections and roughness coefficients. This makes it a powerful tool for simulating a wide range of hydrological scenarios."}, {"question": "How does the FLDWAV model handle the treatment of time-dependent dam failures, spillway flows, gate controls, or bridge flows?", "answer": "The FLDWAV model handles these through internal boundaries, enabling the treatment of time-dependent dam failures, spillway flows, gate controls, or bridge flows, or bridge-embankment overtopping flow. This is crucial for accurately modeling real-world scenarios where such events can significantly impact the flow and water levels in a waterway."}, {"question": "In the context of flood routing, what are the implications of using a model like DAMBRK for predicting downstream flood waves?", "answer": "The implications of using a model like DAMBRK for predicting downstream flood waves are significant, as it allows for the accurate forecasting of flash floods caused by dam failures, which can be critical for emergency management and saving lives. The model's ability to simulate the breach formation and the subsequent routing of the flood wave downstream provides valuable information for flood warning systems and mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "Why is the Teton Dam failure case study important in the context of dam-break flood routing?", "answer": "The Teton Dam failure case study is important because it demonstrates the application and effectiveness of the DAMBRK model in reconstructing the downstream flood wave caused by a real dam failure. The study shows how the model can be used to simulate complex scenarios, providing insights into the dynamics of dam-break floods and the importance of accurate modeling for flood forecasting and mitigation."}, {"question": "How does the DAMBRK model account for the reservoir outflow in the context of dam-break flood routing?", "answer": "The DAMBRK model accounts for the reservoir outflow by computing it as the sum of the breach outflow and the spillway outflow, using specific equations for each component. The breach outflow is computed using a combination of formulas for a broad-crested rectangular weir and a trapezoidal weir, while the spillway outflow is computed using an equation that considers the uncontrolled spillway discharge coefficient, length, and crest elevation, among other factors."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what are the advantages of using implicit finite-difference solutions of the Saint-Venant equations, as employed by the FLDWAV model?", "answer": "The advantages of using implicit finite-difference solutions of the Saint-Venant equations include improved numerical stability, especially when dealing with flows that change from supercritical to subcritical or vice versa, and the ability to handle complex boundary conditions and irregular geometries.

The wide, flat flood plain can lead to abrupt changes in hydraulic radius and top width with small changes in elevation, potentially causing numerical instability in the model. This complexity necessitates careful consideration of the hydraulic and geometric properties of the river and its flood plain to ensure stable and accurate modeling."}, {"question": "How does the Manning's n vs. discharge relationship impact the stability of solving the full dynamic wave model?", "answer": "The Manning's n vs. discharge relationship can cause instability problems if it is not accurately represented, as changes in discharge can significantly affect the Manning's roughness factor (n), which in turn affects the hydraulic calculations. An inaccurate representation can lead to errors in the model's predictions, especially under varying flow conditions. It is crucial to accurately determine the relationship between Manning's n and discharge to ensure the stability and reliability of the model."}, {"question": "In the scenario of the 9000-foot-long trapezoidal irrigation channel, what initial condition is used for the simulation, and what is the purpose of placing cross sections at 1000 ft intervals?", "answer": "The initial condition used for the simulation is 200 cfs along the channel. Cross sections are placed at 1000 ft intervals to discretize the channel for modeling purposes, allowing for the simulation of the system's behavior over time and space. This discretization enables the calculation of flow distribution along the channel at specified time intervals, providing insights into how the channel's hydraulic properties and the inflow hydrograph affect the outflow and flow distribution."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider backwater effects in channel systems, as illustrated in problem 10.5.3?", "answer": "Considering backwater effects is important because they can significantly impact the flow behavior and water levels in channel systems, especially when there are tributaries or flow-regulating structures. Backwater effects occur when the flow in a channel is affected by the water level downstream, causing the water to flow backward or accumulate. Accurately modeling these effects is crucial for predicting the hydraulic behavior of channel systems, particularly in scenarios involving complex geometries or flow control structures."}, {"question": "How does the introduction of a tributary channel, as in problem 10.5.2, affect the outflow hydrograph at the downstream boundary of the main channel?", "answer": "The introduction of a tributary channel affects the outflow hydrograph by altering the total discharge at the downstream boundary. The tributary adds its discharge to the main channel, potentially increasing the peak flow and changing the shape of the outflow hydrograph. This change can be significant, depending on the magnitude and timing of the tributary's inflow hydrograph relative to the main channel's inflow."}, {"question": "In the context of flow-regulating structures, such as the one placed between stations 5 and 6 on the tributary in problem 10.5.4, how do these structures influence the flow behavior in channel systems?", "answer": "Flow-regulating structures influence the flow behavior by controlling the discharge based on the stage (water level) at the structure. The rating table provided for the structure dictates how much water can pass through at different stages, effectively regulating the flow. This regulation can prevent excessive flows downstream, mitigate flooding, or ensure a minimum flow for downstream uses, but it also introduces complexity that must be accurately modeled to predict the system's behavior."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of using a computational time step of 0.1 hours in the simulation of the irrigation channel, and how might this choice affect the results?", "answer": "The purpose of using a computational time step of 0.1 hours is to balance between computational efficiency and the accuracy of capturing the temporal variations in the flow. A smaller time step can provide more detailed insights into the transient behavior of the system but at the cost of increased computational time. The choice of time step can affect the results by influencing the model's ability to accurately capture peak flows, flow distributions, and the overall dynamics of the system."}, {"question": "In the scenario described, what is the significance of the downstream boundary condition being a rating curve, and how does it impact the simulation?", "answer": "The downstream boundary condition being a rating curve signifies that the discharge at the downstream end of the channel is a function of the water level (stage) at that point. This relationship is crucial because it determines how water exits the channel, influencing the flow behavior upstream. The rating curve impacts the simulation by providing a realistic boundary condition that reflects the physical constraints of the channel's outlet, such as the channel's geometry and any control structures, thereby affecting the model's predictions"}]}

The flood plains can store and release water, thereby influencing the flood wave propagation and attenuation. This consideration allows for a more accurate representation of the flood routing process, as it accounts for the interactions between the main channel and the adjacent flood plains."}, {"question": "In the development of finite difference equations for continuity and momentum, why is it important to consider dead storage in a meandering river?", "answer": "Dead storage, which refers to areas where water can be stored without contributing to the flow, is important to consider in the development of finite difference equations because it affects the overall water balance and flow routing.

The initial elevation of 2323 ft above mean sea level (MSL) indicates that the reservoir is not empty, and this initial condition affects the subsequent routing computations. The initial elevation also determines the initial storage in the reservoir, which is essential for calculating the outflow."}, {"question": "In the context of dam-break analysis, how does the breach characteristics affect the outflow hydrograph from the reservoir?", "answer": "The breach characteristics, such as the time to maximum breach, breach width, and breach depth, significantly affect the outflow hydrograph from the reservoir. A rectangular breach with a time to maximum breach of 1.25 hours and a width of 200 feet at its base will result in a rapid increase in outflow from the reservoir, leading to a peaked outflow hydrograph. The breach characteristics determine the rate at which water is released from the reservoir, and therefore, have a significant impact on the downstream flow."}, {"question": "What is the implication of changing the initial elevation of the reservoir on the peak downstream flow?", "answer": "Changing the initial elevation of the reservoir can significantly impact the peak downstream flow. For example, if the initial elevation is lowered to 2290 feet above MSL, the additional flood storage in the reservoir will reduce the peak downstream flow. This reduction in peak flow is due to the increased storage capacity of the reservoir, which attenuates the flood wave. The percentage reduction in peak flow can be calculated by comparing the peak flows for the two different initial elevations."}, {"question": "How do Manning's roughness factors affect the flow in the downstream valley?", "answer": "Manning's roughness factors, which are given as a function of water surface elevation for each cross section, affect the flow in the downstream valley by influencing the friction losses and, therefore, the flow velocity. Higher roughness factors indicate greater friction losses, resulting in lower flow velocities. The roughness factors are essential for accurately modeling the flow in the downstream valley, as they determine the hydraulic resistance and, consequently, the flow behavior."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to terminate the routing computations after a specified time period?", "answer": "Terminating the routing computations after a specified time period, such as 57 hours, is necessary because it allows the model to focus on the most critical period of the flood event. Continuing the computations beyond this time period may not provide significant additional insights, and the model may become less accurate due to the accumulation of errors. The specified time period ensures that the model captures the essential characteristics of the flood event, including the peak flow and the recession limb of the hydrograph."}, {"question": "In the context of reservoir operation, what is the significance of the normal pool level?", "answer": "The normal pool level, which is 2323 ft above MSL in this case, is the target elevation for reservoir operation. It represents the desired water level in the reservoir under normal conditions. The normal pool level is essential for reservoir management, as it determines the storage capacity available for flood control, water supply, and other purposes. Deviations from the normal pool level can indicate changes in reservoir operation or unexpected events, such as floods or droughts."}, {"question": "How does the slope of the downstream valley affect the flow behavior?", "answer": "The slope of the downstream valley, which is approximately 10.15 ft/mi, affects the flow behavior by influencing the flow velocity and the water surface profile. A steeper slope results in higher flow velocities and a more rapid decline in water surface elevation, whereas a gentler slope leads to lower flow velocities and a more gradual decline in water surface elevation. The slope of the downstream valley is essential for accurately modeling the flow behavior, as it determines the hydraulic gradient and, consequently, the flow characteristics."}]}

A wider breach base allows for a greater volume of water to be released in a shorter amount of time, potentially leading to more severe flooding downstream.

Such a process is called a stochastic process. In some cases, the random variability of the process is so large compared to its deterministic variability that the hydrologist is justified in treating the pro- cess as purely random. As such, the value of one observation of the process is not correlated with the values of adjacent observations, and the statistical properties of all observations are the same. When there is no correlation between adjacent observations, the output of a hydrologic system is treated as stochastic, space-independent, and time- independent in the classification scheme shown in Fig. 1.4.1. This type of treat- ment is appropriate for observations of extreme hydrologic events, such as floods or droughts, and for hydrologic data averaged over long time intervals, such as annual precipitation. This chapter describes hydrologic data from pure random processes using statistical parameters and functions. Statistical methods are based on mathematical principles that describe the random variation of a set of observa- tions of a process, and they focus attention on the observations themselves rather than on the physical processes which produced them. Statistics is a science of description, not causality. 11. PROBABILISTIC TREATMENT OF HYDROLOGIC DATA A random variable X is a variable described by a probability distribution. The distribution specifies the chance that an observation x of the variable will fall in 350 HYDROLOGIC statistics 351 a specified range of X. For example, if X is annual precipitation at a specified location, then the probability distribution of X specifies the chance that the observed annual precipitation in a given year will lie in a defined range, such as less than 30 in, or 30 in—40 in, and so on. A set of observations x,, x2, . . . , x, of the random variable is called a sample. It is assumed that samples are drawn from a hypothetical infinite population possessing constant statistical properties, while the properties of a sample may vary from one sample to another. The set of all possible samples that could be drawn from the population is called the sample space, and an event is a subset of the sample space (Fig. 11.1.1). For example, the sample space for annual precipitation is theoretically the range from zero to positive infinity (though the practical lower and upper limits are closer than this), and an event A might be the occurrence of annual precipitation less than some amount, such as 30 in. The probability of an event, P(A), is the chance that it will occur when an observation of the random variable is made. Probabilities of events can be estimated. If a sample of n observations has n, values in the range of event A, then the relative frequency of A is na/n. As the sample size is increased, the relative frequency becomes a progressively better estimate of the probability of the event, that is, P(A) = lim “4 (11.1.1) no N Such probabilities are called objective or posterior probabilities because they depend completely on observations of the random variable. People are accustomed to estimating the chance that a future event will occur based on their judgment and experience. Such estimates are called subjective or prior probabilities. The probabilities of events obey certain principles: 1. Total probability. If the sample space 1) is completely divided into m nonover- lapping areas or events Aj, A2, . . . , Am, then P(A+ ,P(A)2) + ... + P(A=m P()Q) = 1 (11.1.2) 2. Complementarity. It follows that if A is the complement of A, that is, A =) — A, then P(A) =ale P(A) (11,153) Sample spaceQ FIGURE 11.1.1 Events A and B are subsets of the sample space (0. 352 APPLIED HYDROLOGY 3. Conditional probability. Suppose there are two events A andB as, shown in Fig. 11.1.1. Event A might be the event that this year’s precipitation is less than 40 in, while B might be the event that next year’s precipitation will be less than 40 in. Their overlap is A MB, the event that A and B both occur, two successive years with annual precipitation less than 40 in/year. If P(B|A) is the conditional probability that B will occur given that A has already occurred, then the joint probability that A and B will both occur, P(ANMB), is the product of P(B|A) and the probability that A will occur, that is, P(A MB) = P(B|A)P(A), or « P(AN B) P(B\\A) = say 04 es (11.1.4) If the occurrence of B does not depend on the occurrence of A, the events are said to be independent, and P(B|A) = P(B). For independent events, from (11.1.4), | P(A 1 B) = P(A)P(B) (11.1.5) If, for the example cited earlier, the precipitation events are independent from year to year, then the probability that precipitation is less than 40 in in two successive years is simply the square of the probability that annual precipitation in any one year will be less than 40 in. The notion of independent events or observations is critical to the correct statistical interpretation of hydrologic data sequences, because if the data are independent they can be analyzed without regard to their order of occurrence. If successive observations are correlated (not independent), the statistical methods required are more complicated because the joint probability P(A M B) of succes- sive events is not equal to P(A)P(B). from 1911 to 1979 are shown in Table 11.1.1 and plotted as a time series in Fig. 11.1.2(a).

There are n = 79 — 11 + 1 = 69 data. Let A be the event R < 35.0 in, B the event R > 45.0 in. The numbers of values in Table 11.1.1 falling in these ranges are ng = 23 and ng = 19, so P(A) ~ 23/69 = 0.333 and P(B) ~ 19/69 = 0.275. From Eq. (11.1.3), the probability that the annual precipitation is between 35 and 45 in can now be calculated P(35.0 = R= 45.0 in)=1 — P(R < 35.0) — P(R > 45.0) = 1 — 0.333 — 0.275 =0.392 pendent process, calculate the probability that there will be two successive years of precipitation less than 35.0 in.

Probabilities estimated from sample data, as in Examples 11.1.1 and 11.1.2, are approximate, because they depend on the specific values of the observations in a sample of limited size. An alternative approach is to fit a probability distribution function to the data and then to determine the probabilities of events from this distribution function.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic statistics, what is a stochastic process, and how does it relate to hydrologic events?", "answer": "A stochastic process in hydrology refers to a process that evolves in space and time in a manner that is partly predictable (deterministic) and partly random. This means that hydrologic events, such as floods or droughts, can be influenced by both predictable patterns and unpredictable variability. Understanding stochastic processes is crucial for analyzing and predicting hydrologic phenomena, as it allows hydrologists to quantify the uncertainty associated with these events."}, {"question": "Why are statistical methods based on mathematical principles that describe the random variation of a set of observations of a process, rather than on the physical processes which produced them?", "answer": "Statistical methods in hydrology focus on the observations themselves because the physical processes that generate hydrologic data can be complex and not fully understood. By analyzing the statistical properties of the observations, hydrologists can infer characteristics of the underlying processes without needing a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms. This approach enables the development of predictive models and the estimation of probabilities of future events, which is essential for water resource management and planning."}, {"question": "In the context of probabilistic treatment of hydrologic data, what is the difference between objective and subjective probabilities?", "answer": "Objective probabilities, also known as posterior probabilities, are estimated from observations of the random variable and depend completely on the data. In contrast, subjective probabilities, or prior probabilities, are based on judgment and experience. Objective probabilities become more accurate as the sample size increases, whereas subjective probabilities reflect personal beliefs or expertise and can vary significantly between individuals."}, {"question": "How do hydrologists determine the probability of an event, such as annual precipitation being less than a certain amount, from a set of observations?", "answer": "Hydrologists determine the probability of an event by calculating the relative frequency of the event in the sample data. For example, if a sample of n observations has nA values in the range of the event A, then the relative frequency of A is nA/n. As the sample size increases, the relative frequency becomes a progressively better estimate of the probability of the event. This method is based on the principle that the probability of an event is equal to the limit of the relative frequency as the sample size approaches infinity."}, {"question": "What is the concept of independence in hydrologic data sequences, and why is it critical for statistical interpretation?", "answer": "Independence in hydrologic data sequences means that the occurrence of one event does not depend on the occurrence of another event. This concept is critical because if the data are independent, they can be analyzed without regard to their order of occurrence, simplifying statistical analysis. However, if successive observations are correlated (not independent), more complex statistical methods are required to account for the dependence between events. Understanding independence is essential for accurately estimating probabilities and making predictions in hydrology."}, {"question": "In the context of the Teton Dam application, why is it important to perform a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters?", "answer": "Performing a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, such as the final bottom width and side slope of the breach, and the maximum time to failure, is important because it allows hydrologists to understand how changes in these parameters affect the simulated flood elevation and other outcomes. This analysis is crucial for identifying the most critical parameters and for evaluating the robustness of the simulation results. By varying these parameters and comparing the results, hydrologists can better understand the uncertainties associated with the simulation and make more informed decisions."}, {"question": "How does the concept of conditional probability apply to hydrologic events, such as the occurrence of precipitation less than a certain amount in two successive years?", "answer": "Conditional probability is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In the context of hydrologic events, conditional probability can be used to estimate the likelihood of consecutive events, such as two years of precipitation less than a certain amount. This is done by multiplying the probability of the first event by the conditional probability of the second event given that the first event has occurred. Understanding conditional probability is essential for predicting the likelihood of extreme hydrologic events and for managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "What are the implications of treating hydrologic processes as purely random, and how does this approach simplify the analysis of hydrologic data?", "answer": "Treating hydrologic processes as purely random simplifies the analysis by allowing hydrologists to focus on the statistical properties of the observations rather than the complex underlying physical processes. This approach enables the use of statistical methods to estimate probabilities and predict future events, which is particularly useful for extreme events like floods or droughts. However, it also means that the deterministic components of the processes are neglected, which can lead to oversimplification and potential errors in prediction and decision-making. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the appropriateness of this approach for each specific application and to consider the potential limitations and uncertainties."}]}
{"paragraph": "11.2 FREQUENCY AND PROBABILITY FUNCTIONS If the observations in a sample are identically distributed (each sample value drawn from the same probability distribution), they can be arranged to form a frequency histogram. First, the feasible range of the random variable is divided into discrete intervals, then the number of observations falling into each interval is counted, and finally the result is plotted as a bar graph, as shown in Fig. 11.1.2(b) for annual precipitation in College Station. The width Ax of the interval used in setting up the frequency histogram is chosen to be as small as possible while still having sufficient observations falling into each interval for the histogram to have a reasonably smooth variation over the range of the data. If the number of observations n; in interval i, covering the range [x; — Ax, x;], is divided by the total number of observations n, the result is called the relative frequency function f (x): filx;) = (11.2.1) n which, as in Eq. (11.1.1), is an estimate of P(x; — Ax = X S x;), the probability that the random variable X will lie in the interval [x; — Ax, x;]. The subscript s indicates that the function is calculated from sample data. The sum of the values of the relative frequencies up to a given point is the cumulative frequency function F,(x): Ficay => hea) (11.2.2) i) This is an estimate of P(X = x;), the cumulative probability of x;. The relative frequency and cumulative frequency functions are defined for a sample; corresponding functions for the population are approached as limits as n—> © and Ax — 0.

From the point of view of fitting sample data to a theoretical distribution, the four functions—relative frequency f(x) and cumulative frequency F (x) for the sample, and probability distribution F(x) and probability density f(x) for the populationma—y be arranged in a cycle as shown in Fig. 11.2.1. Beginning in the upper left panel, (a), the relative frequency function is computed from the sample data divided into intervals, and accumulated to form the cumulative frequency function shown at the lower left, (b). The probability distribution function, at the lower right, (c), is the theoretical limit of the cumulative frequency function as the sample size becomes infinitely large and the data interval infinitely small. The probability density function, at the upper right, (d), is the value of the slope of the distribution function for a specified value of x.

STATISTICAL PARAMETERS The objective of statistics is to extract the essential information from a set of data, reducing a large set of numbers to a small set of numbers. Statistics are numbers calculated from a sample which summarize its important characteristics. Statistical parameters are characteristics of a population, such as yw and a in Eq. (19.228); A statistical parameter is the expected value E of some function of a random variable. A simple parameter is the mean p, the expected value of the random variable itself. For a random variable X, the mean is E(X), calculated as the product of x and the corresponding probability density f(x), integrated over the feasible range of the random variable: E(X) = w= I x f(x) dx Glibs3 41!) E(X) is the first moment about the origin of the random variable, a measure of the midpoint or “central tendency” of the distribution. The sample estimate of the mean is the average x of the sample data: x=- Xj Cliless2) sample statistics. 360 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Population parameters and sample statistics Population parameter Sample statistic 1.

The variance has dimensions [X]?. The standard deviation o is a measure of variability having the same dimensions as X. The quantity o is the square root of the variance, and is estimated by s. The significance of the standard deviation is illustrated in Fig. 11.3.1(a); the larger the standard deviation, the larger is the spread of the data.

{"paragraph": "11.4 FITTING A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION A probability distribution is a function representing the probability of occurrence of a random variable. By fitting a distribution to a set of hydrologic data, a great deal of the probabilistic information in the sample can be compactly summarized in the function and its associated parameters. Fitting distributions can be accom- plished by the method of moments or the method of maximum likelihood. Method of Moments The method of moments was first developed by Karl Pearson in 1902. He consid- ered that good estimates of the parameters of a probability distribution are those for which moments of the probability density function about the origin are equal to the corresponding moments of the sample data. As shown in Fig. 11.4.1, if the data values are each assigned a hypothetical “mass” equal to their relative frequency of occurrence (1/n) and it is imagined that this system of masses is rotated about the origin x = 0, then the first moment of each observation x; about the origin is the product of its moment arm x; and its mass I/n, and the sum of these moments over all the daSta aiss s Saes n n i=] i=] 364 APPLIED HYDROLOGY al( x) S fxf (x)dx (first moment about the origin) Ae —oco f(x)d x = \"mass\" +— , >| x Moment arm (a) Probability density function. n 7S 3 Hep (first moment about the origin) “HP Moment arm (b) Sampie data. FIGURE 11.4.1 The method of moments selects values for the parameters of the probability density function so that its moments are equal to those of the sample data. the sample mean. This is equivalent to the centroid of a body. The corresponding centroid of the probability density function is b= [xp a (11.4.1) Likewise, the second and third moments of the probability distribution can be set equal to their sample values to determine the values of parameters of the probability distribution. Pearson originally considered only moments about the origin, but later it became customary to use the variance as the second central moment, o? = E[(x—)?], and the coefficient of skewness as the standardized third central moment, y = E[(x — «)*]/o°, to determine second and third parameters of the distribution if required. kinds of hydrologic data, such as the interarrival times of rainfall events. Its HYDROLOGIC statistics 365 probability density function is f(x) = Ae~* for x > 0. Determine the relationship between the parameter A and the first moment about the origin, p. Solution. Using Eq. (11.4.1), = E(Qx)= | Xf (x) dx = | xhe\"™* dx 0 which may be integrated by parts to yield w= >I In this case A = 1/y, and the sample estimate for A is 1x/ . As a matter of interest, it can be seen that the exponential probability density function f(x) = Ae~* and the impulse response function for a linear reservoir (see Ex. 7.2.1) u(1) = (1/ke~\"* are identical if x = / and A = 1/k. In this sense, the exponential distribution can be thought of as describing the probability of the “holding time” of water in a linear reservoir. Method of Maximum Likelihood The method of maximum likelihood was developed by R. A. Fisher (1922). He reasoned that the best value of a parameter of a probability distribution should be that value which maximizes the likelihood or joint probability of occurrence of the observed sample. Suppose that the sample space is divided into intervals of length dx and that a sample of independent and identically distributed observations x, xX, ... , X, is taken. The value of the probability density for X = x; is f(x;), and the probability that the random variable will occur in the interval including x; is f(x;) dx. Since the observations are independent, their joint probability of occurrence is given from Eq. (11.1.5) as the product f(x) dxf (x2) dx... f(xp) dx = [Il ;_, f(;)] dx\", and since the interval size dx is fixed, maximizing the joint probability of the observed sample is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function L =|] fe) (11.4.2) i=1 Because many probability density functions are exponential, it is sometimes more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function InL= > In [f(x] (11.4.3) i=] 366 APPLIED HYDROLOGY at a given location. Assuming that the interarrival time of rainfall events follows an exponential distribution, determine the parameter A for this process by the method of maximum likelihood. The times between rainfalls (days) are: 2.40, 4.25, 0.77, 13.32, 3.55/and 1.37. Solution. For a given value x;, the exponential probability density is f(xi) = Ae so, from Eq. (11.4.3), the log-likelihood function is InL= > In f@)) i=1 = S In (Ae) i=] = Sana — Xx;) i=l =p mA e i=1 The maximum value of In L occurs when o(1n L)/dA = 0; that is, when iN ape nne Sash Or A 7 so lis jer i=1 A=—1 x This is the same sample estimator for A as was produced by the method of moments. In this case, x = (2.40 + 4.25 + 0.77 + 13.22 + 3.55 + 1.37)/6 = 25.56/6 = 4.28 days, so A = 1/4.28 = 0.234 day!. Note that 07(In L)/dA? = —nA?, which is negative as required for a maximum. The value of the log-likelihood function can be calculated for any value of X. For example, for A = 0.234 day~!, the value of the log-likelihood function is In L=nIn M=AD x; i=1 =6 In (0.234) — 0.234 x 25.56 =~14.70 HYDROLOGIC STATISTICS 367 -14.6 -14.8 -15.0 15:2 -15.4 -15.6 \\ InL=nInaA- AQ x; i -15.8 Maximum = 6InA - 25.6A Log—likelihood likelihood -16.0 estimate \\ ~16.2 of A A= 0.234 ! 164 Sa ial i 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 r (days ') FIGURE 11.4.2 The log-likelihood function for an exponential distribution (Example 11.4.2). Figure 11.4.2 shows the variation of the log-likelihood function with A, with the maximum value at A = 0.234 day! as was determined analytically. The method of maximum likelihood is the most theoretically correct method of fitting probability distributions to data in the sense that it produces the most efficient parameter estimates—those which estimate the population parameters with the least average error. But, for some probability distributions, there is no analytical solution for all the parameters in terms of sample statistics, and the log-likelihood function must then be numerically maximized, which may be quite difficult. In general, the method of moments is easier to apply than the method of maximum likelihood and is more suitable for practical hydrologic analysis. Testing the Goodness of Fit The goodness of fit of a probability distribution can be tested by comparing the theoretical and sample values of the relative frequency or the cumulative frequency function. In the case of the relative frequency function, the x? test is used. The sample value of the relative frequency of interval i is, from Eq. (11.2.1), f;(x;) = nj/n; the theoretical value from (11.2.7) is p(x;) = F(x;) — F(x;-,). The x? test statistic x2 is given by = 2 Vv ue 23 nlf (xi) — pQ)I (11.4.4) i=l P(x;) where m is the number of intervals. It may be noted that nf(x;) = nj, the observed number of occurrences in interval 7, and np(x;) is the corresponding expected number of occurrences in interval 7; so the calculation of Eq. (11.4.4) is a matter of squaring the difference between the observed and expected numbers 368 APPLIED HYDROLOGY of occurrences, dividing by the expected number of occurrences in the interval,. and summing the result over all intervals. To describe the y’ test, the x” probability distribution must be defined. A x’ distribution with v degrees of freedom is the distribution for the sum of squares of v independent standard normal random variables z;; this sum is the random variable S nipped (11.4.5) i=1 The y distribution function is tabulated in many statistics texts (e.g., Haan, 1977). In the x test, v= m—p-— 1, where m is the number of intervals as before, and p is the number of parameters used in fitting the proposed distribution. A confidence level is chosen for the test; it is often expressed as 1 — a, where a is termed the significance level. A typical value for the confidence level is 95 percent. The null hypothesis for the test is that the proposed probability distribution fits the data adequately. This hypothesis is rejected (i.e., the fit is deemed inadequate) if the value of ie in (11.4.4) is larger than a limiting value, X,.1-q determined from the x* distribution with v degrees of freedom as the value having cumulative probability 1 — a. annual precipitation at College Station, Texas, from 1911 to 1979 (Table 11.1.1).

This method differs from the method of moments in that it is based on the idea of maximizing the probability of the observed data, rather than equating moments. The method of maximum likelihood is considered to be more theoretically correct and produces more efficient parameter estimates, but it can be more difficult to apply in practice, especially for complex distributions."}, {"question": "In the context of testing the goodness of fit of a probability distribution, what is the purpose of the x^2 test, and how is it used to determine whether a distribution adequately fits the data?", "answer": "The x^2 test is a statistical test used to determine whether a probability distribution adequately fits the data by comparing the theoretical and sample values of the relative frequency or cumulative frequency function. The test statistic x^2 is calculated by summing the squared differences between the observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequencies. The null hypothesis that the proposed distribution fits the data adequately is rejected if the value of x^2 is larger than a limiting value determined from the x^2 distribution with v degrees of freedom.

This adjustment is necessary because the use of parameters in fitting the distribution reduces the number of independent observations, and therefore the degrees of freedom. The implication of this is that the x^2 test becomes more conservative as the number of parameters increases, requiring a larger value of x^2 to reject the null hypothesis.

A poor fit can have significant implications, including incorrect predictions and decisions, and can lead to errors in risk assessment and management. Furthermore, a poor fit can indicate that the underlying assumptions of the distribution are not met, or that the data is not representative of the population. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the goodness of fit and select a distribution that adequately represents the data, to ensure reliable and accurate results in hydrologic analysis and modeling."}]}

{"paragraph": "11.5 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR HYDROLOGIC VARIABLES In Sec. 11.4, the normal distribution was used to describe annual precipitation at College Station, Texas. Although this distribution fits this set of data particularly well, observations of other hydrologic variables follow different distributions. In this section, a selection of probability distributions commonly used for hydrologic variables is presented, and examples of the types of variables to which these distributions have been applied are given. Table 11.5.1 summarizes, for each distribution, the probability density function and the range of the variable, and gives equations for estimating the distribution’s parameters from sample moments. Normal Distribution The normal distribution arises from the central limit theorem, which states that if a sequence of random variables X; are independently and identically distributed with mean p and variance o”, then the distribution of the sum of n such random variables, Y = 2 ave X;, tends towards the normal distribution with mean ny and variance no as n becomes large. The important point is that this is true no matter what the probability distribution function of X is. So, for example, the probability distribution of the sample mean x = 1/n > ;_,x; can be approximated as normal with mean p and variance (1/n)*no? = o/n no matter what the distribution of x is. Hydrologic variables, such as annual precipitation, calculated as the sum of the effects of many independent events tend to follow the normal distribution. The main limitations of the normal distribution for describing hydrologic variables are that it varies over a continuous range [—%, ©], while most hydrologic variables are nonnegative, and that it is symmetric about the mean, while hydrologic data tend to be skewed. Lognormal Distribution If the random variable Y = log X is normally distributed, then X is said to be lognormally distributed. Chow (1954) reasoned that this distribution is applicable to hydrologic variables formed as the products of other variables since if X = XXX; ... Xn, then -Y =log X = > f-, log X; = 2 ;.,Y;, which tends to the normal distribution for large n provided that the X; are independent and identically distributed. The lognormal distribution has been found to describe the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in a porous medium (Freeze, 1975), siagjawieied 103 suoyenby Juaastoyju }ld iSua}r)Ue SsU IOUL S x S * < y w - 0 o 0 = * % 0 = * e s u ) R a a B j y = e 7 p d I d — — u o 0 j o 1 p A y s u z y 1 0 J x | ) I d x a = = u ( x ! f L U T N O o l o e a . é \\ “ o z 7 NOx x 3 = 0 A a ] r o y m = V ( w N O i S g | V - x g y * ? = ( _ — f f — — ( A n o u n j e u n u e s = | 0 4 M S U uAAyojinqsiouquaenpqy o ig O H N G L S I P A y u I o f UATS q e q o 1 g aTV L H N q L y s I G j e u u o N jewuous07] e n u o u o d x g euUUIey) 372 d e e s aa u S s i a j u r e s (2antsod d j 3) e a z e a s u o n1 e0 n3 b y suisaJ ) o ay) s } U d U I O U I 5 E= e n¢ e ) g*s R — e. x I f ( : 4 > - | — ‘ A s r S ( si u 4 i ) u 5 n ss*es) u g ey a ut =Y =9 =2 = 27 = e ]x e 3 0 y d I d o j o ry pedpA S e u o y o u n y ( @ - x ) y - 7 1 - g ? @ - “ y - ? | - g ( ? s u o N1N0 Jq I y S I 3p u N z Y E R t e s A y p q e q oAiygI s u a p N g— ¥ ( o= f ( I g — y ( X f= ( i x o I o€y m= = Sox]X A T A V L S I T ( 7 4 0 9 ) A W I q e q o 1 g E e u O N N g L y s i g u o s r e a g edAy,Ti ] 3e1y)) Jojourered ( e w w e s 307] u o s I e a g o d yI l s W e n x y T aNnfeA o dJA y 373 374 APPLIED HYDROLOGY the distribution of raindrop sizes in a storm, and other hydrologic variables. The lognormal distribution has the advantages over the normal distribution that it is bounded (X > 0) and that the log transformation tends to reduce the positive skewness commonly found in hydrologic data, because taking logarithms reduces large numbers proportionately more than it does small numbers. Some limitations of the lognormal distribution are that it has only two parameters and that it requires the logarithms of the data to be symmetric about their mean. Exponential Distribution Some sequences of hydrologic events, such as the occurrence of precipitation, may. be considered Poisson processes, in which events occur instantaneously and independently on a time horizon, or along a line. The time between such events, or interarrival time, is described by the exponential distribution whose parameter A is the mean rate of occurrence of the events. The exponential distribution is used to describe the interarrival times of random shocks to hydrologic systems, such as slugs of polluted runoff entering streams as rainfall washes the pollutants off the land surface. The advantage of the exponential distribution is that it is easy to estimate A from observed data and the exponential distribution lends itself well to theoretical studies, such as a probability model for the linear reservoir (A = I/k, where k is the storage constant in the linear reservoir). Its disadvantage is that it requires the occurrence of each event to be completely independent of its neighbors, which may not be a valid assumption for the process under study— for example, the arrival of a front may generate many showers of rain—and this has led investigators to study various forms of compound Poisson processes, in which A is considered a random variable instead of a constant (Kavvas and Delleur, 1981; Waymire and Gupta, 1981). Gamma Distribution The time taken for a number B of events to occur in a Poisson process is described by the gamma distribution, which is the distribution of a sum of B independent and identical exponentially distributed random variables. The gamma distribution has a smoothly varying form like the typical probability density function illustrated in Fig. 11.2.1 and is useful for describing skewed hydrologic variables without the need for log transformation. It has been applied to describe the distribution of depth of precipitation in storms, for example. The gamma distribution involves the gamma function I(B), which is given by '(B) =(B—1)! =(B—1)(B—2). . .3+2+1 for positive integer B, and in general by T(B) = [wed (11.5.1) (Abramowitz ae Stegun, 1965). The two-parameter gamma distribution (param- eters 8 and A) has a lower bound at zero, which is a disadvantage for application to hydrologic variables that have a lower bound larger than zero. HYDROLOGIC sTATisTics 375 Pearson Type III Distribution The Pearson Type III distribution, also called the three-parameter gamma distri- bution, introduces a third parameter, the lower bound e, so that by the method of moments, three sample moments (the mean, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of skewness) can be transformed into the three parameters A, B, and € of the probability distribution. This is a very flexible distribution, assuming a number of different shapes as A, B, and € vary (Bobee and Robitaille, 1977). The Pearson system of distributions includes seven types; they are all solutions for f(x) in an equation of the form dfx) f@e-@ CL 2) ~dx Co ata C\\x ae Cx? where d is the mode of the distribution (the value of x for which f(x) is a maximum) and Co, C, and C2 are coefficients to be determined. When C> = 0, the solution of (11.5.2) is a Pearson Type III distribution, having a probability density function of the form shown in Table 11.5.1. For C; = C2 = 0, a normal distribution is the solution of (11.5.2). Thus, the normal distribution is a special case of the Pearson Type III distribution, describing a nonskewed variable. The Pearson Type III distribution was first applied in hydrology by Foster (1924) to describe the probability distribution of annual maximum flood peaks. When the data are very positively skewed, a log transformation is used to reduce the skewness. Log—Pearson Type III Distribution If log X follows a Pearson Type III distribution, then X is said to follow a log—Pearson Type III distribution. This distribution is the standard distribution for frequency analysis of annual maximum floods in the United States (Benson, 1968), and its use is described in detail in Chap. 12. As a special case, when log X is symmetric about its mean, the log—Pearson Type III distribution reduces to the lognormal distribution. The location of the bound € in the log—Pearson Type III distribution depends on the skewness of the data. If the data are positively skewed, then log X = € and Shape and mode location of the log—Pearson Type III distribution as a function of its parameters Shape parameter B A < —In 10 —In 10 <A<0 A> 0 0 =) Cia No mode Minimum mode No mode J-shaped U-shaped Reverse J-shaped B>1 Unimodal No mode Unimodal Reverse J-shaped Source: Bobee, 1975. 376 APPLIED HYDROLOGY € is a lower bound, while if the data are negatively skewed, log X S € and € is an upper bound. The log transformation reduces the skewness of the transformed data and may produce transformed data which are negatively skewed from original data which are positively skewed. In that case, the application of the log—Pearson Type III distribution would impose an artificial upper bound on the data. Depending on the values of the parameters, the log—Pearson Type III distribution can assume many different shapes, as shown in Table 11.5.2 (Bobee, 1975). As described previously, the log—Pearson Type III distribution was devel- oped as a method of fitting a curve to data. Its use is justified by the fact that it has been found to yield good resultsi i n many applications, particularly ees flood peak data. The fit of the distribution to data can be checked using the x? test, or by using probability plotting as described in Chap. 12. Extreme Value Distribution Extreme values are selected maximum or minimum values of sets of data. For example, the annual maximum discharge at a given location is the largest recorded discharge value during a year, and the annual maximum discharge values for each year of historical record make up a set of extreme values that can be analyzed statistically. Distributions of the extreme values selected from sets of samples of any probability distribution have been shown by Fisher and Tippett (1928) to converge to one of three forms of extreme value distributions, called Types I, II, and III, respectively, when the number of selected extreme values is large. The properties of the three limiting forms were further developed by Gumbel (1941) for the Extreme Value Type I (EVI) distribution, Frechet (1927) for the Extreme Value Type II (EVII), and Weibull (1939) for the Extreme Value Type I (EVI). The three limiting forms were shown by Jenkinson (1955) to be special cases of a single distribution called the General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The probability distribution function for the GEV is F(x) = exp l-(1n r— 1/k | (11.5.3) where k, u, and @ are parameters to be determined. The three limiting cases are (1) for k = 0, the Extreme Value Type I distribution, for which the probability density function is given in Table 11.5.1, (2) for k < 0, the Extreme Value Type II distribution, for which (11.5.3) applies for (u + a/k) = x S ©, and (3) for k > 0, the Extreme Value Type III distribution, for which (11.5.3) applies for -© =< x S (u + a/k). In all three cases, @ is assumed to be positive. For the EVI distribution x is unbounded (Table 11.5.1), while for EVII, x is bounded from below (by u + a/k), and for the EVIII distribution, x is similarly bounded from above. The EVI and EVII distributions are also known as the Gumbel and Frechet distributions, respectively. If a variable x is described by the EVIII distribution, then —x is said to have a Weibull distribution. HYDROLOGIC STATISTICS 377 REFERENCES Abramowitz, M., and I. A.

This discrepancy makes the normal distribution less suitable for many hydrologic applications. Furthermore, hydrologic data tend to exhibit positive skewness, which the normal distribution cannot capture. As a result, alternative distributions such as the lognormal, exponential, and gamma distributions are often employed to better model hydrologic phenomena."}, {"question": "How do lognormal distributions address the limitations of normal distributions in describing hydrologic variables?", "answer": "Lognormal distributions address the limitations of normal distributions by providing a bounded distribution (X > 0) that can capture the positive skewness commonly found in hydrologic data. The log transformation in lognormal distributions reduces large numbers proportionately more than small numbers, thereby reducing the positive skewness. This makes lognormal distributions particularly useful for describing variables such as hydraulic conductivity in porous media and the distribution of raindrop sizes in storms."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation events, what is the role of the exponential distribution, and what are its advantages and limitations?", "answer": "The exponential distribution is used to describe the interarrival times of random shocks to hydrologic systems, such as the time between precipitation events. Its advantage lies in its simplicity, allowing for easy estimation of its parameter (the mean rate of occurrence) from observed data. However, a significant limitation is the assumption that each event must be completely independent of its neighbors, which may not always be valid. This has led to the development of compound Poisson processes, where the rate of occurrence is considered a random variable."}, {"question": "Why are extreme value distributions important in hydrology, and what are the three limiting forms of these distributions?", "answer": "Extreme value distributions are crucial in hydrology for analyzing and predicting rare events such as floods and droughts. The three limiting forms of extreme value distributions are the Extreme Value Type I (EVI), Type II (EVII), and Type III (EVIII) distributions. These distributions are important because they describe the behavior of maximum or minimum values selected from large datasets, providing a statistical framework for understanding and predicting extreme hydrologic events."}, {"question": "How does the log-Pearson Type III distribution differ from the Pearson Type III distribution, and what are its applications in hydrology?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution differs from the Pearson Type III distribution in that it applies to variables whose logarithms follow a Pearson Type III distribution. This distribution is particularly useful in hydrology for frequency analysis of annual maximum floods, as it can accommodate a wide range of skewness values and can be fitted to data using the method of moments. Its flexibility and ability to model a variety of shapes make it a standard distribution for such analyses in the United States."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic statistics, what is the significance of the General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, and how does it relate to the Extreme Value Type I, II, and III distributions?", "answer": "The General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is significant because it encompasses the Extreme Value Type I, II, and III distributions as special cases, depending on the value of its shape parameter. The GEV distribution provides a unified framework for modeling extreme values, allowing for the analysis of a wide range of hydrologic phenomena, from unbounded extreme values (EVI) to bounded ones (EVII and EVIII). This versatility makes the GEV distribution a powerful tool in hydrologic statistics for predicting and understanding extreme events."}, {"question": "Why is the choice of probability distribution important in hydrologic analysis, and how do different distributions impact the interpretation of hydrologic data?", "answer": "The choice of probability distribution is crucial in hydrologic analysis because different distributions can significantly impact the interpretation of hydrologic data and the prediction of future events. Each distribution has its assumptions and limitations, and selecting an inappropriate distribution can lead to inaccurate predictions and misunderstandings of hydrologic phenomena. For instance, using a distribution that does not account for skewness can result in underestimation or overestimation of extreme events, highlighting the need for careful selection based on the characteristics of the data and the context of the analysis."}, {"question": "How do the properties of hydrologic variables, such as skewness and boundedness, influence the selection of a suitable probability distribution for analysis?", "answer": "The properties of hydrologic variables, including skewness and boundedness, play a critical role in selecting a suitable probability distribution. For example, variables that are positively skewed and bounded from below (e.g., precipitation amounts) may be better represented by distributions like the lognormal or gamma distribution, which can capture these characteristics.

By comparing these estimates, one can assess whether the chosen method of estimation (maximum likelihood in this case) provides results that are consistent with another established method (moment estimation), thereby validating the approach and increasing confidence in the results."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological data analysis, how does the choice of estimation method (e.g., maximum likelihood vs. moment estimation) impact the interpretation of precipitation data?", "answer": "The choice of estimation method can significantly impact the interpretation of precipitation data because different methods can yield different estimates of the distribution parameters. For instance, maximum likelihood estimation is often preferred for its ability to provide efficient estimates, especially for large datasets, but it requires the specification of a distribution type. On the other hand, moment estimation can be more straightforward to apply but might not always provide the best fit, especially if the assumed distribution does not accurately represent the data.

By accurately estimating the parameters of the distribution (mean and variance), researchers can better understand the central tendency and dispersion of precipitation data. This understanding is crucial for assessing precipitation variability, which is a key factor in hydrology, influencing everything from water supply management to flood control.

The magnitude of an extreme event is inversely related to its frequency of occurrence, very severe events occurring less frequently than more moderate events. The objective of frequency analysis of hydrologic data is to relate the magnitude of extreme events to their frequency of occurrence through the use of probability distributions. The hydrologic data analyzed are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, and the hydrologic system producing them (e.g., a storm rainfall system) is considered to be stochastic, space-independent, and time-independent in the classification scheme shown in Fig. 1.4.1. The hydrologic data employed should be carefully selected so that the assumptions of independence and identical distribution are satisfied. In prac- tice, this is often achieved by selecting the annual maximum of the variable being analyzed (e.g., the annual maximum discharge, which is the largest instantaneous peak flow occurring at any time during the year) with the expectation that suc- cessive observations of this variable from year to year will be independent.

FREQUENCY ANALYSIS 383 What is the probability that a 7-year return period event will occur at least once in N years? To calculate this, first consider the situation where no T-year event occurs in N years. This would require a sequence of N successive “failures,” so that P(X < xr each year for N years) = (1 — py The complement of this situation is the case required, so by (11.1.3) P(X = xr at least once in N years) = 1 — (1 — p)” (12.1.3) Since p = 1/T, N P(X = xr at least once in N years) = 1 — (= 4 (12.1.4) on the Guadalupe River will exceed 50,000 cfs at least once during the next three years. Solution. From the discussion above, P(Q = 50,000 cfs in any year) ~ 0,195, so from Eq. (12.1.3) es P(Q = 50,000 cfs at least once during the next 3 years) = 1 — (1 — 0.195)? =0.48 The problem in Example 12.1.1 could have been phrased, “What is the probability that the discharge on the Guadalupe River will exceed 50,000 cfs at least once during the next three years?” The calculation given used only the annual maximum data, but, alternatively, all exceedences of 50,000 cfs contained in the Guadalupe River record could have been considered. This set of data is called the partial duration series. It will contain more than the nine exceedences shown in Table 12.1.2 if there were two or more exceedences of 50,000 cfs within some single year of record. Hydrologic Data Series A complete duration series consists of all the data available as shown in Fig. 12.1.2(a). A partial duration series is a series of data which are selected so that their magnitude is greater than a predefined base value. If the base value is selected so that the number of values in the series is equal to the number of years of the record, the series is called an annual exceedence series; an example is shown in Fig. 12.1.2(b). An extreme value series includes the largest or smallest values occurring in each of the equally-long time intervals of the record. The time interval length is usually taken as one year, and a series so selected is called an annual series. Using largest annual values, it is an annual maximum series as shown in Fig. 12.1.2(c).

As a result, it is usually better to use the annual maximum series for analysis. In any case, as the return period of the event being considered becomes large, the results from the two approaches become very similar because the chance that two such events will occur within any year is very small.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic data series, what is the difference between an annual exceedence series and an annual maximum series?", "answer": "An annual exceedence series includes all data values greater than a predefined base value, while an annual maximum series consists of the largest values occurring in each time interval, usually a year. This distinction is crucial because the annual exceedence series may include multiple values from a single year if they exceed the base value, whereas the annual maximum series only considers the largest value per year. The choice between these series can affect the analysis, particularly in how events are counted and their return periods calculated."}, {"question": "Why is the return period of an event defined as the average recurrence interval between events equalling or exceeding a specified magnitude?", "answer": "The return period is defined this way because it provides a statistical measure of how often an event of a certain magnitude or greater is expected to occur. This definition is based on the concept of expected value, which averages out the recurrence intervals over a large number of occurrences. By using the average recurrence interval, the return period gives a long-term view of the frequency of extreme events, helping in planning and risk assessment."}, {"question": "How does the probability of occurrence of an event in any observation relate to its return period?", "answer": "The probability of occurrence of an event in any observation is the inverse of its return period. This relationship is expressed as P(X = x7) = 1/T, where P(X = x7) is the probability of the event occurring and T is the return period. This inverse relationship means that events with shorter return periods have higher probabilities of occurrence, and vice versa. Understanding this relationship is essential for predicting and preparing for extreme hydrologic events."}, {"question": "In the context of frequency analysis, why might the annual maximum series be preferred over the annual exceedence series for certain analyses?", "answer": "The annual maximum series is often preferred because it ensures that the observations are independent, which is a crucial assumption for many statistical analyses. The annual exceedence series, on the other hand, may include events that are not independent, such as multiple floods in a single year that are related to the same underlying conditions. By using the annual maximum series, analysts can avoid issues related to event dependence, leading to more reliable results, especially for events with long return periods."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the relationship between the return period of an event derived from an annual exceedence series and one derived from an annual maximum series, as given by the formula Tg = T / (1 + 1/n)?", "answer": "The implication of this relationship is that for large return periods, the results from both series become very similar because the chance of two such events occurring within any year is very small. However, for smaller return periods, the difference between Tg and T can be significant, affecting the analysis and planning based on these events. This relationship highlights the importance of considering the type of data series used in frequency analysis and its impact on the results, particularly for events with shorter return periods."}, {"question": "How does the concept of return period help in understanding and managing hydrologic risks?", "answer": "The concept of return period is crucial for understanding and managing hydrologic risks because it provides a quantitative measure of the likelihood of extreme events. By knowing the return period of an event, planners and managers can assess the risk associated with that event and make informed decisions about infrastructure design, flood protection measures, and emergency preparedness. The return period helps in balancing the costs of protection measures against the potential consequences of the event, thereby aiding in the allocation of resources for risk mitigation and management."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic data analysis, what is the significance of the power series expansion in deriving the relationship between the return period and the probability of occurrence?", "answer": "The power series expansion is significant because it allows for the derivation of the relationship E(T) = 1/p, where E(T) is the expected value of the return period and p is the probability of occurrence. This relationship is fundamental in hydrology as it connects the statistical properties of extreme events with their recurrence intervals, enabling the calculation of return periods from observed data. The use of the power series expansion in this context demonstrates the application of mathematical tools to understand complex hydrologic phenomena."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the independence of observations in hydrologic data series?", "answer": "Considering the independence of observations is important because many statistical analyses assume that the data points are independent. In hydrology, the occurrence of one event can influence the likelihood of another (e.g., soil saturation from one flood affecting the impact of a subsequent flood). If observations are not independent, this can lead to biased results in frequency analysis and risk assessment. Ensuring independence, such as by using the annual maximum series, helps to maintain the validity of statistical inferences and the reliability of hydrologic predictions."}]}
{"paragraph": "12.2 EXTREME VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS The study of extreme hydrologic events involves the selection of a sequence of the largest or smallest observations from sets of data. For example, the study of peak flows uses just the largest flow recorded each year at a gaging station out of the many thousands of values recorded. In fact, water level is usually recorded every 15 minutes, so there are 4 x 24 = 96 values recorded each day, 386 APPLIED HYDROLOGY and 365 X 96 = 35,040 values recorded each year; so the annual maximum flow event used for flood flow frequency analysis is the largest of more than 35,000 observations during that year. And this exercise is carried out for each year of historical data. : Since these observations are located in the extreme tail of the probability distribution of all observations from which they are drawn (the parent population), it is not surprising that their probability distribution is different from that of the parent population. As described in Sec. 11.5, there are three asymptotic forms of the distributions of extreme values, named Type I, Type II, and Type III, respectively. The Extreme Value Type I (EVI) probability distribution function is F(x) = exp|-exp(-2—)| -esx=m G1 2221)) The parameters are estimated, as given in Table 1].5.1, by V6s (12.2.2) a= T u=x — 0.57720 (12.2.3) The parameter u is the mode of the distribution (point of maximum probability density). A reduced variate y can be defined as Ee 12.2.4 y A (12.2.4) Substituting the reduced variate into (12.2.1) yields F(x) = exp [—exp(—y) ] (12.275) Solving for y: y = -In|in fFQs) | (12.2.6) Let (12.2.6) be used to define y for the Type II and Type III distributions. The values of x and y can be plotted as shown in Fig. 12.2.1. For the EVI distribution the plot is a straight line while, for large values of y, the corresponding curve for the EVII distribution slopes more steeply than for EVI, and the curve for the EVIII distribution slopes less steeply, being bounded from above. Figure 12.2.1 also shows values of the return period T as an alternate axis to y. As shown by Eq.

(12.2.4), or Xr =u + aYT (12.2.8) Extreme value distributions have been widely used in hydrology. They form the basis for the standardized method of flood frequency analysis in Great Britain (Natural Environment Research Council, 1975). Storm rainfalls are most commonly modeled by the Extreme Value Type I distribution (Chow, 1953; Tomlinson, 1980), and drought flows by the Weibull distribution, that is, the EVIII distribution applied to —x (Gumbel, 1954, 1963). Chicago, Illinois, from 1913 to 1947 are presented in Table 12.2.1. Develop a model for storm rainfall frequency analysis using the Extreme Value Type I distri- bution and calculate the 5-, 10-, and 50-year return period maximum values of 10- minute rainfall at Chicago. Solution. The sample moments calculated from the data in Table 12.2.1 are x = 0.649 in and s = 0.177 in. Substituting into Eqs. (12.2.2) and (12.2.3) yields V6s a= 7 388 APPLIED HYDROLOGY _ v6 x 0.177 7 =0.138 u=x — 0.5772a =0.649 — 0.5772 Xx 0.138 =0.569 The probability model is F(x) = exp |-e xe(-252.52)| 0.138 To determine the values of x7 for various values of return period T, it is convenient to use the reduced variate yr. For T = 5 years, Eq. (12.2.7) gives v= -tn{in(= ) 2 -in|in( 5 ) = 1.500 and Eq. (12.2.8) yields Xp=Uu + Ayr =0.569 + 0.138 x 1.500 =0.78 in So the 10-minute, 5 year storm rainfall magnitude at Chicago is 0.78 in. By the same method, the 10- and 50-year values can be shown to be 0.88 in and 1.11 in, Annual maximum 10-minute rainfall in inches at Chicago, Illinois, 1913— 1947 Year 1910 1920 1930 1940 0. 0.53 0.33 0.34 l 0.76 0.96 0.70 Be 0.57 0.94 0.57 3 0.49 0.80 0.80 0.92 4 0.66 - 0.66 0.62 0.66 5 0.36 0.68 0.71 0.65 6 0.58 0.68 Fea) 0.63 7 0.41 0.61 0.64 0.60 8 0.47 0.88 0.52 9 0.74 0.49 0.64 Mean = 0.649 in Standard deviation = 0.177 in FREQUENCY ANALYSIS 389 respectively. It may be noted from the data in Table 12.2.1 that the 50-year return period rainfall was equaled once in the 35 years of data (in 1936), and that the 10- year return period rainfall was equaled or exceeded four times during this period, so the frequency of occurrence of observed extreme rainfalls is approximately as predicted by the model. 12.3. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS USING FREQUENCY FACTORS Calculating the magnitudes of extreme events by the method outlined in Example 12.2.1 requires that the probability distribution function be invertible, that is, given a value for T or [F(x7) = T/(T — 1)], the corresponding value of x7 can be determined. Some probability distribution functions are not readily invertible, including the Normal and Pearson Type III distributions, and an alternative method of calculating the magnitudes of extreme events is required for these distributions. The magnitude x; of a hydrologic event may be represented as the mean yw plus the departure Axz of the variate from the mean (see Fig. 12.3.1): x7 = Mw an Axr (1231) The departure may be taken as equal to the product of the standard deviation o and a frequency factor Kr; that is, Ax7 = Kyo. The departure Ax7 and the frequency factor Ky are functions of the return period and the type of probability distribution to be used in the analysis. Equation (12.3.1) may therefore be expressed as x7 = w+ Kyo (IDES) which may be approximated by | xp =X + Krs (12.3.3) In the event that the variable analyzed is y = logx, then the same method is applied to the statistics for the logarithms of the data, using irra; (12.3.4) and the required value of x7 is found by taking the antilog of yr. The frequency factor equation (12.3.2) was proposed by Chow (1951), and it is applicable to many probability distributions used in hydrologic frequency analysis. For a given distribution, a K—T relationship can be determined between the frequency factor and the corresponding return period. This relationship can be expressed in mathematical terms or by a table. Frequency analysis begins with the calculation of the statistical parameters required for a proposed probability distribution by the method of moments from the given data. For a given return period, the frequency factor can be determined from the K-T relationship for the proposed distribution, and the magnitude x7 computed by Eq. (12.3.3), or (12.3.4). The theoretical K—-T relationships for several probability distributions com- monly used in hydrologic frequency analysis are now described. 390 APPLIED HYDROLOGY f(x) FIGURE 12.3.1 The magnitude of an extreme event x7 expressed as a deviation Kro from the mean pw, where Kr x is the frequency factor. NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. The frequency factor can be expressed from Eq. (12.3.2) as (42.3.5) This is the same as the standard normal variable z defined in Eq. (11.2.9). The value of z corresponding to an exceedence probability of p (p = 1/T) can be calculated by finding the value of an intermediate variable w: 1/2 w= n() (0 <p<0.5) (12.3.6) then calculating z using the approximation a 2.515517 + 0.802853w + 0.010328w? zZ=w (12.3.7) 1 + 1.432788w + 0.189269w? + 0.001308w3 When p > 0.5, 1 — p is substituted for p in (12.3.6) and the value of z computed by (12.3.7) is given a negative sign. The error in this formula is less than 0.00045 in z (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965). The frequency factor K7 for the normal distribution is equal to z, as mentioned above. For the lognormal distribution, the same procedure applies except that it is applied to the logarithms of the variables, and their mean and standard deviation are used in Eq. (12.3.4). event with a return period of 50 years. Solution. For T = 50 years, p = 1/50 = 0.02. From Eq.

For the Extreme Value Type I distribu- tion, Chow (1953) derived the expression Kr = -2losm + In in )h (12.3.8) To express T in terms of K7, the above equation can be written as mofo 1 RS excpae s (12.3.9) where y = 0.5772. When x7 = pm, Eq. (12.3.5) gives Ky = 0 and Eq. (12.3.8) gives T = 2.33 years. This is the return’period of the mean of the Extreme Value Type I distribution. For the Extreme Value Type II distribution, the logarithm of the variate follows the EVI distribution. For this case, (12.3.4) is used to calculate yr, using the value of Kr; from (12.3.8). the frequency factor method and the annual maximum rainfall data given in Table 1222s Solution. The mean and standard deviation of annual maximum rainfalls at Chicago are x = 0.649 in and s = 0.177 in, respectively. For T=5, Eq.

For this disribution, the first step is to take the logarithms of the hydrologic data, y = log x. Usually logarithms to 392 APPLIED HYDROLOGY base 10 are used. The mean y, standard deviation sy, and coefficient of skewness. C, are calculated for the logarithms of the data. The frequency factor depends on the return period T and the coefficient of skewness Cs. When Cs = 0, the frequency factor is equal to the standard normal variable z.

Another feature of the results is that the 50-year return period estimates are about three times as large as the 5- year return period estimates; for this example, the increase in the estimated flood discharges is less than proportional to the increase in return period.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of extreme hydrologic events, what is the purpose of selecting a sequence of the largest or smallest observations from sets of data?", "answer": "The purpose is to study extreme events such as peak flows, which involves using just the largest flow recorded each year at a gaging station out of thousands of values recorded, to understand and analyze these events."}, {"question": "Why are extreme value distributions used in hydrology, and how do they differ from the parent population?", "answer": "Extreme value distributions are used because the observations of extreme hydrologic events are located in the extreme tail of the probability distribution of all observations, making their distribution different from that of the parent population. This difference is crucial for accurately modeling and predicting extreme events like floods and droughts. The use of extreme value distributions allows hydrologists to better understand the probability and magnitude of such events, which is essential for planning, design, and management of water resources and infrastructure."}, {"question": "How does the Extreme Value Type I (EVI) distribution relate to the return period of hydrologic events, and what is the significance of the return period in flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The EVI distribution is directly related to the return period of hydrologic events through the relationship given by Eq. (12.2.7), which allows for the calculation of the return period T based on the reduced variate y. The return period is significant in flood frequency analysis as it provides a measure of the likelihood of a flood event of a certain magnitude occurring within a given year, thereby helping in the design and planning of flood protection measures and water management strategies."}, {"question": "In the context of frequency analysis using frequency factors, how are the magnitudes of extreme events calculated for distributions that are not readily invertible, such as the Normal and Pearson Type III distributions?", "answer": "For distributions that are not readily invertible, the magnitude of an extreme event can be calculated using the frequency factor method. This involves expressing the event magnitude as the mean plus a departure from the mean, where the departure is a product of the standard deviation and a frequency factor. The frequency factor depends on the return period and the type of probability distribution used. This method provides an alternative approach to calculating extreme event magnitudes when direct inversion of the distribution is not feasible."}, {"question": "Why is the log-Pearson Type III distribution often preferred in hydrologic frequency analysis, especially when dealing with skewed data?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution is often preferred because it can accommodate skewness in the data, which is common in hydrologic phenomena. By considering the coefficient of skewness, this distribution provides a more accurate representation of the data, especially for extreme events. This is crucial for reliable flood frequency analysis and for estimating the magnitudes of rare events, as it allows for a better fit to the observed data and reduces the uncertainty associated with predictions of extreme hydrologic events."}, {"question": "How does the inclusion of the coefficient of skewness in the log-Pearson Type III distribution affect the estimated annual maximum discharges compared to using the lognormal distribution?", "answer": "The inclusion of the coefficient of skewness in the log-Pearson Type III distribution can result in slightly different estimates of annual maximum discharges compared to using the lognormal distribution, which assumes no skewness. The effect of skewness is more pronounced for larger return periods. This difference is important because it reflects the distribution's ability to capture the asymmetry in the data, potentially leading to more accurate predictions of extreme flood events. However, the actual impact depends on the magnitude of the skewness and the return period of interest."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic frequency analysis, what is the significance of the return period in determining the design criteria for water management structures?", "answer": "The return period is significant in determining the design criteria for water management structures because it directly influences the magnitude of the design flood. A structure designed for a certain return period (e.g., 50 years) is expected to withstand floods of that magnitude or smaller without failing. The choice of return period reflects a balance between the cost of the structure and the risk of failure, with longer return periods generally requiring more robust and expensive designs. Thus, accurately estimating the return period and the corresponding flood magnitude is critical for ensuring the safety and efficacy of water management infrastructure."}, {"question": "How do extreme value distributions, such as the Extreme Value Type I, II, and III, differ in terms of their application and the type of hydrologic events they model?", "answer": "Extreme value distributions differ in their application and the type of hydrologic events they model based on their mathematical form and the characteristics of the data they are applied to. The Extreme Value Type I distribution is commonly used for modeling maxima and is unbounded, making it suitable for events like storm rainfalls.

{"paragraph": "12.4 PROBABILITY PLOTTING As a check that a probability distribution fits a set of hydrologic data, the data may be plotted on specially designed probability paper, or using a plotting scale FREQUENCY ANALYsIS 395 that linearizes the distribution function. The plotted data are then fitted with a straight line for interpolation and extrapolation purposes. Probability Paper The cumulative probability of a theoretical distribution may be represented graph- ically on probability paper designed for the distribution. On such paper the ordi- nate usually represents the value of x in a certain scale and the abscissa represents the probability P(X = x) or P(X < x), the return period T, or the reduced variate yr. The ordinate and abscissa scales are so designed that the data to be fitted are expected to appear close to a straight line. The purpose of using the probability paper is to linearize the probability relationship so that the plotted data can be easily used for interpolation, extrapolation, or comparison purposes. In the case of extrapolation, however, the effect of various errors is often magnified; there- fore, hydrologists should be warned against such practice if no consideration is given to this effect. Plotting Positions Plotting position refers to the probability value assigned to each piece of data to be plotted. Numerous methods have been proposed for the determination of plotting positions, most of which are empirical. If n is the total number of values to be plotted and m is the rank of a value in a list ordered by descending magnitude, the exceedence probability of the mth largest value, x,,, is, for large n, P(X = Xm) =\" (12.4.1) However, this simple formula (known as California’s formula) produces a prob- ability of 100 percent for m = n, which may not be easily plotted on a probability scale. As an adjustment, the above formula may be modified to aul PX S3,) 2 we (12.4.2) While this formula does not produce a probability of 100 percent, it yields a zero probability (for m = 1), which may not be easily plotted on probability paper either. The above two formulas represent the limits within which suitable plotting positions should lie. One compromise of the two formulas is m—0.5 P(X = Xm) = (12.4.3) n which was first proposed by Hazen (1930). Another compromising formula (known as Chegodayev’s) widely used in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern European countries is m— 0.3 P(X = Xm) = (12.4.4) n+ 0.4 396 APPLIED HYDROLOGY The Weibull formula is a compromise with more statistical justification. If the n values are distributed uniformly between 0 and 100 percent probability, then there must be n + 1| intervals, n — 1 between the data points and 2 at the ends. This simple plotting system is expressed by the Weibull formula: PZ x)= 12 4e5 ie | ( ) indicating a return period one year longer than the period of record for the largest value. In practice, for a complete duration series (employing all the data, not just selected extreme values), Eq. (12.4.1) is used, with n referring to the number of items in the data rather than to the number of years. For annual maximum series, Eq. (12.4.5), which is equivalent to the following formula for return period, was adopted as the standard plotting position method by the U. S. Water Resources Council (1981): Loe (12.4.6) where n referst o the number of years in the record. Most plotting position formulas are represented by the following form: & pg ma— b P= Xm) ee (12.4.7) where b is a parameter. For example, b = 0.5 for Hazen’s formula, b = 0.3 for Chegodayev’s, and b = 0 for Weibull’s. Also, for some other examples b = 3/8 for Blom’s formula, 1/3 for Tukey’s, and 0.44 for Gringorten’s (see Chow, 1964). Cunnane (1978) studied the various available plotting position methods using criteria of unbiasedness and minimum variance. An unbiased plotting method is one that, if used for plotting a large number of equally sized samples, will result in the average of the plotted points for each value of m falling on the theoretical distribution line. A minimum variance plotting method is one that minimizes the variance of the plotted points about the theoretical line. Cunnane concluded that the Weibull plotting formula is biased and plots the largest values of a sample at too small a return period. For normally distributed data, he found that the Blom (1958) plotting position (b = 3/8) is closest to being unbiased, while for data distributed according to the Extreme Value Type I distribution, the Gringorten (1963) formula (b = 0.44) is the best. For the log—Pearson Type II distribution, the optimal value of b depends on the value of the coefficient of skewness, being larger than 3/8 when the data are positively skewed and smaller than 3/8 when the data are negatively skewed. The same plotting positions can be applied to the logarithms of the data, when using the lognormal distribution, for example. Once the data series is identified and ranked, and the plotting positions calculated, a graph of magnitude (x) vs. probability [(P(X > x) p(X = X),Or PF] can be plotted to graphically fit a distribution. Alternatively, an analytical fit can 397 FREQUENCY ANALYSIS be made using the method of moments, and the resulting fitted line compared with the sample data. discharges of the Guadalupe River near Victoria, Texas, given in Table 12.1.1. Compare the plotted data with the lognormal distribution fitted to them in Example WIS Hoy Solution. First the data are ranked from largest (m= 1), to smallest (m=n = 44), as shown in columns | and 2 of Table 12.4.1. Blom’s plotting formula is used, since the logarithms of the data are being fitted to a normal distribution. Blom’s formula uses b = 3/8 in Eq. (12.4.7). For example, for m = 1, the exceedence probability P(Q = 179,000 cfs) = (m — 3/8)/(n + 1 — 6/8) = (1 — 3/8)/(44 + 1/4) = 0.014, as shown in column. 3 of Table 12.4.1. The corresponding value of the standard normal variable z is determined using p= 0.014 in Eqs. (12.3.6) and (12.3.7) in the manner shown in Example 12.3.1; the result, z = 2.194, is listed in column 4 of the table. The event magnitude with the same exceedence probability in the fitted lognormal distribution is found using the frequency factor method with y= 4.2743, s,=0.4027, and Kr = z = 2.194; the result is log Q = 4.2743 + 2.194 x 0.4027 = 5.158 (column 5). This value is compared with log Q from the observed data, that is log (179,000) = 5.253, as shown in column 6. The observed data are plotted against the fitted curve in Fig. 12.4.1, in which the value of the standard normal variable is used as the horizontal axis to linearize the plot; this is equivalent to using normal probability plotting paper. The plot shows that the fitted line is consistent with the observed data, even including the largest value of 179,000 cfs, which looks quite different from the rest of the data in Fig. 12.1.1.

{"paragraph": "12.5 WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL METHOD The U. S. Water Resources Council* recommended that the log—Pearson Type III distribution be used as a base distribution for flood flow frequency studies (U. S. Water Resources Council, 1967, 1976, 1977, and 1981; Benson, 1968). Their decision was an attempt to promote a consistent, uniform approach to flood flow frequency determination for use in all federal planning involving water and related land resources. The choice of the log—Pearson Type III distribution is, however, subjective to some extent, in that there are several criteria that may be employed to select the best distribution, and no single probability distribution is the best under all criteria. Determination of the Coefficient of Skewness The coefficient of skewness used in fitting the log—Pearson Type III distribution is very sensitive to the size of the sample and, in particular, is difficult to estimate *The U.S. Water Resources Council was abolished in 1981.

For example, for T = 100 years, Kr = 1.850 and FREQUENCY ANALYsIS 403 Results of frequency analysis using the Water Resources Council method (Examples 12.5.1 and 12.5.2) Column: 1 2 3 4 5 Return Frequency Flood period factor Estimates T Kr log Qr —Qr Or (years) (cfs) (cfs) 2 0.106 3.686 4,900 5,500 5 0.857 4.019 10,500 10,000 10 1.193 4.169 14,700 13,200 2S 1.512 4.310 20,400 17,600 50 1.697 4.392 24,700 20,900 100 1.850 4.460 28,900 24,200 The values in column 4 are those computed without adjustment for outliers and those in column 5 after outlier adjustment. yr=y +Kys; =3.639 + 1.850 x 0.4439 = 4.460 and Q7 = (10)*4 = 28, 900 cfs, as shown in columns 3 and 4 of the table. Similarly computed flood estimates for the other required return periods are also shown. As was shown in Example (12.3.3), the increase in flood magnitude is less than directly proportional to the increase in return period. For example, increasing the return period from 10 years to 100 years approximately doubles the estimated flood magnitude in the table. As stated previously, flood magnitudes estimated using the log—Pearson Type III distribution are very sensitive to the value of the skew coefficient. The flood magnitudes for the longer return periods (50 and 100 years) are difficult to estimate reliably from only 16 years of data. Testing for Outliers The Water Resources Council method recommends that adjustments be made for outliers. Outliers are data points that depart significantly from the trend of the remaining data. The retention or deletion of these outliers can significantly affect the magnitude of statistical parameters computed from the data, especially for small samples. Procedures for treating outliers require judgment involving both mathematical and hydrologic considerations. According to the Water Resources Council (1981), if the station skew is greater than +0.4, tests for high outliers are considered first; if the station skew is less than —0.4, tests for low outliers are considered first. Where the station skew is between +0.4, tests for both high and low outliers should be applied before eliminating any outliers from the data set. 404 APPLIED HYDROLOGY The following frequency equation can be used to detect high outliers: yH = y + KnSy (12.5.8) where yy is the high outlier threshold in log units and K,, is as given in Table 12.5.3 for sample size n. The K,, values in Table 12.5.3 are used in one-sided tests that detect outliers at the 10-percent level of significance in normally distributed data. If the logarithms of the values in a sample are greater than yy in the above equation, then they are considered high outliers. Flood peaks considered high outliers should be compared with historic flood data and flood information at nearby sites. Historic flood data comprise information on unusually extreme events outside of the systematic record. According to the Water Resources Council (1981), if information is available that inditates a high outlier is the maximum over an extended period of time, the outlier is treated as historic flood data and excluded from analysis. If useful historic information is not available to compare to high outliers, then the outliers should be retained as part of the systematic record. A similar equation can be used to detect low outliers: Vie-= 5G KnSy (12.5.9) where y, is the low outlier threshold in log units. Flood peaks considered low outliers are deleted from the record and a conditional probability adjustment described by the Water Resources Council (1981) can be applied. determine if there are any high or low outliers for the sample. If so, omit them from the data set and recalculate the flood frequency curve.

This table contains one-sided 10-percent significance level K, values for the normal distribution. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS 405 Solution. Step 1. Determine the threshold value for high outliers. From Table 12.5.3, K, = 2.279 for n = 16 data. From Eq. (12.5.8) using y and s, from Example 12.5.1 Yu=y + K,S) = 3.639 + 2.279(0.4439) = 4.651 Then Qn =(10)*%! = 44, 735 cfs The largest recorded value (14,300 cfs in Table 12.5.1) does not exceed the thresh- old value, so there are no high outliers in this sample. Step 2. Determine the threshold value for low outliers. The same K,, value is used: yt = y — KySy = 3.639 — 2.279(0.4439) = 2.627 O; = (10)*?\" = 424 cfs The 1967 peak flow of 303 cfs is less than Q, and so is considered a low outlier. Step 3. The low outlier is deleted from the sample and the frequency analysis is repeated using the same procedure as in Example 12.5.1. The statistics for the logarithms of the new data set, now reduced to 15 values, are y = 3.716, sy = 0.3302, and C, = —0.545. It can be seen that the omission of the 303 cfs value has significantly altered the calculated skewness value (from the —1.24 found in revised weighted skewness is C,, = —0.41. Values of Kare interpolated from Table 12.3.1 at the required return periods, and the corresponding flood flow estimates computed as Q7, listed in column 5 of Table 12.5.2. By comparing these values with those given in column 4 for the full data set, it can be seen that the effect of removing the low outlier in this example is to decrease the flood estimates for the longer return periods.

This recommendation aimed to standardize the methodology across different regions and projects, ensuring that flood risk assessments and management decisions are based on comparable and reliable data. The choice, however, is subjective, as there are several criteria for selecting the best distribution, and no single probability distribution is optimal under all criteria."}, {"question": "How does the coefficient of skewness affect the determination of flood flow frequency, and what challenges are associated with its estimation?", "answer": "The coefficient of skewness plays a crucial role in fitting the log-Pearson Type III distribution for flood flow frequency analysis. It is sensitive to the size of the sample and is particularly challenging to estimate accurately from small samples. The Water Resources Council addressed this challenge by recommending a generalized estimate of the coefficient of skewness, which combines the sample skew with a map skew using a weighting factor. This approach helps minimize the variance of the skew estimate, providing a more reliable basis for flood frequency analysis. However, the accuracy of the skew estimation remains a significant challenge, especially for small datasets, as it can substantially impact the reliability of the flood magnitude estimates for longer return periods."}, {"question": "In the context of the Water Resources Council method, what is the purpose of testing for outliers, and how are high and low outliers treated differently?", "answer": "Testing for outliers is an essential step in the Water Resources Council method for flood flow frequency analysis. The purpose is to identify data points that significantly depart from the trend of the remaining data, which can affect the magnitude of statistical parameters, especially for small samples. High outliers are detected using a specific frequency equation and are compared with historic flood data and information from nearby sites. If a high outlier is confirmed to be the maximum over an extended period, it is treated as historic flood data and excluded from the analysis. In contrast, low outliers are deleted from the record, and a conditional probability adjustment is applied. This differentiation in treatment reflects the distinct implications of high and low outliers on flood frequency analysis and the need for careful consideration of their impact on the reliability of flood estimates."}, {"question": "Why is the log-Pearson Type III distribution considered sensitive to the value of the skew coefficient, and what implications does this have for flood magnitude estimates?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution is sensitive to the value of the skew coefficient because the skew coefficient significantly influences the shape of the distribution, which in turn affects the estimated flood magnitudes, particularly for longer return periods. A small change in the skew coefficient can result in substantial differences in the estimated flood magnitudes. This sensitivity implies that accurate estimation of the skew coefficient is critical for reliable flood frequency analysis. Furthermore, the challenge of accurately estimating the skew from small samples means that flood magnitude estimates for longer return periods (e.g., 50 and 100 years) are subject to considerable uncertainty, highlighting the need for careful interpretation and consideration of the limitations of the data and methodology used."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, how does the weighted skew coefficient (C,) improve the estimation of flood flow frequencies compared to using the sample skew coefficient (C,) alone?", "answer": "The weighted skew coefficient (C,) improves the estimation of flood flow frequencies by combining the sample skew coefficient (C,) with a map skew coefficient (C,) using a weighting factor. This approach helps to minimize the variance of the skew estimate, providing a more stable and reliable basis for flood frequency analysis. By incorporating the map skew, which is derived from a broader geographical context, the weighted skew can reduce the impact of sampling variability and outliers, leading to more accurate and consistent flood frequency estimates. This is particularly important for small samples, where the sample skew can be highly uncertain, and the use of a weighted skew can help to mitigate this uncertainty."}, {"question": "What is the role of the Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data in the context of flood flow frequency studies, and how did it assume the responsibilities of the U.S. Water Resources Council?", "answer": "The Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data assumed the responsibilities of the U.S. Water Resources Council after the latter was abolished in 1981. Specifically, the Committee took over the Council's work on guidelines for determining flood flow frequency, ensuring continuity in the development and application of standardized methodologies for flood risk assessment and management. This transition reflects the ongoing need for coordinated and authoritative guidance on hydrological practices, including flood frequency analysis, to support informed decision-making in water resources management."}]}
{"paragraph": "12.6 RELIABILITY OF ANALYSIS The reliability of the results of frequency analysis depends on how well the assumed probabilistic model applies to a given set of hydrologic data. Confidence Limits Statistical estimates are often presented with a range, or confidence interval, within which the true value can reasonably be expected to lie. The size of the 406 -APpPLIED HYDROLOGY confidence interval depends on the confidence level B. The upper and lower boundary values of the confidence interval are called confidence limits (Fig. 12.6.1). Corresponding to the confidence level B is a significance level a, given by Le a ————5 (a 5 opal) For example, if B = 90 percent, then a = (1 — 0.9)/2 = 0.05, or 5 percent. For estimating the event magnitude for return period T, the upper limit Ur7.q and lower limit Lz. may be specified by adjustment of the frequency factor equation: Ura =Y¥ + 5yKFo (12.6.2) and Le oy Sy (12.6.3) where Ki , and Kf, are the upper and lower confidence limit factors, which can be determined for normally distributed data using the noncentral ¢ distribution (Kendall and Stuart, 1967). The same factors are used to construct approximate confidence limits for the Pearson Type III distribution. Approximate values for these factors are given by the following formulas (Natrella, 1963; U. S. Water Resources Council, 1981): Kr + /K2.— ab Kk, == (12.6.4) Kt, = (12.6.5) 4 Variate x Us Uppppe rT tliimmi t Xr a = L Lower limit ; » Tied\" Sia aae i Probability B = 1-20 Control curves Frequency curve — wee FIGURE 12.6.1 Retum period T Definition of confidence limits.

The log- arithmic mean, standard deviation, and skew coefficient are 3.639, 0.4439, and —0.64, respectively, for 16 years of data. Solution. For B = 0.9, a = 0.05 and the required standard normal variable z, has exceedence probability 0.05, or cumulative probability 0.95. From Table 11.2.1, the required value is z, = 1.645. The frequency factor K;7 for T = 100 years was calculated in Example 12.5.1 as Kjo9 = 1.850. Hence, by Eqs.

The confidence interval is quite wide 408 APPLIED HYDROLOGY in this case because the sample size is small. As the sample size increases, the width of the confidence interval around the estimated flood magnitude will diminish. Standard Error The standard error of estimate s, is a measure of the standard deviation of event magnitudes computed from samples about the true event magnitude. Formulas for the standard error of estimate for the normal and Extreme Value Type I distributions are (Kite, 1977): Normal 4 2 1/2 a [ i ny (12.6.8) n Extreme Value Type I 1 1/2 3 = Au + 1.1396Ky + 1.100083) 5 (12.6.9) n where s is the standard deviation of the original sample of size n. Standard errors may be used to construct confidence limits in a similar manner to that illustrated in Example 12.6.1, except that in this case the confidence limits for significance level a are defined as x7 + SeZq. fidence limits of the 5-year-return-period, 10-minute-duration rainfall at Chicago, Illinois. From Example 12.3.2, the estimated 5-year depth is x7 = 0.78 in; also, s = 0.177 in, Ky = 0.719, and n = 35. Solution. The standard error is computed for the Extreme Value Type I distribution using Eq. (12.6.9) 1 1/2 =| n (1 + 1.1396Ky + 100043) s 1 1/2 =|e l!+ 1.1x3 09.7169 + 1000 (0.119) x 0.177 = 0.046 in The 90 percent confidence limits, with z, = 1.645 for a = 0.05, are xr + 5,24 0.78 + 0.046 x 1.645 = 0.70 and 0.86 in. Thus the 5 year, 10-minute rainfall estimate in Chicago is 0.78 in with 90 percent confidence limits [0.70, 0.86] in. Expected Probability Expected probability is defined as the average of the true exceedence probabilities of all magnitude estimates that might be made from successive samples of a specified size for a specified flood frequency (Beard, 1960; U. S. Water Resources FREQUENCY ANALYsIS 409 Council, 1981). The flood magnitude estimate computed for a given sample is approximately the median of all possible estimates; that is, there is an approxi- mately equal chance that the true magnitude will be either above or below the estimated magnitude. But the probability distribution of the estimate is positively skewed, so the average of the magnitudes computed from many samples is larger than the median. The skewness arises because flood magnitude has a lower bound at zero but no upper bound. The consequence of the discrepancy between the median and the mean flood estimate is that, if a very large number of estimates of flood magnitude are made over a region, on average more 100-year floods will occur than expected (Beard, 1978). The expected probability of occurence of flood events in any year can be estimated for events of nominal return period T by the following formulas, which are derived for the normal distribution, and apply approximately to the Pearson Type III distribution (Beard, 1960; Hardison and Jennings, 1972). The expected probability for the normal distribution is expressed for a sample size of n as n \\il2 E(Pn) = Pltp-1 > | (12.6.10) alot where z is the standard normal variable for the desired probability of exceedence and t,—, is the student’s t-statistic with n — 1 degrees of freedom. Calculation can be performed using the appropriate tables for t,—, and z. These computations can also be carried out using the following equations (U. S. Water Resources Council, 1981; U. S.

This skewness means that the average of the magnitudes computed from many samples is larger than the median, leading to more frequent occurrences of large floods than expected. Understanding expected probability helps in accurately assessing flood risks and planning mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, how do standard errors of estimate contribute to the understanding of flood magnitudes?", "answer": "Standard errors of estimate, such as those given by formulas for the normal and Extreme Value Type I distributions, provide a measure of the standard deviation of event magnitudes computed from samples about the true event magnitude. These errors can be used to construct confidence limits, offering insights into the variability and reliability of flood magnitude estimates. For instance, a smaller standard error indicates more precise estimates, while a larger error suggests greater uncertainty, influencing the confidence in flood risk assessments and management decisions."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the sample size on the width of the confidence interval in flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The width of the confidence interval around the estimated flood magnitude diminishes as the sample size increases. This means that larger sample sizes lead to more precise estimates of flood magnitudes, reducing the uncertainty associated with flood frequency analysis. Consequently, hydrologists prefer larger datasets to enhance the reliability of their predictions and to better inform flood protection and water resource management decisions."}, {"question": "How do confidence limits for significance level a relate to the standard normal variable z, in the context of flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "Confidence limits for a given significance level a are defined by the standard normal variable z, which corresponds to the cumulative probability 1 - a/2. For example, for a = 0.05, z, = 1.645, indicating that the confidence limits are determined by how far the estimated flood magnitude is from the mean, measured in terms of standard deviations, thus providing a statistical basis for assessing the reliability of flood predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of flood risk assessment, why is it essential to consider the expected probability of flood events rather than just the return period?", "answer": "Considering the expected probability of flood events is essential because it provides a more accurate assessment of flood risk by accounting for the skewness in flood magnitude distributions. The return period, while useful, does not capture the full complexity of flood risk, as it does not account for the possibility of more frequent occurrences of large floods due to the skewness of the distribution. Thus, expected probability offers a more nuanced understanding of flood risks, enabling better planning and decision-making."}, {"question": "How does the standard error of estimate for the Extreme Value Type I distribution differ from that of the normal distribution?", "answer": "The standard error of estimate for the Extreme Value Type I distribution, given by specific formulas, differs from that of the normal distribution due to the inherent characteristics of each distribution. The Extreme Value Type I distribution is particularly suited for modeling extreme events like floods, and its standard error reflects the unique statistical properties of such events, including skewness and the potential for very large magnitudes. This distinction is crucial for accurately assessing the uncertainty associated with flood magnitude estimates derived from these distributions."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic frequency analysis, what role do plotting positions play in determining the return period of flood events?", "answer": "Plotting positions are crucial in hydrologic frequency analysis as they help in determining the return period of flood events by providing a graphical representation of the data. The choice of plotting position formula can affect the estimated return periods, with different formulas (like Gringorten's or Cunnane's) offering slightly different perspectives on the data. This graphical approach complements statistical methods, allowing hydrologists to visually assess the relationship between flood magnitudes and their return periods, thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of flood frequency."}, {"question": "Why is the log-Pearson Type III distribution often preferred for flood frequency analysis in hydrology?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution is often preferred for flood frequency"}]}

Different formulas can lead to varying interpretations of the data, affecting the estimation of flood frequencies and the design of flood protection measures. For instance, if the Weibull formula suggests a higher frequency of extreme floods than the Gringorten formula, this could lead to more conservative design standards for flood control structures. Therefore, understanding the differences between these formulas and their applications is crucial for making informed decisions in hydrological engineering and water resource management."}, {"question": "How do plotting formulas like Blom’s and Weibull facilitate the analysis of annual maximum discharge data?", "answer": "Plotting formulas like Blom’s and Weibull facilitate the analysis of annual maximum discharge data by transforming the data into a form that is more amenable to analysis on a probability scale.

The use of y allows for the standardization of the data, enabling the comparison of different datasets and the identification of extreme events in a consistent manner. This standardization is essential for the accurate prediction and analysis of rare hydrological events."}, {"question": "How does the choice of plotting formula affect the design of flood protection measures?", "answer": "The choice of plotting formula can significantly affect the design of flood protection measures. Different formulas may predict different frequencies or magnitudes of extreme floods, leading to variations in the design standards for structures like dams, levees, and floodwalls. For example, if a formula predicts more frequent or severe floods, the design might require higher walls or more robust construction to ensure safety. Therefore, selecting the appropriate plotting formula is critical to ensure that flood protection measures are adequately designed to protect against potential flood risks."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, why is it necessary to analyze annual maximum discharge data?", "answer": "Analyzing annual maximum discharge data is necessary in flood frequency analysis because it provides insights into the probability and magnitude"}]}

Hydrologic design may be used to develop plans for a new structure, such as a flood control levee, or to develop management programs for better control of an existing system, for example, by producing a flood plain map for limiting construction near a river. There are many factors besides hydrology that bear on the design of water resource systems; these include public welfare and safety, economics, aesthetics, legal issues, and engineering factors such as geotechnical and structural design. While the central concern of the hydrologist is on the flow of water through a system, he or she must also be aware of these other factors and of how the hydrologic operation of the system might affect them. In this sense hydrologic design is a much broader subject than hydrologic analysis as covered in previous chapters.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flood flow frequency analysis, what is the purpose of using the log-Pearson Type III distribution?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution is used to determine the flood discharge for specific return periods, such as 2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year events, by analyzing the annual maximum discharges of a river. This distribution is particularly useful for hydrologists as it allows them to estimate the probability of extreme flood events, which is crucial for designing flood control structures and managing flood risk. The use of this distribution also enables the consideration of skewness and outliers in the data, providing a more accurate representation of flood frequency."}, {"question": "How does the U.S. Water Resources Council method account for skewness in flood flow frequency analysis?", "answer": "The U.S. Water Resources Council method accounts for skewness by using a map skew coefficient, which is a regional skewness coefficient that is used in conjunction with the sample skew coefficient to adjust the flood frequency curve. This adjustment is necessary because skewness can significantly impact the accuracy of flood frequency estimates, particularly for extreme events. By incorporating both the sample and map skew coefficients, the U.S. Water Resources Council method provides a more robust and reliable approach to flood flow frequency analysis."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the 90-percent confidence limits of the flood flow frequency curve in hydrologic design?", "answer": "Considering the 90-percent confidence limits of the flood flow frequency curve is important because it provides a range of possible flood discharges for a given return period, rather than a single estimate. This range reflects the uncertainty associated with the flood frequency analysis and allows hydrologists to design flood control structures and manage flood risk with a greater degree of confidence. By accounting for this uncertainty, hydrologists can ensure that their designs are more resilient and better equipped to handle extreme flood events."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, how do factors such as public welfare and safety, economics, aesthetics, and legal issues influence the design of water resource systems?", "answer": "Factors such as public welfare and safety, economics, aesthetics, and legal issues play a crucial role in hydrologic design as they can impact the selection of design parameters, the choice of flood control measures, and the overall management of flood risk. For example, economic considerations may influence the choice of flood control structures, while aesthetic concerns may impact the design of flood protection measures. Similarly, legal issues, such as regulatory requirements and environmental permits, can also influence the design of water resource systems. By considering these factors, hydrologists can ensure that their designs are not only technically sound but also socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable."}, {"question": "What is the difference between hydrologic analysis and hydrologic design, and why is hydrologic design a broader subject?", "answer": "Hydrologic analysis refers to the process of studying the flow of water through a system, while hydrologic design involves assessing the impact of hydrologic events on a water resource system and choosing values for key variables to ensure adequate performance. Hydrologic design is a broader subject because it considers not only the technical aspects of hydrology but also other factors such as public welfare and safety, economics, aesthetics, and legal issues.

The lognormal distribution assumes that the logarithms of the flood discharges are normally distributed, while the log-Pearson Type III distribution can account for skewness and outliers, providing a more accurate representation of flood frequency. The choice of distribution depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to plot the 90-percent confidence limits of the flood flow frequency curve for different return periods?", "answer": "Plotting the 90-percent confidence limits of the flood flow frequency curve for different return periods is necessary because it provides a visual representation of the uncertainty associated with the flood frequency analysis.

{"paragraph": "13.1 HYDROLOGIC DESIGN SCALE The purposes of water resources planning and management may be grouped roughly into two categories. One is water control, such as drainage, flood con- trol, pollution abatement, insect control, sediment control, and salinity control. The other is water use and management, such as domestic and industrial water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, recreation, fish and wildlife improve- ment, low-flow augmentation for water quality management, and watershed management. In either case, the task of the hydrologist is the same, namely, to determine a design inflow, to route the flow through the system, and to check 416 HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 417 whether the output values are satisfactory. The difference between the two cases is that design for water control is usually concerned with extreme events of short duration, such as the instantaneous peak discharge during a flood, or the minimum flow over a period of a few days during a dry period, while design for water use is concerned with the complete flow hydrograph over a period of years. The hydrologic design scale is the range in magnitude of the design variable (such as the design discharge) within which a value must be selected to determine the inflow to the system (see Fig. 13.1.1). The most important factors in selecting the design value are cost and safety. It is too costly to design small structures such as culverts for very large peak discharges; however, if a major hydraulic structure, such as the spillway on a large dam, is designed for too small a flood, the result might be a catastrophe, such as a dam’s failure. The optimal magnitude for design is one that balances the conflicting considerations of cost and safety. Estimated Limiting Value The practical upper limit of the hydrologic design scale is not infinite, since the global hydrologic cycle is a closed system; that is, the total quantity of water on earth is essentially constant. Some hydrologists recognize no upper limit, but such a view is physically unrealistic. The lower limit of the design scale is zero in most cases, since the value of the design variable cannot be negative. Although the true upper limit is usually unknown, for practical purposes an estimated upper limit may be determined. This estimated limiting value (ELV) is defined as the largest magnitude possible for a hydrologic event at a given location, based on the best available hydrologic information. The range of uncertainty for the ELV 100 Estimated limiting value (ELV) 75 90 5 1=2) 80 5 3 1000 =os m 70 2, 6 SOO eae ate + s a os 2=| 60 200 §=| § g3) a 100-8 2 i ar] aha akin ye oe tEBnateees FIGURE 13.1.1 ‘ard 10 cine Hydrologic design scale. Approximate 2 S ranges of the design level for different types 5 a of structures are shown. Design may be 2 based on a percentage of the ELV or on ] a design return period. The values for the two scales shown in the diagram are illus- trative only and do not correspond directly 0 with one another. 418 appLiED HYDROLOGY depends on the reliability of information, technical knowledge, and accuracy of analysis. As information, knowledge, and analysis improve, the estimate better approximates the true upper limit, and its range of uncertainty decreases. There have been cases in which observed hydrologic events exceeded their previously estimated limiting values. The concept of an estimated limiting value is implicit in the commonly used probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and the corresponding probable maximum flood (PMF). The probable maximum precipitation is defined by the World Meteorological Organization (1983) as a “quantity of precipitation that is close to the physical upper limit for a given duration over a particular basin.” Based on worldwide records, the PMP can have a return period of as long as 500,000,000 years, corresponding approximately to a frequency factor of 15. However, the return period varies geographically. Some would arbitrarily assign a return period, say 10,000 years, to the PMP or PMF, but this suggestion has no physical basis. Probability-Based Limits Because of its unknown probability, the estimated limiting value is used deterministically. Lower down on the design scale, a probability- or frequency- based approach is commonly adopted. The magnitudes of hydrologic events at this level are smaller, usually within or near the range of frequent observations. As a result, their probabilities of occurrence can be estimated adequately when hydrologic records of sufficient length are available for frequency analysis. The probabilistic approach is less subjective and more theoretically manageable than the deterministic approach. Probabilistic methods also lead to logical ways of determining optimum design levels, such as by hydroeconomic and risk analyses, which will be discussed in Sec. 13.2. For a densely populated area, where the failure of water-control works would result in loss of life and extensive property damage, a design using the ELV might be justified. In a less populous area where failure would result only in minor damage, a design for a much smaller degree of protection is reasonable. Between these extremes on the hydrologic design scale, varying conditions exist and varying design values are required. When the probabilistic behavior of a hydrologic event can be determined, it is usually best to use the event magnitude for a specified return period as a design value. Based on past experience and judgment, some generalized design criteria for water-control structures have been developed, as summarized in Table 13.1.1. According to the potential consequence of failure, structures are classified as major, intermediate and minor, the corresponding approximate ranges on the design scale are shown in Fig. 13.1.1. The criteria for dams in Table 13.1.1 pertain to the design of spillway capacities, and are taken from the National Academy of Sciences (1983). The Academy defines a small dam as having 50- 1000 acre-ft of storage or being 25-40 ft high, an intermediate dam as having 1000-50 ,000 acre:f to f storage or being 40-100 ft high, and a large dam as having more than 50,000 acre-ft of storage or being more than 100 ft high.

In the case of an intermediate structure, a small loss of life would be possible and the damage would be within the financial capability of the owner. For minor structures, there generally would be no loss of life, and the damage would be of the same magnitude as the cost of replacing or repairing the structure. Design for Water Use The above discussion applies to the hydrologic design for the control of excessive waters, such as floods. Design for water use is handled similarly, except that insufficient rather than excessive water is the concern. Because of the long time 420 APPLIED HYDROLOGY span of droughts, there are fewer of them in historical hydrologic records than there are extreme floods. It is therefore more difficult to determine drought design levels through frequency analysis, especially if the design event lasts several years, as is sometimes the case in water supply design. A common basis for the design of municipal water supply systems is the critical drought of record, that is, the worst recorded drought. The design is considered satisfactory if it will supply water at the required rate throughout an equivalent critical period. The limitation of the critical-period approach is that the risk level associated with basing the design on this single historical event is unknown. To overcome this limitation, methods of synthetic streamflow generation have been developed using computers and random number generation to prepare synthetic streamflow records that are statistically equivalent to the historical record. Together with the historical record, the synthetic records provide a probabilistic basis for design against drought events (Hirsch, 1979; Salas, et al., 1980). Hydrologic design for water use is closely regulated by the legal framework of water rights, especially in arid regions. The law specifies which users will have their allocations reduced in the event of a shortage. In an effort to protect the fish and wildlife of a stream, methods have been developed in recent years to quantify their need for instream flow (Milhous and Grenney, 1980). Unlike flood control and water supply, for which sufficient hydrologic information is provided by flow rate and water level, instream flow needs are influenced also by turbidity, temperature, and other water quality variables in a complex manner varying from one species to another. Water resources systems are subject to the demands of competing users, the need to maintain instream flow, and competing demands related to flood control. Hydrologic design must specify the appropriate design level for each of these factors.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design for water control, what are the primary considerations for selecting a design value?", "answer": "The primary considerations for selecting a design value in hydrologic design for water control are cost and safety. It is crucial to balance these conflicting factors, as designing for very large peak discharges can be too costly, while designing for too small a flood can lead to catastrophic failures, such as a dam's failure. The optimal magnitude for design is one that balances these considerations, ensuring that the structure can withstand extreme events without being overly expensive."}, {"question": "How does the concept of an estimated limiting value (ELV) influence hydrologic design, and what factors affect its range of uncertainty?", "answer": "The estimated limiting value (ELV) is the largest magnitude possible for a hydrologic event at a given location, based on the best available hydrologic information. It influences hydrologic design by providing a practical upper limit for design variables, such as design discharge. The range of uncertainty for the ELV depends on the reliability of information, technical knowledge, and accuracy of analysis. As information, knowledge, and analysis improve, the estimate better approximates the true upper limit, and its range of uncertainty decreases. This concept is crucial in determining the design scale for water-control structures, as it helps hydrologists to select a design value that balances cost and safety."}, {"question": "In the context of water use and management, why is it more challenging to determine drought design levels through frequency analysis compared to flood design levels?", "answer": "Determining drought design levels through frequency analysis is more challenging because droughts have a longer time span and are less frequent in historical hydrologic records compared to extreme floods. This scarcity of data makes it difficult to estimate the probabilities of occurrence for drought events, especially when the design event lasts several years, as is sometimes the case in water supply design. As a result, alternative methods, such as synthetic streamflow generation, have been developed to provide a probabilistic basis for design against drought events."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the probabilistic approach in hydrologic design, and how does it differ from the deterministic approach?", "answer": "The probabilistic approach in hydrologic design is significant because it allows for the estimation of probabilities of occurrence for hydrologic events, enabling the determination of optimum design levels through hydroeconomic and risk analyses. This approach differs from the deterministic approach, which relies on the estimated limiting value (ELV) and does not account for the probability of occurrence. The probabilistic approach is less subjective and more theoretically manageable, providing a logical way to determine design levels based on the probability of occurrence of hydrologic events."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design for water use, how do legal frameworks and water rights influence the design process?", "answer": "Legal frameworks and water rights play a crucial role in hydrologic design for water use, especially in arid regions. The law specifies which users will have their allocations reduced in the event of a shortage, and hydrologic design must consider these allocations to ensure that the design meets the required water supply demands. Additionally, methods have been developed to quantify the instream flow needs of fish and wildlife, which must be balanced with the demands of competing users and flood control requirements. This complex interplay of factors highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to hydrologic design that considers both technical and legal aspects."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider instream flow needs in hydrologic design for water use, and what factors influence these needs?", "answer": "Considering instream flow needs is essential in hydrologic design for water use because it directly affects the health and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. Instream flow needs are influenced by factors such as turbidity, temperature, and other water quality variables, which vary from one species to another. Unlike flood control and water supply, which can be addressed through flow rate and water level alone, instream flow needs require a more comprehensive approach that accounts for these complex relationships. This highlights the importance of integrating ecological and hydrological considerations in hydrologic design to ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources systems."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what are the implications of using the critical drought of record as a basis for design, and what are the limitations of this approach?", "answer": "Using the critical drought of record as a basis for design implies that the design will be satisfactory if it can supply water at the required rate throughout an equivalent critical period. However, the limitation of this approach is that the risk level associated with basing the design on this single historical event is unknown. This uncertainty can be addressed through the use of synthetic streamflow generation methods, which provide a probabilistic basis for design against drought events. By acknowledging these limitations, hydrologists can develop more robust designs that account for the variability and uncertainty of hydrologic events."}]}
{"paragraph": "13.2 SELECTION OF THE DESIGN LEVEL A hydrologic design level on the design scale is the magnitude of the hydrologic event to be considered for the design of a structure or project. As it is not always economical to design structures and projects for the estimated limiting value, the ELV is often modified for specific design purposes. The final design value may be further modified according to engineering judgment and the experience of the designer or planner. Three approaches are commonly used to determine a hydrologic design value: an empirical approach, risk analysis, and hydroeconomic analysis. Empirical Approach During the early years of hydraulic engineering practice, around the early 1900s, a spillway designed to pass a flood 50 to 100 percent larger than the largest recorded in a period of perhaps 25 years was considered adequate. This design criterion is no more than a rule of thumb involving an arbitrary factor of safety. As an example of the inadequacies of this criterion, the Republican River in Nebraska in 1935 experienced a flood over 10 times as large as any that had occurred on HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 421 that river during 40 prior years of record. This design practice was found to be entirely inadequate, and hydrologists and hydraulic engineers searched for better methods. As an empirical approach the most extreme event among past observations is often selected as the design value. The probability that the most extreme event of the past N years will be equaled or exceeded once during the next n years can be estimated as P(N,n)= wos, (1322.1) Thus, for example, the probability that the largest flood observed in N years will be equaled or exceeded in N future years is 0.50. If a drought lasting m years is the critical event of record over an N-year period, what is the probability P(N, m,n) that a worse drought will occur within the next n years? The number of sequences of length m in N years of record is N-—~m + 1, and inn years of record n — m + 1. Thus the chance that the worst event over the past and future spans combined will be contained in the n future years is given approximately by (=S E I) er ae Geeeh naue ee) (3272) n—m +1 = = Wego. = which reduces to (13.2.1) when m = 1. hydrologic data, lasted 5 years, what is the chance that a more severe drought will occur during the next 20 years?

A water-control structure might fail if the magnitude for the design return period T is exceeded within the expected life of the structure. This natural, or inherent, hydrologic risk of failure can be calculated using Eq. (12.1.4): Ret [1 PS xl” (13°2:9) where P(X = x7) = 1/T, and n is the expected life of the structure; R represents the probability that an event x = x7 will occur at least once in n years.

If, for example, a hydrologist wants to be approximately 90 percent certain that the design capacity of a culvert will not be exceeded during the structure’s expected life of 10 years, he or she designs for the 100-year peak discharge of runoff. If a 40-percent risk of failure is acceptable, the design return period can be reduced to 20 years or the expected life extended to 50 years. risk of at least one event exceeding the culvert capacity during the design life is 10 percent, what design return period should be used? What is the chance that a culvert designed for an event of this return period will not have its capacity exceeded for 50 years? Solution. By Eq. (13.2.3) =R =1-(1- 21\\]2 T or 1\\'0 0.10=1 -( - =| T and solving yields T = 95 years. HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 423 If T = 95 years, the risk of failure over n = SO years is / \\ i 95 So the probability that the capacity will not be exceeded during this 50-year period is 1 — 0.41 = 0.59, or 59 percent. It can be seen in Fig. 13.2.1 that, for a given risk of failure, the required design return period T increases linearly with the design life n, as T and n become large. Under these conditions, what is the risk of failure if the design return period is equal to the design life, that is, T = n? By expanding Eq. (13.2.3) as a power series, it can be shown that for large values of n, 1 — (1 — 1/T)\" = 1 — e 77, so, for T = n, the risk is 1 — e ~' = 0.632. For example, there is approximately a 63-percent chance that a 100-year event will be exceeded at least once during the next 100 years. Although natural hydrologic uncertainty can be accounted for as above, other kinds of uncertainty are difficult to calculate. These are often treated using a safety factor, SF, or a safety margin, SM. Letting the hydrologic design value be L and the actual capacity adopted for the project be C, the factor of safety is SF = — (13.2.4) and the safety margin is SM=C-L (13-275) The actual capacity is larger than the hydrologic design value because it has to allow for other kinds of uncertainty: technological (hydraulic, structural, construction, operation, etc.), socioeconomic, political, and environmental. For a specified hydrologic risk R and design life n of a structure, Eq. (13.2.3) can be used to compute the relevant return period T. The hydro- logic event magnitude L corresponding to this exceedence probability is found by a frequency analysis of hydrologic data. The design value C is then given by L multiplied by an assigned factor of safety, or by L plus an added margin of safety. For example, it is customary to design levees with a safety margin of one to three feet, that is, one to three feet of freeboard above the calculated maximum water surface elevation. Hydroeconomic Analysis The optimum design return period can be determined by hydroeconomic analysis if the probabilistic nature of a hydrologic event and the damage that will result if it occurs are both known over the feasible range of hydrologic events. As the design return period increases, the capital cost of a structure increases, but the expected damages decrease because of the better protection afforded. By summing 424 appLIED HYDROLOGY the capital cost and the expected damage cost on an annual basis, a design return period having minimum total cost can be found. Figure 13.2.2(a) shows the damage that would result if an event, such as a flood, having the specified return period were to occur. If the design event magnitude is x7, the structure will prevent all damages for events with x = x7 but none for x > x7, so the expected annual damage cost is found by taking the product of the probability f(x)d x that an event of magnitude x will occur in any given year, and the damage D(x) that would result from that event, and Return period (years) l 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 500 400 S 300 Se 80 = 200 fSas) 100 0 0.5 0.2 0.1 0.04 0.02 9.01 0.005 Annual exceedence probability (a) Damages for events of various retum periods. 80 Optimum design return re period (25 years) Minimum total cost p ry (C$os1t0 00) Damage risk cost \\ iin= shaded area’ in (a) 1 = | 1 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 Design return period (years) © Risk cost 9 Capital cost A Total cost (b) Hydroeconomic analysis.

Summing these incremental costs yields an annual expected damage cost of $49,098/year if no structure is built. This represents the average annual cost of flood damage over many years, assuming constant economic conditions. This amount is the damage risk cost corresponding to no structure, and is shown in the first line of column 6 of the table. The damage risk costs diminish as the design return period of the control structure increases. For example, if T = 2 years were selected, the damage risk cost would be 49,098 —AD, = 49,098 — 5,000 = $44,098/year. The values of damage risk cost and capital cost (column 7) are added to form the total cost (column 8); the three costs are plotted in Fig. 13.2.2(b). It can be seen from the table and the figure that the optimum design return period, the one having minimal total cost, is 25 years, for which the total cost is $40,250/year. Of this amount, $29,000/year (72 percent) is capital cost and $11,250/year (28 percent) is damage risk cost. Hydroeconomic analysis has been applied to the design of flood control reservoirs, levees, channels, and highway stream crossings (Corry, Jones, and Thompson, 1980). For a flood damage study, the duration and extent of flooding must be determined for events of various return periods and economic surveys must be taken to quantify damages for each level of flooding. The social costs of flooding are difficult to quantify. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center in Davis, California, has available the following computer programs for hydroeconomic analysis (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1986): HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 427 DAMCAL (Damage Reach Stage-Damage Calculation), EAD (Expected Annual Flood Damage Computation), SID (Structure Inventory for Damage Analysis), AGDAM (Agricultural Flood Damage Analysis), and SIPP (Interactive Nonstruc- tural Analysis Package). 13.3. FIRST ORDER ANALYSIS OF UNCERTAINTY Many of the uncertainties associated with hydrologic systems are not quantifiable. For example, the conveyance capacity of a culvert with an unobstructed entrance can be calculated within a small margin of error, but during a flood, debris may become lodged around the entrance to the culvert, reducing its conveyance capacity by an amount that cannot be predetermined. Hydrologic uncertainty may be broken down into three categories: natural, or inherent, uncertainty, which arises from the random variability of hydrologic phenomena; model uncertainty, which results from the approximations made when representing phenomena by equations; and parameter uncertainty, which stems from the unknown nature of the coefficients in the equations, such as the bed roughness in Manning’s equation. Inherent uncertainty in the magnitude of the design event is described by Eq. (13.2.3); in this section, model and parameter uncertainty will be considered. The first order analysis of uncertainty is a procedure for quantifying the expected variability of a dependent variable calculated as a function of one or more independent variables (Ang and Tang, 1975; Kapur and Lamberson, 1977; Ang and Tang, 1984; Yen, 1986). Suppose w is expressed as a function of x: w = f(x) (13.3.1) There are two sources of error in w: first, the function f, or model, may be incorrect; second, the measurement of x may be inaccurate. In the following analysis it is assumed that there is no model error, or bias. Kapur and Lamberson (1977) show how to extend the analysis when there is model error. Assuming, then, that f(-) is a correct model, a nominal value of x, denoted x, is selected as a design input and the corresponding value of w calculated: w = f(%) (13.3.2) If the true value of x differs from x, the effect of this discrepancy on w can be estimated by expanding f(x) as a Taylor series around x = x: tu df # Aap ay] w = f(x) + rm ae naa” is) tiie 33373) where the derivatives df/dx, d*f/dx*, ... , are evaluated at x = ¥. If second and higher order terms are neglected, the resulting first order expression for the error in w 1S w- w= Dh ee ® (13.3.4) dx The variance of this error is s2, = E[(w — #)?] where E is the expectation operator [see Eq. (11.3.3)]; that is, 428 APPLIED HYDROLOGY or df 2-(¢) s (13.3.5) where s? is the variance of x. Equation (13.3.5) gives the variance of a dependent variable w as a function of the variance of an independent variable x, assuming that the functional rela- tionship w = f(x) is correct. The value s,, is the standard error of estimate of w. If w is dependent on several mutually independent variables x), X2,-..., Xn, it can be shown by a procedure similar to the above that 2 2 2 2 of \\ 4 of \\ 2 of \\ 2 Sto aati ream iw | son 13.3.6 *w ea Sx (2) x fe *n ( ) Kapur and Lamberson (1977) show how to extend (13.3.6) to account for the effect on 6% of correlation between x}, x2, ..., Xn, if any exists. First-Order Analysis of Manning’s Equation: Depth as the Dependent Variable Manning’s equation is widely applied in hydrology to determine depths of flow for specified flow rates, or to determine discharges for specified depths of flow, taking into account the resistance to flow in channels arising from bed roughness. A common application, such as in channel design or flood plain delineation, is to calculate the depth of flow y in the channel, given the flow rate Q, roughness coefficient n, and the shape and slope of the channel as determined by design or by surveys. Once the depth of flow (or elevation of the water surface) is known, the values of the design variables are determined, such as the channel wall elevation or the flood plain extent. The hydrologist faced with this task is conscious of the uncertainties involved, especially in the selection of the design flow and Manning roughness. Although it is not so obvious, there is also uncertainty in the value of the friction slope Sy, depending on how it is calculated, ranging from the simplest case of uniform flow (S, = S,) to more complex cases of steady nonuniform flow or unsteady nonuniform flow [see Eq. (9.2.1)]. The first-order analysis of uncertainty can be used to estimate the effect on y of uncertainty in Q, n, and S,. Consider, first, the effect on flow depth of variation in the flow rate Q. Manning’s equation is written in English units as 1.49 aie Hake ea (13.3.7) where A is the cross-sectional area and R the hydraulic radius, both dependent on the flow depth y. If variations in y are dependent only on variations in Q, then, HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 429 by (13.3.5), dy i 5 = (3) A (13.3.8) where dy/dQ is the rate at which the depth changes with changes in Q. Now, in Chap. 5, it was shown [Eq. (5.6.15)] that the inverse of this derivative, namely dQ/dy, is given for Manning’s equation by AO aoe a at (13.3.9) dy 3Rdy A dy (1/A)(dA/dy) for common channel cross sections. Substituting into (13.3.8), ‘ap S ss = ——___2 ___ 137310 é nize dRex <1dA 2 Q 3Rd y A dy But sg/Q = CVo, the coefficient of variation of the flow rate (see Table 11.3.1), so (13.3.10) can be rewritten , CVG Ss, = A (1353.11) 2 dR ” 1 dA 3Rdy A dy which specifies the variance of the flow depth as a function of the coefficient of variation of the flow rate and the value of the channel shape function.

A hydrologist estimates that the design flow rate is 5000 cfs and that the roughness is n = 0.035. If the coefficients of variation of the flow estimate and the roughness estimate are 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively, what is the standard error of estimate of the flow depth y? If houses are built next to this channel with floor elevation one foot above the water surface elevation calculated for the design event, estimate the chance that these houses will be flooded during the design event due to uncertainties involved in calculating the water level. Assume uniform flow. Solution. For a width of 50 feet, A = 50y and R = SOy/(SO + 2y); the flow depth for the base case is calculated from Manning’s equation: 430 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Q= 11.

If the water surface elevation y is normally distributed, then the probability that they will be flooded is evaluated by converting y to the standard normal variable z by subtracting the mean value of y (7.37 ft) from both sides of the inequality and dividing by the standard error (1.63 ft): Py> 8.37) = Pp ~ 883.37¢ —T—. 1.63 1.63 Vie 3 as = > i 1.63 G-6le = P(z > 0.613) = 1— F,(0.613) where F, is the standard normal distribution function. Using Table 11.2.1 or the method employed in Example 11.2.1, the result is F (0.613) = 0.73, so P(y > 8.37) = 1 — 0.73 = 0.27. There is approximately a 27 percent chance that the houses will be flooded during the design event due to uncertainties in calculating the water level for that event. This example has treated only parameter uncertainty in the calculations. The true probability that the houses will be flooded is greater than that calculated here, because the critical flood may exceed the design magnitude (due to natural uncertainty). HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 431 It is clear from Example 13.3.1 that reasonable amounts of uncertainty in the estimation of Q and n can produce significant uncertainty in flow depth. A 15-percent error in estimating n = 0.035 is an error of 0.035 x 0.15 = 0.005. This would be indicated from a measurement of 0.035 + 0.005, which is about as accurate as an experienced hydrologist can get from observation of an existing channel. A 30-percent error in estimating Q is 5000 x 0.30 = 1500 cfs. An estimate of Q = 5000 + 1500 cfs may also reflect the correct order of uncertainty, especially if the design return period is large (e.g., T = 100 years). The use of the channel shape function (2/3R)(dR/dy) + (1/A)(dA/dy) in (13.3.12) depends on knowledge of dR/dy and dA/dy, which may be difficult to obtain for irregularly shaped channels. Also, the assumption that y depends on Q alone may not be valid. In such cases, Eq. (13.3.6) can be used to obtain s,, treating y as a function of Q and n, and a computer program simulating flow in the channel can be used to estimate the required partial derivatives dy/0Q and oy/ on by rerunning the program for various values of Q and n and reading off the computed values of flow depth or water surface elevation. Figure 13.3.1 shows the results of such a procedure for the channel and conditions given in Example 13.3.1. The gradients dy/dQ aud dy/dn are approximately linear for this example; this validates the use of only first-order terms in the analysis of uncertainty (if the lines were significantly curved, analysis would require keeping the second- order terms in the Taylor-series expansion). 5000 cfs, S, = 0.01, n = 0.035), the variation of flow rate with flow depth at the base case level has been found from Fig. (13.3.1) to be 0Q/dy = 1028 cfs/ft, and the variation of n with flow depth, dn/dy = 0.0072 fim elt CV 9 = 0.30 and CV,, = 0.15, calculate the standard error of y.

Equation (13.3.15) assumes that the cross-sectional shape of the channel and the flood plain are both symmetrical about the channel center line. This equation can be used to evaluate levee capacity (the flow rate the levee can carry without overtopping). The levee capacity can be considered a random variable related to the independent random variables n,, np, and Sr. Applying first-order analysis, the coefficient of variation of the capacity is (Lee and Mays, 1986) 1 CVo = CYS, + gen + ate CV (13.3.16) HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 433 where CV4., CVp., CVa4,, and CVp, have been assumed negligible, and A 5/3 2/3 Ne \\(An\\ (Pe (13.3.17) vY=1+2 np ]\\Ac Ep In studies of flood data on the Ohio River, Lee and Mays (1986) concluded that uncertainties in the roughness coefficients and the friction slope account for 95 percent of the uncertainties in computing the capacity.

The final design value can be determined using three approaches: empirical, risk analysis, or hydroeconomic analysis."}, {"question": "Why is the empirical approach to hydrologic design considered inadequate, and what are its limitations?", "answer": "The empirical approach is considered inadequate because it relies on arbitrary factors of safety and does not account for the probabilistic nature of hydrologic events.

This approach can lead to underdesign or overdesign, resulting in increased costs or reduced safety."}, {"question": "How does the risk analysis approach to hydrologic design account for uncertainty, and what are its key components?", "answer": "The risk analysis approach accounts for uncertainty by considering the probability of failure and the expected life of the structure. It involves calculating the risk of at least one exceedance of the design event during the design life using Equation (13.2.3). The key components of this approach include the design return period, the expected life of the structure, and the probability of failure.

The channel shape function is composed of two components: the rate of change of the hydraulic radius with respect to the flow depth and the rate of change of the cross-sectional area with respect to the flow depth. These components are dependent on the geometry of the channel and can be difficult to obtain for irregularly shaped channels."}, {"question": "How does the first-order analysis of uncertainty account for correlation between independent variables, and what are its limitations?", "answer": "The first-order analysis of uncertainty can account for correlation between independent variables by incorporating the covariance between variables into the analysis. However, this approach has limitations, as it assumes a linear relationship between the variables and neglects higher-order terms. In cases where the relationships between variables are non-linear or complex, the first-order analysis may not provide accurate results, and more advanced methods may be required to capture the uncertainty associated with the design variables."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what is the significance of the safety factor and safety margin, and how are they used?", "answer": "The safety factor and safety margin are used to account for uncertainties in hydrologic design that are difficult to quantify, such as technological, socioeconomic, political, and environmental uncertainties.

{"paragraph": "13.4 COMPOSITE RISK ANALYSIS The previous sections have introduced the concepts of inherent uncertainty due to the natural variability of hydrologic phenomena, and model and parameter uncertainty arising from the way the phenomena are analyzed. Composite risk analysis is a method of accounting for the risks resulting from the various sources of uncertainty to produce an overall risk assessment for a particular design. The concepts of loading and capacity are central to this analysis. The loading, or demand, placed on a system is the measure of the impact of external events. The demand for water supply is determined by the people who use the water. The magnitude of a flash flood depends on the characteristics of the storm producing it and on the condition of the watershed at the time of the storm. The capacity, or resistance, is the measure of the ability of the system to withstand the loading or meet the demand. If loading is denoted by L and capacity by C, then the risk of failure R is given by the probability that L exceeds C, or R= <1) (13.4.1) =P(C—L<0) The risk depends upon the probability distributions of L and C. Suppose that the probability density function of L is f(L). This function could be, for example, an Extreme Value or log—Pearson Type III probability density function for extreme values, as described earlier. Given f(L), the chance that the loading will exceed a fixed and known capacity C%* is (see Fig. 13.4.1) PL SG = [ rovae (13.4.2) The true capacity is not known exactly, but may be considered to have probability density function g(C), which could be the normal or lognormal distri- bution arising from the first-order analysis of uncertainty in the system capacity. For example, if Manning’s equation has been used to determine the capacity of a hydraulic structure, the uncertainty in C can be evaluated by first-order analysis as described above.

Assuming that L and C are independent random variables, the composite risk is evaluated by calculating the probability that loading will exceed capacity at each value in the range of feasible capacities, and integrating to obtain Zell. [ roa (C)dC (13.4.3) The reliability of a system is defined to be the probability that a system will perform its required function for a specified period of time under stated conditions (Harr, 1987).

Calculate (a) the risk of demand exceeding supply if the city’s water supply system has an estimated capacity of 5 units; (b) the risk of failure if the estimate of the capacity has a standard error of 0.75 units.

Thus, the chance that the city’s water demand will exceed its supply during the coming year, assuming the capacity to be normally distributed with mean 5 and standard deviation 0.75 is approximately 5 percent; compare this with the result of 2 percent when the capacity was considered fixed at 5 units. It is clear from Example 13.4.1 that calculation of the composite risk of failure can be a complicated exercise requiring the use of a computer to perform the necessary integration. This is especially true when more realistic distributions for the loading and capacity are chosen, such as the Extreme Value or log—Pearson Type III distributions for loading, and the lognormal distribution for capacity. Yen and co-workers at the University of Illinois (Yen, 1970; Tang and Yen, 1972; Yen, et al., 1976) and Mays and co-workers at the University of Texas at Austin (Tung and Mays, 1980; Lee and Mays, 1986) have made detailed risk analysis studies for various kinds of open-channel and pipe-flow design problems. The composite risk analysis described here is a static analysis, which means that it estimates the risk of failure under the single worst case loading on the system during its design life. A more complex dynamic risk analysis considers the possibility of a number of extreme loadings during the design life, any one of which could cause a failure; the total risk of failure includes the chance of multiple failures during the design life (Tung and Mays, 1980; Lee and Mays 1983).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of composite risk analysis, what is the relationship between loading and capacity in determining the risk of failure?", "answer": "The risk of failure, denoted by R, is given by the probability that the loading (L) exceeds the capacity (C), or R = P(C - L < 0), indicating that the risk depends on the probability distributions of both L and C."}, {"question": "How does the uncertainty in the capacity of a hydraulic structure, such as that determined by Manning's equation, affect the overall risk assessment in composite risk analysis?", "answer": "The uncertainty in the capacity can be evaluated by first-order analysis, and considering the capacity to have a probability density function, such as a normal or lognormal distribution, allows for a more realistic assessment of the risk. This is because the true capacity is not known exactly, and accounting for this uncertainty provides a more comprehensive understanding of the potential risks. For instance, in Example 13.4.1, when the capacity was considered fixed at 5 units, the risk of demand exceeding supply was approximately 2 percent, but when the capacity was considered to be normally distributed with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 0.75, the risk increased to about 5 percent, highlighting the importance of considering uncertainty in capacity."}, {"question": "Why is composite risk analysis considered a static analysis, and what are the implications of this characterization?", "answer": "Composite risk analysis is considered a static analysis because it estimates the risk of failure under the single worst-case loading on the system during its design life. This means it does not account for the possibility of multiple extreme loadings during the design life, which could lead to multiple failures. The implication of this is that static analysis may underestimate the total risk of failure, as it does not consider the cumulative effect of repeated extreme events. A more comprehensive approach would involve dynamic risk analysis, which considers the possibility of multiple failures over the design life, providing a more realistic assessment of the system's reliability."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, how do the distributions of loading and capacity influence the calculation of composite risk, and what challenges does this pose for analysis?", "answer": "The distributions of loading and capacity significantly influence the calculation of composite risk, as the risk is evaluated based on the probability that the loading exceeds the capacity. The choice of distributions for loading (such as Extreme Value or log-Pearson Type III) and capacity (such as normal or lognormal) can complicate the calculation, especially when more realistic distributions are chosen. This poses a challenge for analysis, as it often requires numerical integration and the use of computers to evaluate the risk accurately. The complexity of these calculations underscores the need for advanced computational tools and methodologies in hydrologic design to ensure accurate risk assessments."}, {"question": "What is the definition of reliability in the context of composite risk analysis, and how does it relate to the risk of failure?", "answer": "Reliability is defined as the probability that a system will perform its required function for a specified period of time under stated conditions. It is the complement of risk, or the probability that the loading will not exceed the capacity, expressed as R = 1 - R, where R is the risk of failure. This relationship highlights that as the risk of failure increases, the reliability of the system decreases, and vice versa, emphasizing the importance of minimizing risk to maximize system reliability."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the uncertainty in both loading and capacity when conducting a composite risk analysis?", "answer": "Considering the uncertainty in both loading and capacity is crucial because it provides a more realistic and comprehensive assessment of the risk. Uncertainty in loading accounts for the natural variability of hydrologic phenomena, while uncertainty in capacity reflects the limitations and inaccuracies in the analysis and modeling of the system. By accounting for both, the analysis can better capture the potential risks and provide a more accurate estimate of the system's reliability, which is essential for making informed decisions in hydrologic design and management."}, {"question": "In the context of Example 13.4.1, how does the assumption of normally distributed loading and capacity affect the calculation of the risk of failure?", "answer": "The assumption of normally distributed loading and capacity simplifies the calculation of the risk of failure, as it allows for the use of well-established statistical methods and distributions. However, this assumption may not always reflect real-world conditions, where distributions might be more complex. In Example 13.4.1, the normal distribution assumption enables a straightforward calculation of the risk when the capacity is considered fixed and when it is considered to be normally distributed, illustrating how different assumptions about distribution can impact the estimated risk of failure."}, {"question": "How does dynamic risk analysis differ from static risk analysis in the context of hydrologic design, and what are the implications of this difference?", "answer": "Dynamic risk analysis differs from static risk analysis in that it considers the possibility of multiple extreme loadings during the design life of a system, which"}]}
{"paragraph": "13.5 RISK ANALYSIS OF SAFETY MARGINS AND SAFETY FACTORS Safety Margin The safety margin was defined in Eq. (13.2.5) as the difference between the project capacity and the value calculated for the design loading SM=C — L. From (13.4.1), the risk of failure R is R=P(C —L <0) (1325.1) = P(SM <0) If C and L are independent random variables, then the mean value of SM is given by MsM = Kc — BL (HIBS2 ) and its variance by ee 2 a so the standard deviation, or standard error of estimate, of the safety margin is 1/2 (13.5.4) osm = (02 Tt ig If the safety margin is normally distributed, then (SM—j15yy)/osm is a standard HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 437 normal variate z.

The risk of failure under the stated conditions is R = 0.055, or 5.5%. Note that this method of analysis assumes that the safety margin is normally distributed but does not specify what the distributions of loading and capacity must be. Ang (1973) indicates that, provided R > 0.001, R is not greatly influenced by the choice of distributions for L and C, and the assumption of a normal distribution for SM is satisfactory. For lower risk than this (e.g., R = 0.00001), the shapes of the tails of the distributions for L and C become critical, and in this case, the full composite risk analysis described in Sec. 13.4 should be used to evaluate the risk of failure. Safety Factor The safety factor SF is given by the ratio C/L and the risk of failure can be expressed as P(SF < 1). By taking logarithms of both sides of this inequality 438 APPLIED HYDROLOGY R=P(SF < 1) = P(In(SF) < 0) (13.5.6) =P{in =< 0} If the capacity and loading are independent and lognormally distributed, then the risk can be expressed (Huang, 1986) Weel Cy bi\\1 + CV?

For the same problem (Example 13.5.1) assuming that the safety margin was normally distributed, the risk was found to be 5.5 percent; the risk level has not changed greatly with use of the lognormal instead of the normal distribution. Risk-Safety Factor—Return Period Relationship A common design practice is to choose a return period and determine the corre- sponding loading L as the design capacity of a hydraulic structure. The safety factor is inherently built into the choice of the return period. Alternatively, the loading value can be multiplied by a safety factor SF; then the structure is designed for capacity C = SF xX L. As discussed in this chapter, there are various kinds of uncertainty associated both with L and with the capacity C of the structure as designed. By composite risk analysis, a risk of failure can be calculated for the selected return period and safety factor. The result of such a calculation is shown HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 439 Ui 6 DISse2 5 5 45 1 : & PS 5> , 2r0i Return pe period ye(yaerarss) 6 50 > 100 1 ana 1 0.00002 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1.0 Risk of failure (year ') FIGURE 13.5.1 The risk—safety factor—return period relationship for culvert design on the Glade River near Reston, Virginia. The probability distribution for loading used to develop this figure was the Extreme Value Type I distribution of annual maximum floods. A lognormal distribution for the culvert capacity was developed using first-order analysis of uncertainty. The risk level for given return period and safety factor was determined using composite risk analysis. (Source: Tung and Mays, 1980.) in Fig. 13.5.1, which shows a risk chart applying to culvert design on the Glade River near Reston, Virginia. The risk values in the chart represent annual prob- abilities of failure. For example, if the return period is 100 years and the safety factor 1.0, the risk of failure is 0.015 or 1.5 percent in any given year, while if the safety factor is increased to 2, the risk of failure is reduced to R = 0.006, or 0.6 percent in any given year. Current hydrologic design practice copes with the inherent uncertainty of hydrologic phenomena by the selection of the design return period, and with model and parameter uncertainty by the assignment of arbitrary safety factors or safety margins. The risks and uncertainties can be evaluated more systematically using the procedures provided by first-order analysis of uncertainty and composite risk analysis as presented here. However, it must be borne in mind that just as any function of random variables is itself a random variable, the estimates of risk and reliability provided by these methods also have uncertainty associated with them, and their true values can never be determined exactly.

If a water supply design is based on this drought and the design life is 50 years, what is the chance that a worse drought will occur during the design life? 13.2.2 In Prob. 13.2.1, what is the chance that a worse drought will occur during the first 10 years of the design life? The first 20 years? 13.2.3. What is the chance that the largest flood observed in 50 years of record will be exceeded during the next 10 years? The next 20 years? 13.2.4 If a structure has a design life of 15 years, calculate the required design return period if the acceptable risk of failure is 20 percent (a) in any year, (b) over the design life. HYDROLOGIC DESIGN 441 13.2.5 A flood plain regulation prevents construction within the 25-year flood plain. What is the risk that a structure built just on the edge of this flood plain will be flooded during the next 10 years? By how much would this risk be reduced if construction were limited to the edge of the 100-year flood plain? 13.2.6 A house has a 30-year design life. What is the chance it will be flooded during its design life if it is located on the edge of the 25-year flood plain? The 100- year flood plain? 13.2.7 Determine the optimum scale of development (return period) for the flood-control measure considered in Example 13.2.3 if the annual capital costs given in Table 13.2.1 are doubled. Use the same damage costs as in Table 13.2.1. 13.2.8 Determine the optimum scale of development (return period) for the flood-control measure considered in Example 13.2.3, if the damage costs are doubled. Annual capital costs remain the same as in Table 13.2.1. 13.2.9 Determine the optimum scale of development (return period) for the flood control measure considered in Example 13.2.3, if the damage costs and the annual capital costs are both doubled. 13.3.1 A rectangular channel is 200 feet wide, has bed slope 0.5 percent, an estimated Manning’s n of 0.040, and a design discharge of 10,000 cfs. Calculate the design flow depth. If the coefficient of variation of the design discharge is 0.20 and of Manning’s n is 0.15, calculate the standard error of estimate of the flow depth. What is the probability that the actual water level will be more than | foot deeper than the expected value? Within what range can the water level for the design event be expected in 70 percent of events? 13.3.2 In Prob. 13.3.1, calculate dy/dQ and dy/dn for the conditions given (Q = 10,000 cfs and n = 0.040) and solve the problem using these derivatives. 13.3.3 Solve Prob. 13.3.1 if the channel is trapezoidal with bottom width 150 ft and side slopes 1 vert. = 3 hor.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what is the primary purpose of conducting a risk analysis of safety margins and safety factors?", "answer": "The primary purpose of conducting a risk analysis of safety margins and safety factors in hydrologic design is to systematically evaluate the risks and uncertainties associated with hydrologic phenomena, model uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, thereby providing a more informed approach to design decisions."}, {"question": "How do safety margins and safety factors relate to the risk of failure in hydrologic design, and what methods can be used to calculate this risk?", "answer": "Safety margins and safety factors are directly related to the risk of failure, as they determine the capacity of a hydraulic structure to withstand design loads. The risk of failure can be calculated using methods such as first-order analysis of uncertainty and composite risk analysis, which take into account the distributions of loading and capacity. For instance, if the safety margin is normally distributed, the risk can be calculated using the standard normal distribution function, as shown in Eq. (13.5.5). This approach allows designers to quantify the risk of failure and make more informed decisions about design parameters."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the distributions of loading and capacity when evaluating the risk of failure in hydrologic design, and what are the implications of assuming a normal distribution for the safety margin?", "answer": "Considering the distributions of loading and capacity is crucial because they directly affect the risk of failure. Assuming a normal distribution for the safety margin can be satisfactory for risks greater than 0.001, as indicated by Ang (1973). However, for lower risks, the shapes of the tails of the distributions for loading and capacity become critical, and a full composite risk analysis should be used. This is because the normal distribution may not accurately capture the extreme values that are most relevant to failure scenarios, potentially leading to underestimation of the true risk."}, {"question": "In the context of lognormally distributed capacity and loading, how can the risk of failure be expressed, and what are the key factors influencing this risk?", "answer": "For lognormally distributed capacity and loading, the risk of failure can be expressed using Eq. (13.5.7), which involves the coefficients of variation of capacity and loading. The key factors influencing this risk include the coefficients of variation (CV) of capacity and loading, as they determine the variability and uncertainty of these parameters. A higher CV indicates greater uncertainty, which in turn increases the risk of failure. This highlights the importance of accurately estimating these coefficients to ensure reliable design and risk assessment."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the return period, safety factor, and risk of failure in hydrologic design, and how can this relationship be used to inform design decisions?", "answer": "The return period, safety factor, and risk of failure are interrelated in hydrologic design. A higher return period or safety factor generally reduces the risk of failure. This relationship can be visualized using risk charts, such as the one shown in Fig. 13.5.1, which allows designers to select appropriate design parameters based on acceptable risk levels. By understanding this relationship, designers can balance the costs of design and construction with the risks of failure, leading to more economical and reliable designs."}, {"question": "How does the choice of distribution for loading and capacity affect the calculation of the risk of failure, and what are the implications for design practice?", "answer": "The choice of distribution for loading and capacity significantly affects the calculation of the risk of failure. Different distributions can lead to varying estimates of risk, with the normal distribution being commonly used for its simplicity. However, as discussed, for very low risks, the assumption of a normal distribution may not be adequate, and more detailed analyses considering the actual distributions of loading and capacity are necessary. This implies that design practice should be flexible and adapt to the specific characteristics of the project, considering both the economic and safety implications of design choices."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why is it challenging to determine the true values of risk and reliability, and what are the limitations of current methods?", "answer": "Determining the true values of risk and reliability in hydrologic design is challenging because any function of random variables is itself a random variable, meaning that estimates of risk and reliability also have uncertainty associated with them. Current methods, such as first-order analysis of uncertainty and composite risk analysis, provide systematic approaches to evaluating risks but are limited by the accuracy of input data and the assumptions made about the distributions of variables. These limitations underscore the need for ongoing research and refinement of design methodologies to improve the accuracy and reliability of hydrologic design."}, {"question": "How do current hydrologic design practices cope with the inherent uncertainty of hydrologic phenomena, and what are the potential drawbacks of these approaches?", "answer": "Current hydrologic design practices primarily cope with uncertainty through the selection of design return periods and the assignment of arbitrary safety factors or margins. While these approaches provide a degree of conservatism, they may not fully account for all sources of"}]}
{"paragraph": "13.3.4 Flow in a natural stream channel has been modeled by a computer program and found to have a depth of 15 ft for a flow rate of 8000 cfs and Manning’s n value of 0.045. Rerunning the program shows that changing the design discharge by 1000 cfs changes the water surface elevation by 0.8 ft, and changing Manning’s n by 0.005 changes the water surface elevation by 0.6 ft. If the design discharge is assumed to be accurate to + 30 percent and Manning’s n to + 10 percent, calculate the corresponding error in the flow depth (or water surface elevation). 13.3.5 Suppose for the conditions given in Example 13.3.1, solved in the text, that the channel wall height adopted is 8.4 ft, that is, the calculated depth of 7.4 ft plus a 1.0 ft freeboard, or safety margin. What safety factor SF is implied by this choice? What would the safety factor be if the true Manning’s roughness were 0.045 instead of the 0.035 assumed?

Calculate the risk of failure if the capacity is 12 units. Assume normal distribution for the loading. 13.4.2 Solve Prob. 13.4.1 if the loading is lognormally distributed. 13.4.3 In Prob. 13.4.1, assume that the capacity is normally distributed with mean 12 units and standard deviation 1 unit. Recompute the risk of failure, assuming that the loading is also normally distributed.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flow modeling in natural stream channels, how does the change in design discharge affect the water surface elevation?", "answer": "According to the computer program, changing the design discharge by 1000 cfs changes the water surface elevation by 0.8 ft. This indicates a direct relationship between discharge and water surface elevation, where an increase in discharge leads to an increase in water surface elevation. The magnitude of this change suggests that even moderate adjustments in discharge can significantly impact the water level, which is crucial for flood plain management and design considerations."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the accuracy of Manning's n value in flow modeling, and what are the implications of its uncertainty?", "answer": "Manning's n value is a critical parameter in flow modeling as it affects the calculated water surface elevation. The given example shows that changing Manning's n by 0.005 changes the water surface elevation by 0.6 ft, indicating that small variations in Manning's n can lead to notable changes in the predicted water level. This highlights the importance of accurately determining Manning's n to ensure reliable flow modeling and design. Uncertainty in Manning's n can lead to errors in predicting flood levels, which can have significant implications for flood protection measures and the safety of structures and communities."}, {"question": "In the context of channel design, what safety factor is implied by adopting a channel wall height with a 1.0 ft freeboard, and how does the true Manning's roughness affect this safety factor?", "answer": "The adoption of a channel wall height with a 1.0 ft freeboard implies a safety factor, as it provides an additional margin above the calculated depth to account for uncertainties and potential errors. The safety factor would be affected if the true Manning's roughness were different from the assumed value, as this would alter the calculated depth and thus the adequacy of the freeboard. For instance, if the true Manning's roughness were 0.045 instead of the assumed 0.035, the calculated depth would increase, potentially reducing the safety factor and impacting the design's reliability."}, {"question": "How does the uncertainty in cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter, as obtained from topographic maps, affect the risk of flooding, and what are the implications for flood plain studies?", "answer": "The uncertainty in cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter, with coefficients of variation of 20 percent from topographic maps, introduces additional risk in flood plain studies. This uncertainty can lead to inaccuracies in predicting water levels and flood extents, potentially underestimating or overestimating the flood risk. The use of topographic maps instead of ground surveys for determining channel cross sections can thus increase the risk that houses will flood during the design event, emphasizing the need for precise data in flood plain delineation to ensure accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why is it crucial to consider the distribution of the loading, such as normal or lognormal distribution, when calculating the risk of failure?", "answer": "The distribution of the loading significantly affects the calculation of the risk of failure because different distributions have different probabilities of exceeding a certain threshold. For example, a lognormally distributed loading may have a higher probability of extreme values compared to a normally distributed loading, which can substantially impact the risk assessment. Considering the correct distribution of the loading is essential to accurately estimate the risk of failure and to design structures or systems that can safely withstand the expected loads, thereby ensuring the reliability and safety of hydrologic designs."}, {"question": "How does the assumption of normal distribution for both loading and capacity affect the computation of the risk of failure in hydrologic design?", "answer": "When both the loading and capacity are assumed to be normally distributed, the computation of the risk of failure involves considering the overlap of these distributions. The risk of failure is the probability that the loading exceeds the capacity, which can be calculated using the properties of normal distributions. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the risk, as it accounts for the variability in both the loading and the capacity, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the design's reliability and safety margin."}, {"question": "In the context of flood plain management, what are the challenges and implications of using topographic maps versus ground surveys for determining channel cross sections?", "answer": "Using topographic maps instead of ground surveys for determining channel cross sections introduces challenges due to the potential for significant uncertainty in the cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter. This uncertainty can lead to inaccuracies in flood plain delineation, affecting the assessment of flood risk and the design of flood protection measures. The implications include potential underestimation or overestimation of flood risks, which can have significant consequences for flood plain management, including inadequate protection of structures and communities, or unnecessary expenditures on flood mitigation measures. Therefore, the choice between using topographic maps or ground surveys should be based on a careful consideration of the required accuracy, the potential risks, and the available resources."}]}

The annual demand for these transfers was estimated to be 1.48 MAF (million acre-feet) in 1980, and is projected to rise linearly to 1.77 MAF in 1990. Study of observed annual demands from 1980 to 1985 indicates that the coefficient of variation of observed annual demands around those expected is approximately 0.1 (this variability is due to year-to-year variations in weather and other factors).

This variability suggests that there is some uncertainty in predicting the exact demand from year to year, which can impact water management planning."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating water demand, why is it important to consider the probability of exceeding a certain demand level, such as 2.0 MAF/year, in 1986 and 1990?", "answer": "Considering the probability of exceeding a certain demand level is crucial for planning and management purposes, as it helps in understanding the risk associated with meeting the water demands. By estimating the chance that observed demands will exceed 2.0 MAF/year, water managers can prepare for potential shortages or surpluses, ensuring a more resilient water supply system. This analysis is particularly important in regions like southern California, where water scarcity is a significant concern."}, {"question": "What is the assumption about the distribution of annual demands for water transfers, and how does this assumption affect the calculation of the chance that observed demands will exceed a certain level?", "answer": "The annual demands for water transfers are assumed to be normally distributed. This assumption allows for the use of standard statistical methods to calculate the probability of exceeding a certain demand level, such as 2.0 MAF/year.

The formula involves the standard normal distribution function and considers the variability in both capacity and loading, providing a more nuanced understanding of the risk involved. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where both the capacity to supply water and the demand for it are subject to significant variability."}, {"question": "In the context of open channel design, why is it important to calculate the risk of failure, and how does the distribution of safety margin affect this calculation?", "answer": "Calculating the risk of failure in open channel design is critical to ensure the safety and reliability of the channel. The distribution of the safety margin, which is the difference between the capacity of the channel and the loading, plays a significant role in determining this risk. If the safety margin is normally distributed, the risk of failure can be calculated using specific statistical methods. However, if the capacity and loading are lognormally distributed, a different approach must be taken, considering the coefficients of variation of these parameters to accurately assess the risk of channel failure."}, {"question": "What factors contribute to the variability in the capacity of an open channel, and how are these factors considered in the calculation of the risk of failure?", "answer": "The variability in the capacity of an open channel can be attributed to several factors, including the slope of the channel, the Manning’s roughness factor, and the dimensions of the channel cross-section. These factors are considered in the calculation of the risk of failure by incorporating their coefficients of variation into the analysis. For instance, the coefficient of variation of the slope (CVs) and the Manning’s roughness factor (CVn) are used to estimate the overall variability in channel capacity, which is then used to calculate the risk of failure due to overtopping."}, {"question": "How does the assumption of lognormal distribution for capacity and loading affect the calculation of risk in hydrologic design, compared to a normal distribution assumption?", "answer": "The assumption of a lognormal distribution for capacity and loading introduces a different approach to calculating risk in hydrologic design. Unlike the normal distribution, which assumes symmetry around the mean, lognormal distributions are skewed, reflecting the natural variability often observed in hydrological parameters. This skewness affects the calculation of risk, as it implies that extreme values (either very high or very low) are more likely than under a normal distribution. Consequently, the formulas used to approximate risk under lognormal distributions account for this skewness, providing a more realistic assessment of the risks"}]}

CHAPTER 14 DESIGN STORMS A design storm is a precipitation pattern defined for use in the design of a hydro- logic system. Usually the design storm serves as the system input, and the result- ing rates of flow through the system are calculated using rainfall-runoff and flow routing procedures. A design storm can be defined by a value for precipitation depth at a point, by a design hyetograph specifying the time distribution of pre- cipitation during a storm, or by an isohyetal map specifying the spatial pattern of the precipitation. Design storms can be based upon historical precipitation data at a site or can be constructed using the general characteristics of precipitation in the surrounding region. Their application ranges from the use of point precipitation values in the rational method for determining peak flow rates in storm sewers and highway culverts, to the use of storm hyetographs as inputs for rainfall-runoff analysis of urban detention basins or for spillway design in large reservoir projects.

{"paragraph": "14.1 DESIGN PRECIPITATION DEPTH Point Precipitation Point precipitation is precipitation occurring at a single point in space as opposed to areal precipitation which is precipitation over a region. For point precipitation frequency analysis, the annual maximum precipitation for a given duration is a4 DESIGN STORMS 445 selected by applying the method outlined ini Sec. 3.4. to all storms in a year, for each year of historical record. This process is repeated for each of a series of durations. For each duration, frequency analysis is performed on the data, as described in Sec. 12.2, to derive the design precipitation depths for various return periods; then the design depths are converted to intensities by dividing by the precipitation duration. By analyzing data in this way, Hershfield (1961) developed isohyetal maps of design rainfall depth for the entire United States; these were published in U. S. Weather Bureau technical paper no. 40, commonly called TP 40. The maps presented in TP 40 are for durations from 30 minutes to 24 hours and return periods from 1 to 100 years. Hershfield also furnished interpolation diagrams for making precipitation estimates for durations and return periods not shown on the maps. Fig. 14.1.1 shows the TP 40 map for 100-year 24-hour rainfall. The U. S. Weather Bureau (1964) later published maps for durations of 2 to 10 days. In many design situations, such as storm sewer design, durations of 30 minutes or less must be considered. In a publication commonly known as HYDRO 35 (Frederick, Meyers, and Auciello, 1977), the U.

Solution. Oklahoma City is located near the center of the state of Oklahoma and the values of 15- and 60-minute precipitation for 2- and 100-year return periods are read from Fig. 14.1.2 as P21; = 1.02 in, Pjoois = 1.86 in, P2 60 = 1.85 in, and P0060 = 3.80 in, respectively.

DESIGN stoRMS 453 Areal Precipitation Depth Frequency analysis of precipitation over an area has not been as well developed as has analysis of point precipitation. In the absence of information on the true probability distribution of areal precipitation, point precipitation estimates are usually extended to develop an average precipitation depth over an area. The areal estimate may be either storm-centered or location-fixed. For the location-fixed case, one accounts for the fact that precipitation stations are sometimes near the storm center, sometimes on the outer edges, and sometimes in between the two. An averaging process results in location-fixed depth-area curves relating areal precipitation to point measurements. Fig. 14.1.3 provides curves for calculating areal depths as a percentage of point precipitation values (World Meteorological Organization, 1983). Depth-area relationships for various durations, such as those shown in Fig. 14.1.3, are derived by a depth-area-duration analysis, in which isohyetal maps are prepared for each duration from the tabulation of maximum n-hour rainfalls recorded in a densely gaged area. The area contained within each isohyet on these maps is determined and a graph of average precipitation depth vs. area is plotted for each duration.

INTENSITY-DURATION-FREQUENCY RELATIONSHIPS One of the first steps in many hydrologic design projects, such as in urban drainage design, is the determination of the rainfall event or events to be used. The most common approach is to use a design storm or event that involves a relationship between rainfall intensity (or depth), duration, and the frequency or return period appropriate for the facility and site location. In many cases, the hydrologist has standard intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves available for the site and does not have to perform this analysis. However, it is worthwhile to understand the procedure used to develop the relationships. Usually, the informa- tion is presented as a graph, with duration plotted on the horizontal axis, intensity on the vertical axis, and a series of curves, one for each design return period, as illustrated for Chicago in Fig. 14.2.1. The intensity is the time rate of precipitation, that is, depth per unit time (mnv/h or in/h). It can be either the instantaneous intensity or the average intensity over the duration of the rainfall. The average intensity is commonly used and can be expressed as jae a (14.2.1) LO era tahore Nee) TPoaT SR ail Eh i a SRni ei Oeee te 8 cee See eeea E Pela) rei Thali Wl SReres see KS SS EEE 7 Soe toetI e T el als SG) Sete enc | ECE SRS L a, AR —— S eS J G U S So eq (69 Pielat = et Sess ORNS BST LAT SORES = eidgakl Nae ALAS Retum i 8 2 LLL N U U N S E .

The frequency is usually expressed in terms of return period, T, which is the average length of time between precipitation events that equal or exceed the design magnitude. minute duration storm with a 5-year return period in Chicago. Solution. From the IDF curves for Chicago (Fig. 14.2.1), the design intensity for a 5-year, 20-minute storm is i = 3.50 in/h. The corresponding precipitation depth is given by Eq. (14.2.1) with Tz = 20 min=0.333 h. P=iT, = 3.50 x 0.333 =1.17 in Eqs. (14.1.1) and (14.1.2) to plot IDF curves for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years. Consider rainfall durations ranging from 5 minutes to | hour. Solution. The six maps presented in Fig. 14.1.2 show precipitation for 5-, 15-, and 60-minute durations and 2- and 100-year return periods. The six values for Oklahoma City from these maps are: P25 = 0.48 in, Pjoo,5 = 0.87 in, P2.15 = 1.02 in, P 100,15 = 1)fe Xs) in, P> 60 ='1).85 in, P 100,60 = 3.80 in. For T = 2 and 100 yr, the precipitation for 10- and 30-minute durations is obtained by interpolation from the 5-, 15-, and 60-minute values using (14.1.1) as illustrated in Example 14.1.1. For each duration, the values for return period T = 5, 10, 25, and 50 yr are obtained using the values at TJ = 2 and 100 yr by interpolation using (14.1.2) and Table 14.1.1, as also illustrated in Example 14.1.1. The results are shown in dividing by duration. For example, P2539 = 2.30 in, so the corresponding intensity is i = P/T, = 2.30 in/0.50 h = 4.60 in/h. The resulting precipitation intensities for each duration and return period are plotted in Fig. 14.2.2.

(14.1.1) and (14.1.2). 456 APPLIED HYDROLOGY IDF Curves by Frequency Analysis When local rainfall data are available, IDF curves can be developed using fre- quency analysis. A commonly used distribution for rainfall frequency analysis is the Extreme Value Type I or Gumbel distribution as discussed in Sec. 12.2. For each duration selected, the annual maximum rainfall depths are extracted from historical rainfall records, then frequency analysis is applied to the annual data. In some situations, particularly when only a few years of data are available (less than 20 to 25 years), an annual exceedence series for each duration may be determined by ranking the depths and choosing the N largest values from a record of N years. Such a series is shown in Table 14.2.2 for a rain gage at Coshocton, Ohio. In the table, the lines connect precipitation data for various durations of the same storm event. The design precipitation depths determined from the annual exceedence series can then be adjusted to match those derived from an annual maximum series by multiplying the depths by 0.88 for the 2-year return period values, 0.96 for the 5-year return period values, and 0.99 for the 10-year return period values (Hershfield, 1961). No adjustment of the estimates is required for longer return periods.

Using (12.3.8), Kz = —(6/7)(0.5772 + In{ In[7/(T— 1)]}}) = —(J6/m{0.5772 + In[{In[2/1]} = —0.164; the corresponding value for T = 25 yr is Ky, = 2.044. Then, using (12.3.3) for a two-year return period, X2,15=X15 + K515 =0.799 — 0.164 x 0.154 =0.774 in Because the data in Table 14.2.2 are an annual exceedence series, this value is multiplied by 0.88 to obtain the design precipitation depth 0.774 xX 0.88 = 0.68 in for a two-year return period. For a 25-year return period 25,15 =Xis + Kr5515 =0.799 + 2.044 x 0.154 =1.11 in This value is not adjusted because its return period is greater than 10 years. Equations for IDF Curves Intensity-duration-frequency curves have also been expressed as equations to avoid having to read the design rainfall intensity from a graph. For example, Wenzel (1982) provided coefficients from a number of cities in the United States for an equation of the form puso (14.2.2) Toe f where i is the design rainfall intensity, Ty is the duration, and c, e, and f are coefficients varying with location and return period. Table 14.2.3 shows values of these coefficients for a 10-year return period in 10 U. S. cities.

Huff (1967) developed time distribution relations for 460 = APPLIED HYDROLOGY heavy storms on areas ranging up to 400 mi? in Illinois. Time distribution patterns were developed for four probability groups, from the most severe (first quartile) to the least severe (fourth quartile). Fig. 14.3.1(a) shows the probability distribution of first-quartile storms. These curves are smooth, reflecting average rainfall distribution with time; they do not exhibit the burst characteristics of observed storms. Fig. 14.3.1(b) shows selected histograms of first-quartile storms for 10-, 50-, and 90-percent cumulative probabilities of occurrence, each illustrating the percentage of total storm rainfall for 10 percent increments of the storm duration. The 50 percent histogram represents a cumulative rainfall pattern that should be exceeded in about half of the storms.

These hyetographs were derived from informa- tion presented by Hershfield (1961) and Miller, Frederick, and Tracey (1973) and additional storm data. Table 14.3.1 and Fig. 14.3.2 present the cumulative hyetographs. There are four 24-hour duration storms, called Types I, IA, II, and III, respectively; Figure 14.3.3 shows the geographic location within the United States where they should be applied. Types I and JA are for the Pacific maritime climate with wet winters and dry summers. Type III is for the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coastal areas, where tropical storms result in large 24-hour rainfall amounts. Type II is for the remainder of the nation. Pilgrim and Cordery (1975) developed a hyetograph analysis method that is based on ranking the time intervals in a storm by the depth of precipitation occurring in each, and repeating this exercise for many storms in the region. By summing the ranks for each interval, a typical hyetograph shape can be obtained. This approach is a standard method in Australian hydrologic design (The Institution of Engineers Australia, 1987).

{"paragraph": "14.4 DESIGN PRECIPITATION HYETOGRAPHS FROM IDF RELATIONSHIPS In the hydrologic design methods developed many years ago, such as the rational method, only the peak discharge was used. There was no consideration of the time distribution of discharge (the discharge hydrograph) or the time distribution of precipitation (the precipitation hyetograph). However, more recently developed design methods, using unsteady flow analysis, require reliable prediction of the design hyetograph to obtain design hydrographs. 466 apPLIED HYDROLOGY Alternating Block Method The alternating block method is a simple way of developing a design hyetograph from an intensity-duration-frequency curve. The design hyetograph produced by this method specifies the precipitation depth occurring in n successive time inter- vals of duration At over a total duration Tz = nAt. After selecting the design return period, the intensity is read from the IDF curve for each of the durations At, 2At, 3At, . . . , and the corresponding precipitation depth found as the product of intensity and duration. By taking differences between successive precipitation depth values, the amount of precipitation to be added for each additional unit of time Ar is found. These increments, or blocks, are reordered into a time sequence with the maximum intensity occurring at the center of the required duration Tg and the remaining blocks arranged in descending order alternately to the right and left of the central block to form the design hyetograph. hyetograph for a 2-hour storm in Denver with a 10-year return period. Solution. As was illustrated in Example 14.2.4, the 10-year precipitation intensity for a given duration can be calculated for Denver by Eq. (14.2.2) with c = 96.6, e = 0.97, and f = 13.90. For a duration of 20 minutes, this computation yields i = 3.00 in/h. The values for other durations at intervals of 10 minutes are shown in column 2 of Table 14.4.1. By multiplying intensity and duration, the corresponding precipitation depth is calculated. For a 20-minute duration P = iTz=(3.00 in/h) X 0.333 = 1.001 in; similar calcuiations for the other durations are shown in column 3 of Table 14.4.1. It can be seen that the cumulative depth increases with duration up to the 2-hour or 120-minute limit. A design precipitation hyetograph developed in 10-min increments for a 10- year 2-hour storm at Denver, using the alternating block method (Example 14.4.1) Column: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Duration Intensity Cumulative Incremental Time Precipitation depth depth (min) (in/h) (in) (in) (mii) (in) 10 4.158 0.693 0.693 0-10 0.024 20 3.002 1.001 0.308 10-20 0.033 30 2.357 1.178 0.178 20-30 0.050 40 1.943 1.296 0.117 30-40 0.084 50 1.655 1.379 0.084 40-50 0.178 60 1.443 1.443 0.063 50-60 0.693 70 1.279 1.492 0.050 60-70 0.308 80 1.149 1.533 0.040 70-80 0.117 90 1.044 1.566 0.033 80-90 0.063 100 0.956 1.594 0.028 90-100 0.040 110 0.883 1.618 0.024 100-110 0.028 120 0.820 1.639 0.021 110-120 0.021 _—_———— ——_—_—___-«—K—rrrrnnn DESIGN STORMS 467 The 10-minute precipitation depth is 0.693 in compared with 1.001 in for 20 minutes, so during the most intense 20 minutes of the design storm, 0.693 in will fall in 10 minutes, while 1.001 — 0.693 = 0.308 in will fall in the remaining 10 minutes. Using this reasoning and taking successive increments of cumulative precipitation depth, as shown in column 4 of Table 14.4.1, the precipitation depth added by each additional increment of storm duration is found. In column 6 the precipitation depths, are ordered so that the maximum block (0.693 in) falls at 50- 60 min; the next-largest block (0.308 in) is placed to the right of the maximum block, at 60-70 min (making 1.00 in between 50 and 70 min, as required), the third-largest block (0.178 in) is placed to the left of the maximum block (40-50 min), and so on. The results are plotted in Fig. 14.4.1, and the descending order of the blocks to the left and right of the maximum block can be seen. A design hyetograph built up in this way represents a 10-year event both for the 2-hour total duration and for any period within this duration centered on the maximum block. Instantaneous Intensity Method If an equation defining the intensity-duration-frequency curve is known, equations can be developed for the variation of intensity with time in the design hyetograph. The principle is similar to that employed in the alternating block method, namely that the precipitation depth for a period of duration Tz around the storm’s peak is equal to the value given by the IDF curve or equation. The difference from the alternating block method is that precipitation intensity is now considered to vary continuously throughout the storm. Consider a storm hyetograph as shown in Fig. 14.4.2. The dashed horizontal line drawn on the hyetograph for a given precipitation intensity i will intersect the hyetograph before and after the peak. Measured from the time of the peak intensity, the time of intersection before the peak is labeled t, and that after the peak t,. The total time between intersections is labeled Tg so that Ty = ta + te (14.4.1) P(irne)c ipitation FIGURE 14.4.1 A 10-year 2-hour design hyetograph developed for Denver using the alternating block method (Example Time (min) 14.4.1). 468 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Precipitation ; : ESR, (peoe es intensity : d : fy ee elon geet Time FIGURE 14.4.2 (8 ely Fitting a hyetograph by curves.

Solution. A value of r = 0.5 and a storm duration of 120 minutes will put the peak intensity at time t = 60 min measured from the beginning of the storm. The relative times t, and ¢t, before and after the peak time are shown in column 2 of Table 14.4.2. A 2-minute time interval is used near the peak for increased accuracy, and a 10-minute time interval for the remainder. The rainfall intensities are calculated by Eq. (14.4.9) using values c = 96.6, e = 0.97, andf = 13.9 from Table 14.2.3; r = 0.5; and Ty given by (14.4.3). c{(1 —e)Té meal } igs fail «2 (3 +f) Before the peak, 7, = t,/r, so for t = 50 min, for example, t, = 60 — 50 =10 min and T, = t,/r = 10/0.5 = 20 min; hence, _ 96.6[(1 — 0.97)20°7 + 13.9] ok (209-97 + 13.9)? = 1.348 in/h Similarly calculated values for all time intervals are shown in column 3 of Table 14.4.2. The values of intensity after the peak are calculated by the same procedure. using Tz = t,/(1 — r). For example, at t = 70 min, t, = 70 — 60 = 10 min and Tz = 10/(1 — 0.5) = 20 min, so i, = 1.348 in/h for this case also. The values of precipitation intensity so determined are instantaneous values; the precipitation depth in each time interval may be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. For example, referring to Table 14.4.2, the precipitation depth during the first 10 minutes is [(0.118 + 0.156)/2] X (10/60) = 0.023 in as shown in column 4. The sum of all the precipitation increments is 1.697 in, which is slightly higher than the actual precipitation depth of 1.64 in for a 10-year 2-hour storm in Denver, calculated in Example 14.4.1. The difference arises from the discretization of the continuous time scale in this example and the use of a simple trapezoidal rule to 470 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Calculation of the 10-year 2-hour design hyetograph at Denver by the instantaneous intensity method (Example 14.4.2) eee ee Column: 1 2 3 4 Time Relative time Intensity Incremental t ta, th precipitation (min) (min) (in/h) (in) 0 60 + 0.118 10 50 0.156 0.023 20 40 0.219 0.031 30 30 0.334 0.046 40 20 0.585 0.077 50 10 1.348 0.161 52 8 1.691 0.051 54 6 2.193 0.065 56 4 2.975 0.086 58 2 fa 4.303 0.121 60 0 6.950 0.188 62 72 t, 4.303 0.188 64 4 2.975 0.121 66 6 2.193 0.086 68 8 1.691 0.065 70 10 1.348 0.051 80 20 0.585 0.161 90 30 0.334 0.077 100 40 0.219 0.046 110 50 0.156 0.031 120 60 0.118 0.023 Total depth (in) 1.697 calculate precipitation depth.

Different values of r result in hyetographs with the peak intensity occurring at different times, which can impact the design of hydrologic systems.

{"paragraph": "14.5 ESTIMATED LIMITING STORMS The estimated limiting values (ELV’s) commonly employed for water control design are the probable maximum precipitation (PMP), the probable maximum storm (PMS), and the probable maximum flood (PMF), although many other possible ELV’s could be developed as criteria for various types of hydrologic design. The PMP provides only a depth of precipitation, the time distribution of which must be defined to form a PMS. The PMS can be employed as the input DESIGN sToRMS 471 a~ Teeaseee >i) a Ww N FIGURE 14.4.3 Ep Design hyetographs for a 10-year Pi(nirnte/echni)sp iittya tion iis storm at Denver developed by the instantaneous intensity method 0 i) ie ph with advancement coefficients 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 r = 0.25 and 0.5 (Example Time (min) 14.4.2). to a rainfall-runoff model of a drainage basin system which can then be used to develop a PMF for the design of runoff control structures. Probable Maximum Precipitation The PMP is the estimated limiting value of precipitation. Consequently, the PMP may be defined as the analytically estimated greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible and reasonably characteristic over a particular geographical region at a certain time of year. In practice, no allowance is made in the estimation of the PMP for the effects of long-term climatic change. It must be remembered that the concept of PMP is not completely reliable because it cannot be perfectly estimated and its probability of occurrence is unknown. However, in operational application, the PMP has been found to be useful, and its use will continue because of public concern for safety of projects such as large dams. There are a variety of methods for determining the PMP. Because of the uncertainties and limitations of data and knowledge, the PMP must be considered an estimate and judgment must be used in setting its value. Methods of estimating PMP are discussed below. 1. Application of storm models. Storm models may be employed to esti- mate PMP where there is insufficient or nonrepresentative storm data, or where there is rugged topography that complicates the storm phenomenon and makes precipitation measurement difficult. The convective cell model for thunderstorms presented in Sec. 3.3 is one example of a storm model, and Wiesner (1970) has presented a similar model for the precipitation arising from orographic lifting of moist air over hills or mountains. When orographic and convective effects occur simultaneously, the two types of models can be superimposed. The use of storm models is more successful in determining PMP over large areas than over small ones. The principle of continuity is more easily applied 472 APPLIED HYDROLOGY using mean velocities of inflow and outflow, and the moisture content of the inflowing air can be defined from the dew-point temperature persisting for a considerable time (usually 12 hours) over a large area. These factors are more difficult to define for extreme precipitation rates that occur locally and over short periods. Therefore, although storm models may indicate the magnitude of the precipitation to be expected, they should be carefully calibrated with data from observed storms in the region of interest before use in design. 2. Maximization of actual storms. The chief deficiency of the storm models is their oversimplified representation of the actual storm. If records of actual storms are available, they may be maximized to obtain the PMP values. This process involves increasing the observed storm precipitation by the ratio of the actual moisture inflow to the storm to the maximum moisture inflow theoretically possible at the site. If there are no adequate records of storms in the project basin, it is possibie to transpose storms from other areas to the project basin for the computation of the PMP if these storms could have occurred in the basin. The procedure of storm transposition involves the selection of adequate storms for transposition, determination of the orientation of the storms critical to the basin, and adjustments for differences, if any, in dew-point temperature, elevation, prevailing wind, and orographic effects. The world’s greatest recorded rainfalls, according to the World Meteoro- logical Organization (1983), are approximation by the equation P=. (14.5.1) where P is the precipitation depth in millimeters and Tq is the duration in hours. The equation was obtained by fitting data from observed extreme rainfalls at many locations for durations ranging from one minute to several months. This equation is an estimate of the precipitation depths that could occur under very extreme circumstances. _3. Generalized PMP charts. The estimates of PMP may be made either for individual basins or for large regions encompassing numerous basins of various sizes. In the latter case, the estimates are referred to as generalized estimates and are usually displayed as isohyetal maps that depict the regional variation of PMP for some specified duration, basin size, and annual or seasonal variation. These maps are commonly known as generalized PMP charts. The most widely used generalized PMP charts in the United States are those contained in U. S. National Weather Service hydrometeorological report no. 51, commonly known as HMR 51 (Schreiner and Riedel, 1978), for the United States east of the 105th meridian. These maps specify the probable maximum precipitation depth for any time of the year (referred to as an all-season estimate) as a function of storm area ranging from 10 to 20,000 mi? and storm duration ranging from 6 to 72 hours. For regions west of the 105th meridian, the National Academy of Sciences (1983) has prepared the diagram shown in Fig. 14.5.1, which specifies the appropriate National Weather Service publication from which probable maximum precipitation data may be obtained.

(Source: National Academy of Sciences, 1983. Used with permission.) The Probable Maximum Storm The PMS, or probable maximum storm, involves the temporal distribution of rainfall. The PMS values are generally given as maximum accumulated depths for any specified duration. For example, given depths for 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours typically represent the total depth for each duration and not the time sequence in which the precipitation occurs. In order to develop the hyetograph of a PMS, one needs to know the spatial and temporal distribution of the PMP. One procedure to determine the PMS has been outlined in hydrometeorological report no. 52 (HMR 52) by Hansen, 474 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Schreiner, and Miller (1982) for areas of the United States east of the 105th meridian. For the purpose of modeling maximum runoff, different critical time sequences of PMP increments should be investigated. In general, the critical time distribution of PMP increments is determined by judgment from experience and available information, such as from weather maps of critical historical storms. A commonly adopted sequence is the most advanced time distribution, that is, beginning with the highest amount and continuing with decreasing increments. The Probable Maximum Flood The PMF is the greatest flood to be expected assuming complete coincidence of all factors that would produce the heaviest rainfall and maximum runoff. This is derived from a PMP, and hence its frequency cannot be determined. From the economic viewpoint, it is usually prohibitive to design a structure for PMF, except for large spillways whose failure could lead to excessive damage and loss of life. Hence, a pragmatic approach for many design situations is not to define the design flood as an estimated limiting value, but to scale it downwards by a certain percentage depending on the type of structure and the hazard if it fails. For this purpose, the flood event actually used in design is often the greatest flood that may reasonably be expected, taking into account all pertinent conditions of location, meteorology, hydrology, and topography. This design flood may be determined analytically as the flood caused by a transposed historical largest storm and its magnitude may be a fraction of the ELV. In practice, the design flood is commonly called the standard project flood (SPF). The SPF is estimated using rainfall-runoff modeling by applying the unit- hydrograph method to the standard project storm (SPS), which is the greatest storm that may be reasonably expected. The SPS can be derived from a detailed analysis of storm patterns and transposition of storms to a position that would give maximum runoff. For a particular drainage area and season of year in which snow melt is not a major concern, the SPS estimate should represent the most severe flood-producing depth-area-duration relationship and isohyetal pattern of any storm that is considered reasonably characteristic of the region. The watershed runoff characteristics and any water-control structures in the basin should be considered. When melting snow may constitute a substantial volume of runoff to the SPF hydrograph, appropriate allowances for snow melt should be included in the estimate. Where floods are predominantly the result of melting snow, the SPF estimate should be based on the most critical combinations of snow, temperature, and water losses considered reasonably characteristic. Past estimates have indicated that SPS magnitudes and SPF discharges are generally in the range of 40 to 60 percent of the ELV for the same basins. In some cases the SPF estimate may have a major bearing on the design of a particular project; in other cases the estimate may serve only as an indication of the partial degree of protection proposed for the project. SPF estimates are usually DESIGN STORMS 475 made only for major and intermediate structures since they require considerable effort in preparation. Computer Programs for PMS and PMF Development The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center (1984) describes a computer program called HMR 52 which computes the basin-average precipitation for the probable maximum storm in accordance with the criteria in hydrometeorological report No. 52. Input to this program includes the PMP esti- mates from HMR 51; the program computes the spatially averaged PMP for any of the subbasins or combinations of subbasins in the drainage basin. The program selects the storm area size and orientation so as to produce the maximum basin- average precipitation. Storm centering and time distribution must be provided by the user.

{"paragraph": "14.6 CALCULATION OF PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION Estimates of the runoff from the PMP are required in the design of spillways and in dam safety studies. In order to carry out a rainfall-runoff analysis using the PMP both temporal and spatial distribution of the PMP estimates is required. A stepwise procedure to derive the distribution of the PMP for the United States east of the 105th meridian has been developed by Hansen, Schreiner, and Miller (1982) in hydrometeorological report No. 52. This procedure is used for the determination of the probable maximum storm, which is required to determine peak discharge and to develop the probable maximum flood hydrograph through a rainfall-runoff analysis. The procedure is based upon information derived from major storms of record and is applicable to nonorographic regions of the eastern United States. The procedure for determining the probable maximum precipitation over a watershed has five important elements: (1) depth-area-duration curves, which specify the PMP for a specified storm area and duration; (2) a standard isohyetal pattern distributing the precipitation spatially in the form of an ellipse; (3) an orientation adjustment factor, which reduces the PMP estimates if the standard isohyetal pattern’s longitudinal axis is not oriented in the direction of normal atmospheric moisture flow in the region; (4) a critical storm area, which generates the largest PMP over the watershed; and (5) an isohyetal adjustment factor, which specifies the percentage of the PMP depth that applies on each contour of the standard isohyetal pattern. Depth-area-duration curves. In probability-based point precipitation estimates, there are three variables to be considered: intensity (or depth), duration, and frequency of occurrence. For the PMP, the frequency of occurrence is replaced by storm area as the third variable.

For example, for Chicago, Fig. 14.6.1(a) indicates a PMP for 6 hours of approximately 26 in, and Fig. 14.6.1(b), gives the PMP for 12 hours as approximately 30 in. In a 12- hour probable maximum storm over a 10-mi? area at Chicago, then, 26 in would occur in the most intense 6 hours and 30 — 26 = 4 in of precipitation would occur in the remaining 6 hours.

The orientation of the isohyetal pattern most likely to be conducive to a PMP event for any place in the United States east of the 105th meridian is indicated in Fig. 14.6.3.

Isohyetal area factor. The value of the PMP represents the average precipitation depth over a specified area for a given duration. When a storm is represented by the standard isohyetal pattern, there will be regions of greater precipitation depth near the center of the pattern and of lesser depth near the edges. Figure 14.6.5 shows, for the most intense 6-hour storm interval, the percent of the specified PMP depth to be applied to each contour of the standard isohyetal pattern to get the correct spatial distribution. For example, using the PMP for an area of 10 mi*, according to the graph, contour A (area 10 mi2) gets 100 percent of the PMP depth, and contour B (area 25 mi’) gets 64 percent. So, since the 6-hour PMP depth for 10 mi? at Chicago is 26 in, as found earlier, this storm would have depth 26 x 0.64 = 16.4 in over 25 mi*, which represents a volume of 25 mi? X 16.4 in = 416 mi?-in of precipitation, of which 10 mi? x 26 in = 260 mi?-in, or 63 percent, occurs in the most intense 10-mi? area. 0000 4 {= 4 oe +4 Duration (hr) ai le rp 20000 6B 12 A ] 24 U 4 N 8 7 S 2 | 10000'5 == (Amrie2a) |a= e a a+ , p \"a3 .383 ae 30a 40 +— + 30 20 | 10 + 0 5 10 15 20 PMP (in) FIGURE 14.6.6 ‘ ' .

Develop the depth-area-duration curve. The 6-hour PMP depth at Leon River is read for various storm areas from the standard PMP maps, including those shown in Fig. 14.6.1. PMP depth is plotted as a function of storm area and duration as shown in Fig. 14.6.6. In this example, only the 6-hour curve will be considered. The plotted points from the maps are connected with a smooth line to form the depth-area curve for this duration. Then the PMP depths for a number of storm areas are read from this curve as shown in column 2 of Table 14.6.1. 2. Adjust for watershed orientation. The standard isohyetal pattern is cen- tered over the Leon River drainage basin as shown in Fig. 14.6.7. The longitudi- nal axis of the watershed runs southeast (134°) to northwest (314°), oblique to the preferred direction at this location, from the southwest (208°). The map shown in Fig. 14.6.4 applies to an orientation range of 135° to 315°, so the preferred orien- tation (208°) is subtracted from the watershed axis direction (314°) falling in the range 135° to 315°, i.e. 314° — 208°= 106°. When the orientation difference is greater than 90°, the value of 180° minus the orientation difference is used in read- ing this figure, that is, in this case 180° — 106°= 74°.

For example, for a 1500 mi? area, the graph gives an adjustment factor of 162 percent, or 1.62, for isohyet A. The adjustment factors for all isohyets for a 1500-mi? storm area are shown in column 2 of Table 14.6.2. The adjusted PMP depth for 1500- mi” storm area is 13.44 in from Table 14.6.1, and this value is multiplied by the isohyetal adjustment factor to give the precipitation depth for each isohyet in column 3 of Table 14.6.2; for example, on isohyet A, the depth is 1.62 X 13.44 = 21.77 in. The average precipitation depth P,, between adjacent isohyets is shown in column 4. For isohyet B, Pay = (21.77 + 20.43)/2 = 21.10 in, for example. The incremental areas AA added by including each successive isohyet are shown in column 5 of Table 14.6.2. As shown in Fig. 14.6.7, isohyets A through H are completely contained within the watershed, so the incremental area assigned to them is simply the increase in area from the previous isohyet, with the isohyetal areas being shown on Fig. 14.6.2. For example, isohyet B encompasses 25 mi?, of which 10 mi? falls within isohyet A, so the incremental area for isohyet B is 25 — 10 = 15 mi’. For isohyets I through N, the incremental area in column 5 is that part of the isohyetal area that is also contained within the watershed. The incremental volume AV added for each additional isohyet is calculated as DESIGN STORMS 487 AV= P,,AA. For example, the volume within isohyet A is 21.77 in X 10 mi2=217.7 in-mi?, while isohyet B includes an additional 21.10 in X 15 mi2 = 316.5 in-mi2 as shown in column 6 of the table. By summing the incremental volumes for all isohyets containing at least part of their area within the watershed, the total volume is found, and it is divided by the watershed area to give the average precipitation depth. In this case, the average depth is 31,489.5 in-mi2/3660 mi? = 8.61 in. The procedure described above is repeated for all the storm areas in Table 14.6.1 to find the critical storm area: that area which yields the greatest average PMP over the watershed. In this case the 1500-mi? area gives the largest average depth and is the critical storm area. So the isohyetal precipitation pattern of the 6- hour PMP at Leon River is given by column 3 of Table 14.6.2, and the watershed average 6-hour PMP is 8.61 in. This procedure can be repeated for various durations and the corresponding isohyetal and average depths obtained. A storm hyetograph can be developed from these depths by the alternating block method (Sec. 14.4) or other methods. If a percentage of the probable maximum precipitation is required for a design (e.g., 50 percent, as shown in Table 13.1.1 for some dam designs), the values of the isohyet precipitation depths in column 3 of Table 14.6.2 are reduced to the desired percentage of the values shown.

If the orientation difference is greater than 90°, the value of 180° minus the orientation difference is used in reading the adjustment factor figure. This adjustment factor reduces the PMP estimates if the standard isohyetal pattern's longitudinal axis is not oriented in the direction of normal atmospheric moisture flow."}, {"question": "In the context of PMP estimation, what is the critical storm area, and how is it determined?", "answer": "The critical storm area is the area that generates the largest PMP over the watershed, taking into account the fact that the watershed area is not shaped elliptically like the standard isohyetal pattern. The critical storm area is determined by finding the storm area that yields the greatest average PMP over the watershed, considering the isohyetal adjustment factors and the watershed's orientation."}, {"question": "How do isohyetal adjustment factors affect the spatial distribution of precipitation in PMP estimation?", "answer": "Isohyetal adjustment factors specify the percentage of the PMP depth that applies to each contour of the standard isohyetal pattern.

This adjustment ensures that the PMP estimation accurately represents the potential precipitation distribution over the watershed."}, {"question": "How do depth-area-duration curves relate to the concept of probable maximum precipitation?", "answer": "Depth-area-duration curves are a fundamental component of PMP estimation, as they provide the relationship between storm area, duration, and precipitation depth.

However, the standard isohyetal pattern provides a simplified and consistent approach to PMP estimation, allowing for the development of depth-area-duration curves and the determination of critical storm areas."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to adjust the PMP estimates for orientation differences in the context of PMP estimation?", "answer": "Adjusting the PMP estimates for orientation differences is necessary because the longitudinal axis of the storm pattern may not be aligned with the direction of normal atmospheric moisture flow in the region.

A flood is any high flow that overtops either natural or artificial embankments along a stream. The magnitudes of floods are described by flood discharge, flood elevation, and flood volume. Each of these factors is important in. the hydrologic design of different types of flow control structures. A major portion of this chapter deals with development of the design flow or design flood for flow regulation structures (detention basins, flood control reservoirs, etc.) and flow conveyance structures (storm sewers, drainage channels, flood levees, diversion structures, etc.). The purpose of flow regulation structures is to smooth out peak discharges, thereby decreasing downstream flood elevation peaks, and the purpose of flow conveyance structures is to safely convey the flow to downstream points where the adverse effects of flows are controlled or are minimal. This chapter discusses methods and simulation models that can be used in the hydrologic design of flow control structures from urban drainage systems to flood control reservoirs. Hydrologic design for water use is concerned with the development of water resources to meet human needs and with the conservation of the natural life in water environments. As population and economic activity increase, so do the demands for use of water. But these must be balanced against the finite supply provided by nature and the desire to maintain healthy plant and animal life in rivers, lakes, and estuaries.

{"paragraph": "15.1 STORM SEWER DESIGN Population growth and urban development can create potentially severe problems in urban water management. One of the most important facilities in preserving and improving the urban water environment is an adequate and properly function- ing storm water drainage system. Construction of houses, commercial buildings, parking lots, paved roads, and streets increases the impervious cover in a water- shed, and reduces infiltration. Also, with urbanization, the spatial pattern of flow in the watershed is altered and there is an increase in the hydraulic efficiency of flow through artificial channels, curbing, gutters, and storm drainage and col- lection systems. These factors increase the volume and velocity of runoff and produce larger peak flood discharges from urbanized watersheds than occurred in the preurbanized condition. Many urban drainage systems constructed under one level of urbanization are now operating under a higher level of urbanization and have inadequate capacity. One view of the typical urban drainage system is shown in Fig. 15.1.1. The system can be considered as consisting of two major types of elements: location elements and transfer elements. Location elements are the places where the water TE \\h\\\\ R ainfall Wy \\ it!

DESIGN FLows 495 Stops and undergoes changes as a result of humanly controlled processes, for example, water storage, water treatment, water use, and wastewater treatment. Transfer elements connect the location elements; these elements include channels, pipelines, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and streets. The system is fed by rainfall, influent water from various sources, and imported water in the pipes or channels. The receiving water body can be a river, a lake, or an ocean. Figure 15.1.1 shows a storm sewer system for collection of storm drainage in a pipe network and discharge to a receiving water body. This section considers the design of a sewer system for storm drainage. System concepts are increasingly being used as an aid in understanding and developing solutions to complex urban problems. These problems involve distributed systems, and must be analyzed to account for both spatial and temporal variations. Urban watersheds vary in space in that the ground surface slope and cover, and the soil type, change from place to place in the watershed. They vary in time in that hydrologic characteristics change with the process of urbanization. The mathematical formulation of models for urban water systems distributed in both time and space is a complicated task. Consequently, spatial variation is sometimes ignored, and the system is treated as being lumped. Some spatial variation can be introduced by dividing the watershed system into several subsystems that are each considered lumped, and then linking these lumped- system models together to produce a model of the entire system. Models can be used as tools for planning and management. In particular, a number of computerized watershed simulation models have been proposed. The determination of the runoff volume and peak discharge rate are important issues in urban stormwater management, and methods for calculating these variables range from the well-known rational formula to advanced computer simulation models such as the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM; see Huber, et al., 1975). Design Philosophy A storm sewer system is a network of pipes used to convey storm runoff in a city. The design of storm sewer systems involves the determination of diameters, slopes, and crown or invert elevations for each pipe in the system. The crown and invert elevations of a pipe are, respectively, the elevations of the top and the bottom of the pipe circumference. The selection of a /ayout, or network of pipe locations, for a storm sewer system requires a considerable amount of subjective judgment. Hydrologists are usually able to investigate only a few of the possible layouts. Generally, manholes are placed at street intersections and at major changes in grade, or ground surface slope, and the sewers are sloped in the direction of the ground surface, so as to connect with downstream submains and trunk sewers. Once a layout has been selected, the rational method can be used to select pipe diameters. This conventional design approach is based on a set of design standards and criteria, such as those set forth by the American Society of Civil Engineers (1960) and various planning agencies. 496 APPLIED HYDROLOGY Storm drainage design can be divided into two aspects: runoff prediction and system design. In recent years, rainfall-runoff modeling for urban watersheds has been a popular activity and a variety of such rainfall-runoff models are now available, as described by Chow and Yen (1977), Heeps and Mein (1974), Brandstetter (1976), McPherson (1975), Colyer and Pethick (1977), Yen (1978), and Kibler (1982). Computer models are described more fully in Sec. 15.2. The following constraints and assumptions are commonly used in storm sewer design practice: 1. Free-surface flow exists for the design discharges; that is, the sewer system is designed for “gravity flow”; pumping stations and pressurized sewers are not considered. 2. The sewers are of commercially available circular sizes no smaller than 8 inches in diameter. 3. The design diameter is the smallest commercially available pipe having flow capacity equal to or greater than the design discharge and satisfying all the appropriate constraints. 4. Storm sewers must be placed at a depth such that they will not be susceptible to frost, will be able to drain basements, and will have sufficient cushioning to prevent breakage due to ground surface loading. To these ends, minimum cover depths must be specified. 5. The sewers are joined at junctions such that the crown elevation of the upstream sewer is no lower than that of the downstream sewer. 6. To prevent or reduce excessive deposition of solid material in the sewers, a minimum permissible flow velocity at design discharge or at barely full-pipe gravity flow is specified (e.g., 2.5 ft/s). 7. To prevent scour and other undesirable effects of high-velocity flow, a maxi- mum permissible flow velocity is also specified. 8. At any junction or manhole the downstream sewer cannot be smaller than any of the upstream sewers at that junction. 9. The sewer system is a dendritic, or branching, network converging in the downstream direction without closed loops. Rational Method The rational method, which can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century, is still probably the most widely used method for design of storm sewers (Pilgrim, 1986; Linsley, 1986). Although valid criticisms have been raised about the adequacy of this method, it continues to be used for sewer design because of its simplicity. Once the layout is selected and the pipe sizes determined by the rational method, the adequacy of the system can be checked by dynamic routing of flow hydrographs through the system. The idea behind the rational method is that if a rainfall of intensity i begins instantaneously and continues indefinitely, the rate of runoff will increase until DESIGN FLOws 497 the time of concentration t,, when all of the watershed is contributing to flow at the outlet. The product of rainfall intensity i and watershed area A is the inflow rate for the system, iA, and the ratio of this rate to the rate of peak discharge Q (which occurs at time f,) is termed the runoff coefficient C (0 = C = 1). This is expressed in the rational formula: Q=CiA (15.1.1) Commonly, Q is in cubic feet per second (cfs), i is in inches per hour, and A is in acres, and the conversion (1 cfs = 1.008 acre-in/hr) is considered to be included in the runoff coefficient. The duration used for the determination of the design precipitation intensity i in (15.1.1) is the time of concentration of the watershed. In urban areas, the drainage area usually consists of subareas or subcatch- ments of different surface characteristics. As a result, a composite analysis is required that must account for the various surface characteristics. The areas of the subcatchments are denoted by A; and the runoff coefficients of each subcatch- ment are denoted by C;. The peak runoff is then computed using the following form of the rational formula: => CA; (15.1.2) j= where m is the number of subcatchments drained by a sewer. The assumptions associated with the rational method are: 1. The computed peak rate of runoff at the outlet point is a function of the average rainfall rate during the time of concentration, that is, the peak discharge does not result from a more intense storm of shorter duration, during which only a°* portion of the watershed is contributing to runoff at the outlet. 2. The time of concentration employed is the time for the runoff to become established and flow from the most remote part of the drainage area to the inflow point of the sewer being designed. 3. Rainfall intensity is constant throughout the storm duration. Runoff Coefficient The runoff coefficient C is the least precise variable of the rational method. Its use in the formula implies a fixed ratio of peak runoff rate to rainfall rate for the drainage basin, which in reality is not the case. Proper selection of the runoff coefficient requires judgment and experience on the part of the hydrologist. The proportion of the total rainfall that will reach the storm drains depends on the percent imperviousness, slope, and ponding character of the surface. Impervious surfaces, such as asphalt pavements and roofs of buildings, will produce nearly 100 percent runoff after the surface has become thoroughly wet, regardless of the slope. Field inspection and aerial photographs are useful in estimating the nature of the surface within the drainage area. 498 APPLIED HYDROLOGY The runoff coefficient is also dependent on the character and condition of the soil. The infiltration rate decreases as rainfall continues, and is also influenced by the antecedent moisture condition of the soil. Other factors influencing the runoff coefficient are rainfall intensity, proximity of the water table, degree of soil compaction, porosity of the subsoil, vegetation, ground slope, and depression storage. A reasonable coefficient must be chosen to represent the integrated effects of all these factors. Suggested coefficients for various surface types as used in Austin, Texas are given in Table 15.1.1.

The intensity is selected on the basis of the design rainfall duration and return period as described in Sec. 14.2. The design duration is equal to the time of concentration for the drainage area under consideration. The return period is established by design standards or chosen by the hydrologist as a design parameter. Runoff is assumed to reach a peak at the time of concetration ¢, when the entire watershed is contributing to flow at the outlet. The time of concentration is the time for a drop of water to flow from the remotest point in the watershed to the point of interest. A trial and error procedure can be used to determine the critical time of concentration where there are several possible flow paths to consider. The time of concentration to any point in a storm drainage system is the sum of the inlet time f, (the time it takes for flow from the remotest point to reach the sewer inlet), and the flow time ty in the upstream sewers connected to the outer point: beat outa ty (15.1.3) The flow time is given by Eq. (5.7.3): n L; iy = »y - (15.1.4) ie where L; is the length of the ith pipe along the flow path, and V; is the flow velocity in the pipe. The inlet time, or time of concentration for the case of no upstream sewers, can be obtained by experimental observations, or it can be estimated by using formulas such as those listed in Table 15.1.2. There may exist several possible flow routes for different catchments drained by a sewer; the longest time of concentration among the times for different routes is assumed to be the critical time of concentration of the area drained. Because the areas contributing to most storm sewer inlets are relatively small, it is also customary to determine the inlet time on the basis of experience under similar conditions. Inlet time decreases as the slope and imperviousness of the surface increases, and it increases as the distance over which the water has to travel increases and as retention by the contact surfaces increases. All inlet times determined on the basis of experience should be verified by direct overland flow computation. Drainage Area The size and shape of the catchment or subcatchment under consideration must be determined. The area may be determined by planimetering topographic maps, or by field surveys where topographic data has changed or where the mapped contour interval is too great to distinguish the direction of flow.

The outline of the drainage divide must follow the actual watershed boundary, rather than commercial land boundaries, as may be used in the design of sanitary sewers. The drainage divide lines are influenced by pavement slopes, locations of downspouts and paved and unpaved yards, grading of lawns, and many other features introduced by urbanization. Pipe Capacity In choosing storm sewer pipe diameters, the mimimum required diameter is com- puted, and the next larger commercially available size is selected. Commercial pipes are available in diameters of 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, and 18 in, at increments of 3 in between 18 and 36 in, and at increments of 6 in between 3 ft and 10 ft. Once the design discharge Q entering the sewer pipe has been calculated by the rational formula, the diameter of pipe D required to carry this discharge is determined. It is usually assumed that the pipe is flowing full under gravity but is not pressurized, so the pipe capacity can be calculated by the Manning or Darcy-Weisbach equations for open-channel flow. For Manning’s equation, the area is A = 7D2/4, and the hydraulic radius is R = A/P = (mD7/4)/mD = D/4. The friction slope S+ is set equal to the bed slope of the pipe, So, thus assuming uniform flow, and the discharge is computed for full pipe flow as _ 1.49 Q S) \"ARs n _ 1.49 <yp/aD?\\/D te Hea N24 4 0.463 = = Sy°D*? @5:1.5) This is solved for the required diameter D as 2.160 3/8 .16Qn D= (15.1.6) which is valid for Q in cubic feet per second, and D in feet. When using SI units, with Q in cubic meters per second and’D in meters, the coefficient 2.16 is replaced by 2.16 X 1.49 = 3.21 in Eq.(15.1.6).

Equation (15.1.8) is valid for any dimensionally consistent set of units. Assessment of the Rational Method The rational method is criticized by some hydrologists because of its simplified approach to the calculation of design flow rates. Nevertheless, the rational method is still widely used for the design of storm sewer systems in the United States and other countries because of its simplicity and the fact that the required dimensions of the storm sewers are determined as the computation proceeds. More realistic flow simulation procedures involving the routing of flow hydrographs require the dimensions of the flow conveyance structures to be predetermined. The storm sewer system design produced by the rational method can be considered as a preliminary design whose adequacy can be checked by routing flow hydrographs through the system. The uncertainties involved in the rational method can be examined by the risk analysis procedures described in Chap. 13 (Yen, 1975; Yen, et al., 1976; Yen, 1978). In this case, the loading on the system is described by the rational formula (15.1.2) and the capacity by the pipe conveyance equations (15.1.5) or (15.1.7). Problems 15.1.8 to 15.1.16 address this subject. is shown in Fig. 15.1.2. Determine the required capacity of the storm sewer EB draining subarea III for a five-year return period storm.

The ground elevations at points E and B are 498.43 and 495.55 ft above mean sea level, respectively, and the length of pipe EB is 450 ft. Assume Manning’s n is 0.015. Calculate the flow time in the pipe. Solution. The time of concentration for flow into sewer EB is simply the 10-minute inlet time for flow from subcatchment III to point E. So, Tz= 10 min and the design rainfall intensity with T = 5 years js a 1207°:175 (Ta + 27) a 120(5)°-!75 (10 + 27) = 4,30 in/h The design discharge is given by Eq. (15.1.1):. Q=CiA =0.6 X 4.30 x 4 = 10.3 cfs The slope of the pipe EB. is the difference between the ground elevations at points E and B divided by the length of the pipe: So = (498.43 — 495.55)/450 = 0.0064.

The flow velocity through pipe EB is found by taking the nominal diameter (1.75 ft), and assuming the pipe is flowing full with Q = 10.3 cfs. Hence, V= Q/A = 10.3/(mX 1.757/4) = 4.28 ft/s. The flow time is L/V= 450/4.28 = 105 5 = 1.75 min. It should be noted that a slight error in the computed flow time is caused by assuming that the pipe is flowing full. The velocity for partially-full-pipe flow can be determined using Newton’s iteration technique presented in Chap. 5, if necessary. acre drainage basin shown in Fig. 15.1.2. The area, runoff coefficients, and inlet time for each subcatchment are shown in Table 15.1.3, and the length and slope for ‘each pipe are in columns 2 and 3 of Table 15.1.4. Use the same rainfall intensity equation as in Example 15.1.1 and assume the pipes have Manning’s n = 0.015. DESIGN FLOws 505 Solution. The same method as was illustrated in Example 15.1.1 is used for each pipe, except that now the time of concentration must include both inlet time and flow time through upstream sewers. The results obtained in Example 15.1.1 for pipe EB are shown in the first row of Table 15.1.4. Pipe AB. This pipe drains subcatchments I and II. From Table 15.1.3, A;= 2 acres, C; = 0.7, and the inlet time is t) = 5 min, while Ay = 3 acres, Cy = 0.7, and t; = 7 min. Hence, the total area drained by pipe AB is 5 acres and CA = C\\A; + CnAn = 0.7 X 2 + 0.7 X 3 = 3.5. The time of concentration used is 7 min, the larger of the two inlet times. The calculations for the required diameter are carried out in the same way as in Example 15.1.1; the results are shown in the second row of Table 15.1.4. The calculated diameter, 1.94 ft, is rounded up to a commercial size of 2.0 ft (24 in) for pipe AB. Pipe BC. This pipe drains subcatchments I through V: subcatchments J and II through pipe AB, subcatchment III through pipe EB, and subcatchments [V and V directly. There. are thus four possible flow paths for water to reach point B; the time of concentration is the largest of their flow times. The flow time for flow coming from pipe AB is 7 minutes inlet time plus 1.76 minutes travel time, or 8.76 minutes; for the flow from pipe EB it is 10 minutes inlet time plus 1.75 minutes flow time, or 11.75 minutes; and the inlet times for subcatchments IV and V are 10 min and 15 min, respectively. Thus, the time of concentration for pipe BC is taken as 15 min. For subcatchments I and II, 2 CA = 3.5, as shown previously. For subcatch- ments III to V, the values of the runoff coefficient and catchment area are given in 0.5 x 5 = 10.8. Proceeding as in Example 15.1.1, the calculated pipe diameter is 2.87 ft, which is rounded up to 3.0 ft (36 in) for pipe BC (third row of Table 15.1.4). Pipe CD. This pipe drains all seven subcatchments. Using the same method as for the previous pipes, its time of concentration (to point C) is found to be 15 minutes (to point B) plus 1.2 minutes flow time in pipe BC, or 16.2 minutes, and CA = 15.3. The calculated diameter, 3.22 ft, is rounded up to a commercial size of 3.50 ft (42 in) (fourth row of Table 15.1.4). The required diameters for pipes AB, BC, and CD are 21, 36, and 42 in, respectively.

{"paragraph": "15.2 SIMULATING DESIGN FLOWS Since the early 1960s, a host of deterministic hydrologic simulation models have. been developed. These models include event simulation models for modeling a single rainfall-runoff event and continuous simulation models, which have soil moisture accounting procedures to simulate runoff from rainfall in hourly or daily intervals over long time periods. Examples of event simulation models include: the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1981) HEC-1 flood hydrograph model; the Soil Conservation Service (1965) TR-20 computer program for project hydrology; the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (1977) SWMM storm water management model; and the Illinois State Water Survey ILLUDAS model, by Terstriep and Stall (1974). Examples of continuous simulation models include: the U. S. National Weather Service runoff forecast system (Day, 1985); the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1976) STORM model; and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1972) SSARR streamflow synthesis and reservoir regulation model. This is by no means a complete list of available models, but it covers most of the models commonly used in hydrologic practice. The HEC-1 model is probably the most widely used hydrologic event simulation model. The acronym HEC stands for Hydrologic Engineering Center, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers research facility in Davis, California, where this model was developed. HEC-1 Model HEC-1 is designed to simulate the surface runoff resulting from precipitation by representing the basin as an interconnected system of components. Each component models an aspect of the rainfall-runoff process within a subbasin or subarea; components include subarea surface runoff, stream channels, and reservoirs. Each component is represented by a set of parameters that specifies the particular characteristics of the component and the mathematical relations describing its physical processes. The end result of the modeling process is the computation of direct runoff hydrographs for various subareas and streamflow hydrographs at desired locations in the watershed. A subarea land surface runoff component is used to represent the movement of water over the land surface and into stream channels. The input to this com- ponent is a rainfall hyetograph. Excess rainfall is computed by subtracting infil- tration and detention losses, based on an infiltration function that may be chosen from several options, including the SCS curve number loss rate as presented in Sec. 5.5. Rainfall and infiltration are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the subbasin. The resulting rainfall excesses are then applied to the unit hydro- graph to derive the subarea outlet runoff hydrograph. Unit hydrograph options include the Snyder’s unit hydrograph and the SCS dimensionless unit hydrograph presented in Chap. 7. Alternatively, a kinematic wave model can be used to find subbasin runoff hydrographs. A stream routing component is used to represent flood wave movement in a channel. The input to this component is an upstream hydrograph resulting from individual or combined contributions of subarea runoff, streamflow 508 appLizD HYDROLOGY routings, or diversions. This hydrograph is routed to a downstream point, using the characteristics of the channel. The techniques available to route the runoff hydrograph include the Muskingum method, level-pool routing, and the kinematic wave method. A suitable combination of subarea runoff and streamflow routing compo- nents can be used to represent a rainfall-runoff and stream routing problem. The connectivity of the stream network components is implied by the order in which the input data components are arranged. Simulation must always begin at the uppermost subarea in a branch of the stream network, and proceed downstream until a confluence is reached. Before simulating below the confluence, all flows above it must be routed. The flows are combined at the confluence, and the combined flow is routed downstream. Use of a reservoir component is similar to that of a streamflow routing component. A reservoir component represents the storage-outflow characteristics of a reservoir or flood-retarding structure. The reservoir component functions by receiving upstream inflows and routing them through a reservoir using storage routing methods. The reservoir outflow is solely a function of storage (or water surface elevation) in the reservoir and is not dependent on downstream controls. Spillway characteristics are entered along with top-of-dam characteristics for overtopping. A simplified dam-break option is also available. HEC-! computer program is to be developed for the Castro Valley Creek catchment, shown in Fig. 15.2.1 in order to analyze the effects of urbanization. The catchment FIGURE 15.2.1 The Castro Valley watershed (Example 15.2.1). Outlet (Source: Ford, 1986.) DESIGN FLOws 509 is divided into four subcatchments; a schematic diagram of the watershed is shown in Fig. 15.2.2. Subcatchment 4 is undergoing urbanization through development of a new residential area, and a detention reservoir in subcatchment 4 and downstream channel modifications are being investigated, the purpose of which is to reduce the effects of the additional flow resulting from the development. The objective of the problem is to calculate the runoff hydrograph at the catchment outlet for three dif- ferent conditons: (1) the existing condition throughout the catchment, (2) the existing condition in subcatchments 1 to 3 with subcatchment 4 urbanized, and (3) the same as (2) but with a modified channel and a reservoir in subcatchment 4. Subarea runoff computations are performed using Snyder’s synthetic unit hydrograph with rainfall loss rates determined using the SCS curve number method, channel routing is carried out by the Muskingum method, and routing through the reservoir by the level-pool method. The following Table presents the existing characteristics of the subcatch- ments. The total watershed area is 5.51 mi?.

The flood wave travel time (Muskingum coefficient K) for the stream reach passing through subarea 3 is estimated as 0.3 h, and the travel time for subarea 1 is estimated as 0.6 h. The Muskingum X has been approximated as 0.2 for each of the two stream reaches. The design rainfall is a hypothetical 100-year-return-period storm defined by the following depth-duration data.

Next, rainfall-runoff computations are performed for sub- catchment 2, and this runoff is routed through subcatchment 3 and added to the outlet hydrograph. The final step is to perform the rainfall-runoff computations for subcatchment 3 and to add this result to the outlet hydrograph. The resulting runoff hydrographs at the outlet of subcatchment 4 and at the outlet of the entire catchment for each of the three plans are shown in Fig. 15.2.3. The peak discharge from subcatchment 4 under existing conditions is 271 cfs, and under urbanized conditions, 909 cfs. The detention reservoir reduces the peak dis- charge to 482 cfs. The peak water surface elevation in the reservoir is 402.88 ft above mean sea level (MSL) at time 12.67 h. The peak discharges at the outlet are 1906 cfs for existing conditions, 2258 cfs for urbanized conditions, and 2105 cfs for urbanized conditions with the reservoir and channel modifications.

The models applicable to design of storm sewer systems can be classified as design models, flow prediction models, and planning models. Design models. These models determine the sizes and other geometric dimen- sions of storm sewers (and of other facilities) for a new system or an extension or improvement to an existing system. The design computations are usually carried out for a specified design return period. Design models may be classified further into hydraulic design models and least-cost optimal design models. Hydraulic design models range from the simple rational method to much more sophisticated flow simulation models based upon solving the dynamic wave equations. One example of a hydraulic design model is ILLUDAS (Illinois Urban Drainage Area Simulator), developed by Terstriep and Stall (1974), which is popular both in the United States and abroad. This model is an extension of the British TRRL (Transportation and Road Research Laboratory) model (Watkins, 1962) to include both paved-area and grassed-area hydrographs. A flow chart for the ILLUDAS program is given in Fig. 15.2.4. Least-cost optimal design models are intended for determining the lowest- cost storm sewer layout and pipe diameters that will convey storm drainage adequately. These models are based on optimization techniques such as linear pro- gramming, dynamic programming, nonlinear programming, heuristic techniques, or a combination of these. The flow simulation for the sewer network is con- sidered a part of the optimization. One of the more comprehensive models of this type is a dynamic programming model called ILSD (Illinois Sewer Design) developed by Yen, et al. (1976). Flow prediction models. These models simulate the flow of storm water in existing systems of known geometric sizes or in proposed systems with prede- termined geometric sizes. Most flow prediction models simulate the flow for a single rainfall event, but some can simulate the response to a sequence of events. The simulation might be for historical, real-time, or synthetically-generated storm events. At least some simple hydraulics is considered in most models. A model may or may not include water quality simulation. The purpose of a flow simula- tion may be to check the adequacy and performance of an existing or proposed system for flood mitigation and water pollution control, to provide information for storm water management, or to form part of a real-time operational control system. An emerging design philosophy is to use either traditional (rational method) or more advanced optimization methods for designing a storm sewer system, then checking the final design by detailed hydraulic simulation and cost analysis. An example of this approach is a British design and analysis procedure called the Wallingford Storm Sewer Package (WASSP; see Price, 1981). 516 apPLIED HYDROLOGY Read basic data and design storm Read cards for next reach Compute paved area hydrograph Compute grassed- area supply rate _ Compute the grassed area-hydrograph Combine the paved- and grassed-area hydrographs Combine other hydrographs tributary to this point Design What Evaluation is the mode at this reach ?

These models are used for broader planning studies of urban stormwater problems, usually for a relatively large space frame and over a relatively long period of time. The quantity and quality of storm water is treated in a gross manner, considering only the mass conservation of water and pollutants without considering the dynamics of their motion through the system. Planning models are employed for such tasks as studies of receiving water quality and treatment facilities. They do not require detailed geometric information on the drainage facilities as do the first two groups of models. Typical examples of planning models are: (1) STORM (Storage, Treatment, Overflow, Runoff Model), created by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1976); (2) SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), developed by Metcalf and Eddy, Inc., the University of Florida, and Water Resources Engineers, Inc., (Metcalf and Eddy, 1971; U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1977); (3) RUNQUAL (Runoff Quality), which includes the hydraulic portion of the SWMM RUNOFF model and the stream water quality model QUAL-II (Roesner, Giguere, and Davis, 1977); (4) HSPF (Hydrocomp Simulation Program— Fortran) developed by Johnson, et al. (1980), which is a later version of the Stanford Watershed Model; and (5) MITCAT (MIT catchment model) by Harley, Perkins, and Eagleson (1970). 15.3. FLOOD PLAIN ANALYSIS A flood plain is the normally dry land area adjoining rivers, streams, lakes, bays, or oceans that is inundated during flood events. The most common causes of flooding are the overflow of streams and rivers and abnormally high tides resulting from severe storms. The flood plain can include the full width of narrow stream valleys, or broad areas along streams in wide, flat valleys. As shown in Fig. 15.3.1, the channel and flood plain are both integral parts of the natural conveyance of a stream. The flood plain carries flow in excess of the channel capacity and the greater the discharge, the further the extent of flow over the flood plain. The first step in any flood plain analysis is to collect data, including topographic maps, flood flow data if a gaging station is nearby, rainfall data if flood flow data are not available, and surveyed cross sections and channel roughness estimates at a number of points along the stream. A determination of the flood discharge for the desired return period is required. If gaged flow records are available, a flood flow frequency analysis can be performed. If gaged data are not available, then a rainfall-runoff analysis must be performed to determine the flood discharge. The rainfall hyetograph is determined for the desired return period, a synthetic unit hydrograph is developed for each subarea of the drainage basin, and the direct runoff hydrograph from each subarea is calculated. The subarea direct runoff hydrographs are routed downstream and added to determine the total direct runoff hydrograph at the most downstream part of the drainage basin, as was illustrated in Example 15.2.1 for Castro Valley. The peak discharge of the most downstream hydrograph is used as the design flood discharge. 518 appLigD HYDROLOGY Once the flood discharge for the desired return period has been determined, the next step is to determine the profile of water surface elevation along the channel. This analysis can be carried out assuming steady, gradually-varied, nonuniform flow using a one-dimensional model such as HEC-2 (U. S. Army Corps of Engi:eers, 1982), or a two-dimensional model based upon either finite differences or finite elements (Lee and Bennett, 1981; Lee, et al., 1982; Mays and Taur, 1984). One-dimensional models allow the flow properties to vary along the channel only, while two-dimensional models account for changes across the channel as well. Alternatively, an unsteady flow analysis can be performed to identify the maximum water surface elevation at various cross sections during the propagation of the flood wave through a stream or river reach, using DAMBRK, DWOPER, or FLDWAV, as described in Chap. 10. Unsteady flow models are necessary for flood plain delineation in large lakes because the storage in the lake alters the shape and peak discharge of the flood hydrograph as it passes through.

(Source: Waananen, et al., 1977. Used by permission.) DESIGN FLOws 519 After the water surface elevations have been determined, the area covered by the flood plain is delineated. The lateral extent of the flood plain is determined by finding ground points on both sides of the stream that correspond to the flood profile (water surface) elevations. Ground elevations in the flood plain can be determined from topographic maps, street maps, or stereo aerial photos. Topographic maps are the most convenient, with the elevations given by contour lines. The flood plain boundary is determined by following the contour line that corresponds to the flood profile elevation for a particular area. Of course, the flood plain delineation is only as accurate as the topographic maps used. After flood levels have been determined for a particular reach of stream the actual location of the flood plain boundaries should be checked by field surveys. In order to provide a standard national procedure, the 100-year flood has been adopted by the U. S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the base flood for purposes of flood plain management measures. The 500- year flood is also employed to indicate additional areas of flood risk in the community. For each stream studied in detail, the boundaries of the 100- and 500-year floods are normally delineated using the flood elevations determined at each cross section. Between cross sections, the boundaries are interpolated using topographic maps at a scale of 1:24,000 with a contour interval of 10 feet or 20 feet. In cases where the 100- and 500-year flood boundaries are close together, only the 100-year boundary is shown. Encroachment on flood plains, such as by artificial fill material, reduces the flood-carrying capacity, increases the flood heights of streams, and increases flood hazards in areas beyond the encroachment. One aspect of flood plain management involves balancing the economic gain from flood plain development against the resulting increase in flood hazard. For purposes of FEMA studies, the 100-year flood area is divided into a floodway and a floodway fringe, as shown in Fig. 15.3.2. The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent flood Water surface of selected flood with encroachment in fringe areas Floodway Designated floodway fringe —> | <— —> | | | Allowed increase | Natural water surface of selected flood FIGURE 15.3.2 ‘oe , Definition of floodway and floodway fringe. The floodway fringe is the area between the designated floodway limit and the limit of the selected flood. The floodway limit is defined so that encroachment limited to the floodway fringe will not significantly increase flood elevation. The 100-year flood is commonly used and a one-foot allowable increase is standard in the United States. 520 APPLIED HYDROLOGY plain areas that must be kept free of encroachment in order for the 100-year flood - to be carried without substantial increases in flood heights. FEMA’s minimum standards allow an increase in flood height of 1.0 foot, provided that hazardous velocities are not produced. The floodway fringe is the portion of the flood plain that could be completely obstructed without increasing the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood by more than 1.0 foot at any point. i 8 — \\ x Hosn ta uw e EXPLANATION - =. —1940— _ Boundary of 1940 flood —-—1955-—- Boundary of 1955 flood 9 River mile measured along stream channel upstream from Dutton Landing ce es PRU sie Vaya il MN de @a shown \\ \\. se figure 24 iy eps ete\\ \\ 3 x 38°17'30\" FIGURE 15.3.3 Flood hazard map for Napa, California.

Flood hazard maps such as Fig. 15.3.3 for Napa, California, show the extent of inundation as determined from a thorough technical study of flooding at a given location.

in flood plain information reports."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to update flood hazard maps when changes occur in the channels, flood plains, or upstream areas?", "answer": "It is necessary to update flood hazard maps when changes occur in the channels, flood plains, or upstream areas because these changes can affect the stream discharges, water surface elevation, and flow velocities, thereby changing the elevation profile defining the flood plain, and impacting the accuracy of the flood hazard map."}, {"question": "How do urban storm drainage models, such as ILLUDAS and SWMM, contribute to the design and management of urban stormwater systems?", "answer": "Urban storm drainage models, such as ILLUDAS and SWMM, contribute to the design and management of urban stormwater systems by providing a framework for simulating the flow of storm water in existing or proposed systems, and for evaluating the effectiveness of different design and management strategies, such as the use of detention reservoirs and channel modifications, in reducing the impacts of urbanization on the hydrologic response of a watershed."}]}
{"paragraph": "15.4 FLOOD CONTROL RESERVOIR DESIGN Urbanization increases both the volume and the velocity of runoff, and efforts have been made in urban areas to offset these effects. Storm water detention basins provide one means of managing storm water. A storm water detention basin can range from as simple a structure as the backwater effect behind a highway or road culvert, up to a large reservoir with sophisticated control devices. Detention is the holding of runoff for a short period of time before releasing it to the natural water course. The terms “detention” and “retention” are often misused; retention is the holding of water in a storage facility for a considerable length of time, for aesthetic, agricultural, consumptive, or other uses. The water might never be discharged to a natural watercourse, but instead be consumed by plants, evaporation, or infiltration into the ground. Detention facilities generally do not significantly reduce the total volume of surface runoff, but simply reduce peak flow rates by redistributing the flow hydrograph. However, there are excep- tions: for example, the reduced surface runoff volume from land areas that have been contour-plowed, and the reduced surface runoff from detention basins on granular soils. On-site detention of storm water is storage of runoff on or near the site where precipitation occurs. In some applications, the runoff may first be conducted short distances by collector sewers located on or adjacent to the site of the detention facility. On-site detention is distinguished from downstream detention by its proximity to the upper end of a basin and its use of small detention facilities as opposed to the larger dams normally associated with downstream detention. The concept of detaining runoff and releasing it at a regulated rate is an important principle in storm water management. In areas having appreciable topographic relief, detention storage attenuates peak flow rates and the high kinetic energy of surface runoff. Such flow attenuation can reduce soil erosion and the amounts of contaminants of various kinds that are assimilated and transported by urban runoff from land, pavements, and other surfaces. Several different y 522 APPLIED HYDROLOGY methods exist for the detention of storm water, including underground storage, storage in basins and ponds, parking lot storage, and rooftop detention. There are several considerations involved in the design of storm water detention facilities. These are: (1) the selection of a design rainfall event, (2) the volume of storage needed, (3) the maximum permitted release rate, (4) pollution control requirements and opportunities, and (5) design of the outlet works for releasing the detained water. Flow simulation models such as the HEC-1 model can be used to perform reservoir routing to check the adequacy of detention basin designs. The hypothetical ponded area in Fig. 15.4.1 serves as an example of a detention pond. Figure 15.4.2 provides a comparison of the outflow hydrographs from this detention pond with the corresponding inflow hydrographs for various flow volumes. In all cases, the detention pond reduces the flood peak discharge, but less so when the volume of runoff is large than when it is small. Modified Rational Method The modified rational method is an extension of the rational method for rainfalls lasting longer than the time of concentration. This method was developed so that the concepts of the rational method could be used to develop hydrographs for storage design, rather than just flood peak discharges for storm sewer design. The modified rational method can be used for the preliminary design of detention storage for watersheds of up to 20 or 30 acres. The shape of the hydrograph produced by the modified rational method is a trapezoid, constructed by setting the duration of the rising and recession ponding area embankment culvert height length width 2EFPdHLoiAeRthT~aEa t t) >aFng>leO MusWed in determination of slope FIGURE 15.4.1 Schematic representation of wedge-shaped ponding area with box culvert outlet.

The inflow peaks are all 1000 cfs; however, the inflow volumes vary. The ponding area is a hypothetical wedge-shaped storage area (Fig. 15.4.1), and a 4 ft x 4 ft box culvert serves as the outlet. The pond width is 60 ft with a slope of 0.02 ft/ft. The flow with the largest volume results in the highest outflow rate from the pond. (Source: Craig and Rankl, 1978.

Figure 15.4.3 illustrates modified-rational- method hydrographs developed for a drainage basin that has a 10-minute time of concentration and is subject to rainfall of various durations longer than 10 minutes. For example, consider the tallest trapezoid in the figure. Its rainfall duration is 7, = 20 min, and the corresponding rainfall intensity i is used in the rational formula (15.1.1) to compute the peak discharge. The hydrograph rises linearly to this discharge at the time of concentration (10 minutes), is constant until the rainfall ceases (20 minutes), then recedes linearly to zero discharge at 30 minutes. The hydrographs for longer rainfall durations have lower peak discharges because their rainfall intensities are lower. If an allowable discharge out of a proposed detention basin is known, such as from a requirement that the peak discharge from the detention pond not be greater than the peak discharge. from the area under predeveloped conditions, then the required detention storage for each rainfall duration can be approximated by determining the area of the trapezoidal hydrograph above the allowable discharge. By calculating the storage for hydrographs of rainfalls of various durations, the hydrologist can determine the critical duration for the design storm as the one requiring the greatest detention storage. This critical duration can also be determined analytically. = s s-c it o 2) i—| ° Oo Ptirmoie°p osed D oS gla = 10 minutes Ee ee Q(c fs) FIGURE 15.4.3 Typical storm water runoff hydrographs for the modified 0 10 20 30 40 50 rational method with various Time (min) rainfall durations.

This is particularly important in areas with appreciable topographic relief, where detention storage can play a crucial role in reducing the impact of urbanization on the environment."}]}
{"paragraph": "15.5 FLOOD FORECASTING Flood forecasting is an expanding area of application of hydrologic techniques. The goal is to obtain real-time precipitation and stream flow data through a microwave, radio, or satellite communications network, insert the data into rain- fall-runoff and stream flow routing programs, and forecast flood flow rates and water levels for periods of from a few hours to a few days ahead, depending on the size of the watershed. Flood forecasts are used to provide warnings for people to evacuate areas threatened by floods, and to help water management personnel operate flood control structures, such as gated spillways on reservoirs. The data collection systems used in flood forecasting are described in Chap. 6. The components involved in a flood forecasting model for a large reservoir system can be illustrated by considering a model developed at the University of Texas at Austin for the Highland Lakes reservoir system on the lower Colorado River basin in central Texas (Fig. 15.5.1; see Unver, Mays, and Lansey, 1987).

(Source: Unver, Mays, and Lansey, 1987.) multiple objectives. The portion of the river basin controlled by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) extends from the headwaters of Lake Buchanan downstream to the mouth of the Colorado River at the Gulf of Mexico. The Highland Lakes system consists of seven reservoirs that are serially connected. Urban development in the flood plain of the Highland Lakes has restricted the range within which the reservoirs may be operated during floods. As an example, the original design of Lake Travis in the 1930s called for a release of 90,000 cfs during severe flooding conditions. Subsequent construction in the flood plain downstream of the lake has reduced the safe release (without flooding) to less than 30,000 cfs. Flood control operation of the Highland Lakes is also complicated because only two of the lakes, Buchanan and Travis, can store any significant flood volumes. The other lakes are held at constant level during normal operation. The flood forecasting model for the Highland Lakes system can be used in a real-time framework to make decisions on reservoir operations during flooding.

The overall model structure is shown in Fig. 15.5.2. Real-time data are input to the model from the data collection network. The real-time flood control module includes the following submodules: (1) a DWOPER submodule, that is, the U. S. National Weather Service Dynamic Wave Operational Model for unsteady flow routing; (2) a GATES submodule, which determines gate operation information for DWOPER, such as the gate discharge as a function of the head on the gate; (3) a RAINFALL-RUNOFF submodule which is an SCS-type rainfall-runoff model for the ungaged drainage area surrounding the lakes for which stream flow data is not available; (4) a DISPLAY submodule, which contains graphical display software; and (5) an OPERATIONS submodule which is the user-control software that interactively operates the other submodules and data files. The input for this flood forecasting model includes both the real-time data and the physical description of system components that remain unchanged during a flood. The physical data include: (1) DWOPER data describing stream cross section information, roughness relationships, and so on; (2) characteristics of the reservoir spillway structures for GATES; and (3) drainage area description and hydrologic parameter estimates for RAINFALL-RUNOFF. The entire river-lake system contains 871 cross sections for DWOPER. It is divided into five subsys- tems because running the model for the whole system at once is usually not necessary, since floods tend to be localized within one or two of the subsystems.
