{"paragraph": "1.1 HYDROLOGY The word hydrology combines the Greek and word huddr, which means \"water,\" and the term -logy, which designates \"a study of.\" It also has origins in the New Latin word hydrolo- gia. More specifically, the general word hydrologv refers to the scientific study of water and its properties, distribution, and effects on Earth's surface, soil, and atmosphere. The study of water can mean different things to different professions. To a chemist, a water molecule is a stable chemical bond of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen; the chemist will be interested in the properties of water and its role in chemical reactions. The climatologist will be interested in the effect of the water stored in the soil and lakes on climatic processes. To those involved in the design of hydraulic machinery, the study of the properties of water will concentrate on the forces exerted by water in a dynamic state. To the mechanical engineer, the properties of water in the form of steam can be important. The ground water hydrologist will be interested in the movement of water in transporting pollutants. Even geographers and historians may be interested in water, at least in terms of how its availability and accessibility has shaped development and culture. However, our interest herein is in the narrow field of hydrologic engineering analysis and design. Engineering hydrology encompasses those as- pects of hydrology that relate to the design and operation of engineering projects for the con- trol and use of water. Aspects that relate to our nation's infrastructure are of special interest because of the decay of our infrastructure. Whereas the primary interest will be to the engi- neer, others, such as planners, environmentalists, water managers, and meteorologists, may find the knowledge of hydrologic engineering to be of interest. Earth's atmosphere, oceans, ice masses, lakes, rivers, streams, and soil contain over 50 billion cubic feet of water. In spite of this abundance, problems are created by either too much or too little water at a given location; that is, problems are caused by the spatial varia- tion of water. For example, people living in southern California and other areas of the arid southwest show concern over the lack of an inexpensive source of water supply. Problems also result from variations in the time distribution of water. An overabundance of water at one time or an undersupply at other times can have serious consequences to both agriculture and manufacturing, as well as inconveniencing the public. Occasional flooding is a problem to homeowners and to entire cities. Crops do not grow at the optimum rate when the soil is either too wet or too dry. Manufacturing operations require a consistent water supply over time for a variety of purposes, such as to provide cooling water and to assimilate wastes. Thus although Earth's total volume of water may be adequate to meet all needs, problems are created by variations in both the spatial and temporal distributions of water availability. Ex- treme problems, including life-threatening situations. can result from extreme variations in either the spatial or temporal distribution of water, or both. set. 1.2 The Hydrologic Cycle 3 In an attempt to overcome the problems created by these variations in the temporal and spatial variations in water availability, engineers and hydrologists attempt to make predic- tions of water availability. These predictions are used in the evaluation of alternative means of preventing or solving problems. A number of factors contribute to the ineffectiveness of these engineering designs. First, the occurrence of rainfall cannot be predicted with certainty. That is, it is not possible to predict exactly how much rain will occur in one time period (for example, day, month, year). The uncertainty of extreme variation in rainfall amounts is even greater than the uncertainty in the rainfall volumes occumng in the more frequent storm events. It is difficult to design engineering works that will control the water under all condi- tions of variation in both the time and spatial distribution. Second, even if we had perfect in- formation, the cost of all of the worthwhile projects needed to provide the optimum avail- ability of water is still prohibitive. Therefore, only the most efficient and necessary projects can be constructed. Third, hydrologic processes such as rainfall and runoff are very complex and a complete, unified theory of hydrology does not exist. Therefore, measurements of ob- served occurrences are used to supplement the scant theoretical understanding of hydrologic processes that exists. However, given the limited records of data, the accuracy of many engi- neering designs is less than we would like. These three factors (hydrologic uncertainty, eco- nomic limitations, and lack of theory and observed data) are just some of the reasons that we cannot provide solutions to all problems created by undesirable variations in the spatial and temporal distributions of water. In spite of the inherent uncertainty in precipitation, the economic constraints, and the bounds on our theoretical understanding of hydrometeorological processes, solutions to the problems that are created by the temporal and spatial variations in water availability must be provided. Estimates of hydrologic quantities such as streamflow are required as input to en- gineering designs, which represent the engineer's attempt to solve the problem. All engineer- ing designs should, at the minimum, be rational. An understanding of the physical processes is a necessary prerequisite to the development of rational designs.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrology, what does the term \"hydrology\" refer to?", "answer": "The term \"hydrology\" refers to the scientific study of water and its properties, distribution, and effects on Earth's surface, soil, and atmosphere."}, {"question": "Why are variations in the spatial and temporal distributions of water availability problematic?", "answer": "Variations in the spatial and temporal distributions of water availability are problematic because they can lead to either too much or too little water at a given location, causing issues such as flooding, undersupply of water for agriculture and manufacturing, and inconvenience to the public.

Firstly, the occurrence of rainfall cannot be predicted with certainty, making it difficult to anticipate and prepare for extreme events. Secondly, even with perfect information, the cost of constructing all worthwhile projects to provide optimal water availability is prohibitive, leading to economic constraints.

By taking into account these variations, engineers can develop designs that are more resilient and adaptable to different scenarios, ultimately reducing the risks associated with water-related hazards and improving the overall management of water resources."}, {"question": "How do economic limitations affect the construction of engineering projects for water management?", "answer": "Economic limitations significantly affect the construction of engineering projects for water management, as the cost of building all worthwhile projects to provide optimal water availability is often prohibitive. This means that only the most efficient and necessary projects can be constructed, leading to a prioritization of projects based on their potential impact and cost-effectiveness. As a result, economic constraints can limit the scope and effectiveness of water management solutions,"}]}
{"paragraph": "1.2 THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE The physical processes controlling the distribution and movement of water are best under- stood in terms of the hydrologic cycle. Although there is no real beginning or ending point of the hydrologic cycle, we can begin the discussion with precipitation. For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume that precipitation consists of rainfall and snowfall. A schematic of the hydrologic cycle for a natural environment is shown in Figure 1-1. Rain falling on Earth may enter a water body directly, travel over the land surface from the point of impact to a watercourse, or infiltrate into the ground. Some rain is intercepted by vegetation; the in- tercepted water is temporarily stored on the vegetation until it evaporates back to the atmos- phere. Some rain is stored in surface depressions, with almost all of the depression storage infiltrating into the ground. Water stored in depressions, water intercepted by vegetation, and water that infiltrates into the soil during the early part of a storm represent the initial losses. The loss is water that does not appear as runoff during or immediately following a rainfall event. Water entering the upland streams travels to increasingly larger rivers and then to the seas and oceans. The water that infil.trates into the ground may percolate to the water table or Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 FIGURE 1-1 Hydrologic cycle of a natural environment. travel in the unsaturated zone until it reappears as surface flow. The amount of water stored in the soil determines, in part, the amount of rain that will infiltrate during the next storm event. Water stored in lakes, seas, and oceans evaporates back to the atmosphere, where it completes the cycle and is available for rainfall. Water also evaporates from soil devoid of vegetation. Rain that falls on vegetated surfaces may be intercepted; however, after the stor- age that is available for interception is filled, the water will immediately fall from the plant surfaces to the ground and infiltrate into the soil in a similar manner as the water falling on bare ground infiltrates. Some of the water stored in the soil near plants is taken up by the roots of the vegetation, and subsequently passed back to the atmosphere from the leaves of the plants; this process is called transpiration. Although it may appear that the hydrologic cycle of a natural environment is static, it is important to recognize that the landscape is constantly undergoing a transformation. High- intensity storms cause erosion of the land surface. Flood runoff from large-volume storms causes bankfull and high-velocity flows in streams with the potential for large amounts of channel erosion. During periods of extreme drought the perimeter of desert lands may in- crease. Forest fires caused either by natural means such as electrical storms or by the care- Sec. 1.3 Hydrologic Designs lessness of human beings cause significant decreases in the available storage and decrease the surface roughness, both of which contribute to increases in surface runoff rates and vol- umes, as well as surface erosion. When mud flows are a potential problem, forest fires con- sume the vegetation, which contributes significantly to the increased production of debris. In many parts of the world, the largest floods result from the rapid melting of snow; such events can be as devastating as floods produced by large rainfall events. Flooding accompanying hurricanes and monsoons can also cause significant changes to the landscape, which by itself affects runoff rates and volumes from storms occurring long after the hurricane or monsoon. In summary, even in a natural environment, rainfall and runoff cause major changes in the watershed. As the population of the world has increased, changes to the land have often been sig- nificant, with major changes to the runoff characteristics of a watershed as a result. Land clearing for agricultural development increases the amount of exposed soil, with obvious de- creases in the protective covering of the natural vegetation. This loss of protective covering decreases the potential for infiltration, increases surface runoff, and can result in significant soil losses. Over the last two centuries, urbanization has caused significant changes to the landscape surrounding these urban centers. Urbanization has had significant effects on the processes of the hydrologic cycle for watersheds subject to the urban development. Clearing of the land has reduced the vegetation and therefore the availability of interception storage; grading of land surfaces reduces the available volume of depression storage. Impervious sur- faces reduce the potential for infiltration and the resulting recharge of ground water storage. Impervious surfaces are also less rough than the natural surfaces and thus offer less resis- tance to the runoff; this change in roughness can increase runoff velocities and surface ero- sion. These changes to the processes of the hydrologic cycle, which are shown schematically in Figure 1-2, cause significant changes in runoff characteristics. The reduced storage results in increased volumes of surface runoff. The reduced surface roughness decreases the travel time of runoff. The reductions in both storage and travel time result in increased peak rates of runoff, which increase both flood damages due to overbank flows and channel erosion. In an attempt to compensate for the lost natural storage, many localities require the re- placement of the lost natural storage with human-made storage. While the storm water deten- tion basin is the most frequently used method of storm water management, other methods are used, such as infiltration pits, rooftop and parking lot storage, and porous pavement. These engineering works do not always return the runoff characteristics to those that existed in the natural environment. In fact, poorly conceived methods of control have, in some cases, made flood runoff conditions worse.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the hydrologic cycle, what happens to rain that falls on Earth?", "answer": "Rain falling on Earth may enter a water body directly, travel over the land surface to a watercourse, or infiltrate into the ground. Some rain is intercepted by vegetation and temporarily stored until it evaporates back to the atmosphere. Additionally, some rain is stored in surface depressions, which eventually infiltrates into the ground."}, {"question": "How does the amount of water stored in the soil affect the infiltration of rain during the next storm event?", "answer": "The amount of water stored in the soil determines, in part, the amount of rain that will infiltrate during the next storm event. This is because the soil's capacity to absorb water is influenced by its current moisture content. If the soil is already saturated, less rain will infiltrate, and more will become runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of water evaporation, why does water stored in lakes, seas, and oceans evaporate back to the atmosphere?", "answer": "Water stored in lakes, seas, and oceans evaporates back to the atmosphere because it completes the hydrologic cycle and becomes available for rainfall. This process is essential for maintaining the balance of the hydrologic cycle. Furthermore, water also evaporates from soil devoid of vegetation, contributing to the continuous cycling of water."}, {"question": "What are the implications of high-intensity storms on the landscape, and how do they affect the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "High-intensity storms cause erosion of the land surface, leading to changes in the landscape. Flood runoff from large-volume storms causes bankfull and high-velocity flows in streams, resulting in significant channel erosion. These changes can alter the hydrologic cycle by modifying the pathways and rates of water flow, ultimately affecting runoff characteristics and water storage. The increased erosion and changes in land surface can also lead to increased sediment transport and altered water quality."}, {"question": "In the context of urbanization, how do changes to the land affect the processes of the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "Urbanization causes significant changes to the landscape, including the reduction of vegetation and the creation of impervious surfaces. These changes reduce the potential for infiltration, increase surface runoff, and decrease the recharge of groundwater storage. The reduced surface roughness also increases runoff velocities and surface erosion, leading to increased peak rates of runoff and flood damages. To mitigate these effects, human-made storage solutions, such as storm water detention basins, are often implemented to replace lost natural storage."}, {"question": "Why do forest fires contribute to increased surface runoff rates and volumes, and what are the implications for the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "Forest fires decrease the available storage and surface roughness, leading to increased surface runoff rates and volumes. The loss of vegetation reduces the interception storage, allowing more water to reach the ground and become runoff. This, in combination with the decreased surface roughness, increases the velocity of runoff, leading to increased erosion and sediment transport. The increased runoff can also lead to flooding and altered water quality, highlighting the need for careful management of watersheds affected by forest fires."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, what happens to water that infiltrates into the ground?", "answer": "Water that infiltrates into the ground may percolate to the water table or travel in the unsaturated zone until it reappears as surface flow. This process is an essential part of the hydrologic cycle, as it helps to recharge groundwater storage and maintain the balance of water flow."}, {"question": "How do changes in land use, such as land clearing for agricultural development, affect the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "Land clearing for agricultural development increases the amount of exposed soil, decreasing the protective covering of natural vegetation. This loss of protective covering reduces the potential for infiltration, increases surface runoff, and can result in significant soil losses. The increased runoff can lead to erosion, flooding, and altered water quality, emphasizing the need for sustainable land management practices."}, {"question": "In the context of storm water management, why are human-made storage solutions, such as storm water detention basins, used to mitigate the effects of urbanization?", "answer": "Human-made storage solutions are used to replace the lost natural storage caused by urbanization.

While many of these miles in- volve travel on the same route, say to or from school or a job, the individual traveler will en- counter a surprisingly large number of engineering designs where hydrologic analyses were required. In fact, hydrology was considered in the design of the very twenty-five miles of highway covered in an average day. Failure to consider drainage of the highway subbase can lead to premature failure of the highway. In addition to subbase design, hydrologic analyses Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 FIGURE 1-2 Hydrologic cycle of a developed environment. are required for the design of culverts (for example, a pipe that crosses under a road or em- bankment), surface drainage inlets, and bridges that cross over rivers and streams. It should be evident that those involved in highway design must understand the basic concepts of hy- drologic analysis since the design of every mile of highway requires consideration of the fun- damental concepts of hydrology. Other elements of transportation systems require hydro- logic analyses. Those involved in the design of parking lots, airport runways and aprons, rapid mass transit lines, and train rights-of-way must give just as much consideration to the proper drainage of storm runoff as those involved in the design of highways. Those involved in the design of transportation facilities are not the only ones who must consider the natural passage of water resulting from storm events. Anyone involved in land development and the construction of homes, as well as commercial, industrial, and institu- tional buildings, must give consideration to storm runoff. Obviously, those involved in home design must provide gutters and down spouts. Buildings in commercial and industrial devel- opments also require roof drainage. There are many other hydrologic analyses required in building construction. When clearing land for development, it is important to provide sediment control facilities to ensure Sec. 1.4 Analysis Versus Synthesis 7 that eroded soil does not enter into waterways and wetlands. Sediment control depends on the area of the land being cleared, the amount of rainfall that can be expected during the pe- riod where the soil will be exposed to rainfall impact, and site characteristics such as the slope and soil type. In addition to hydrologic considerations during the land development stage, site development must consider drainage patterns after development. Site development usually results in significant increases in impervious surfaces, which results in increased surface runoff rates and volumes. In many localities, storm water control facilities are required. In the upper reaches of a site, swales can be used to move water away from buildings and transportation facilities. Concentrated runoff from swales may enter gut- ters and drainage ditches along roadways where the runoff may drain into highway inlets or small streams. At many sites where land development has resulted in large amounts of im- perviousness, on-site detention basins may be required to control the increased runoff. The design of storm water detention basins requires knowledge of routing of water through the hydraulic outlet structure, as well as knowledge about surface runoff into the detention basin. The design must consider meteorological factors, geomorphological factors, and the eco- nomic value of the land, as well as human value considerations such as aesthetic and public safety aspects of the design. The design of a storm water detention basin should also consider the possible effects of inadequate maintenance of the facility. The hydrologic designs discussed in the preceding paragraphs are based primarily on rainfall and the resulting surface runoff. Dams and the water stored in the reservoirs behind the dams provide many benefits, such as power generation, recreation, flood control, irriga- tion, and the maintenance of low flows for water quality control. In addition to estimating the volume of inflow into the reservoir, dam design requires assessment of the evaporation losses from the reservoir. For reservoirs with large surface areas, evaporation losses can be significant. Failure to consider evaporation losses during the design could result in overesti- mating the water that would be available for the purposes stated above. Thus, failure to un- derstand the processes of the hydrologic cycle may render the design inadequate.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of highway design, why is hydrologic analysis crucial?", "answer": "Hydrologic analysis is crucial in highway design because failure to consider drainage of the highway subbase can lead to premature failure of the highway.

{"paragraph": "1.4 ANALYSIS VERSUS SYNTHESIS Like most of the basic sciences, hydrology requires both analysis and synthesis to use the fundamental concepts in the solution of engineering problems. The word analysis is derived from the Greek word analusis, which means \"a releasing,\" and from analuein, whlch means \"to undo.\" In practical terms, it means \"to break apart\" or \"to separate into its fundamental constituents.\" Analysis should be compared with the word synthesis. The word synthesis comes from the Latin word suntithenai, which means \"to put together.\" In practical terms, it means \"to combine separate elements to form a whole.\" Because of the complexity of most hydrologic engineering design problems, the funda- mental elements of the hydrologic sciences cannot be used directly. Instead, it is necessary to take measurements of the response of a hydrologic process and analyze the measurements in an attempt to understand how the process functions. Quite frequently, a model is formulated on the basis of the physical concepts that underlie the process, and the fitting of the model with the measurements provides the basis for understanding how the physical process varies as the input to the process varies. After the measurements have been analyzed (taken apart) 8 Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 to fit the model, the model can be used to synthesize (put together) design rules. That is, the analysis leads to a set of systematic rules that explain how the underlying hydrologic process will function in the future. We recognize that the act of synthesizing is not a total reproduc- tion of the original process. It is a simplification. As with any simplification, it will not pro- vide a totally precise representation of the physical process under all conditions. But in gen- eral, it should provide reasonable solutions, especially when many designs based on the same design rules are considered. It should be emphasized that almost every hydrologic design (or synthesis) was pre- ceded by a hydrologic analysis. Most often, one hydrologic analysis is used as the basis for many, many hydrologic designs. But the important point is that the designer must understand the basis for the analysis that underlies any design method; otherwise, the designer may not apply the design procedure in a way that is compatible with the underlying analysis. This is not to say that a design method cannot be applied without knowing the underlying analysis, only that it is best when the design engineer fully understands the analysis that led to devel- opment of the design rules.

{"paragraph": "1.4.1 Water Budget Analysis and Synthesis A simplified example may help illustrate the concepts of analysis and synthesis. Let's as- sume that an engineer has the task of designing a reservoir, and the design requires estimates of the water loss by evaporation from the reservoir. While the design period will be from June 1 to July 3 1, the engineer is assigned the project just before October 1, with a comple- tion date of April 15 of the following year. Recognizing his lack of experience in making hydrologic evaluations, the engineer correctly decides to hire a hydrologist to perform an analysis to provide a means of making estimates of evaporation. Recognizing that temperature is an important determinant in the evaporation process, the hydrologist decides to develop a design procedure based on a model relating evaporation to temperature. Since there are no meteorological data collection sta- tions in the region of the design, the hydrologist decides to collect data of the monthly evap- oration from a nearby lake and compute the mean monthly temperature. The following data are the result of the data collection effort: Month T E (in.) (OF) October 70 4.3 November 55 3.3 December 5 1 3.2 January 50 2.9 February 53 3.1 March 60 3.6 An examination of the literature suggests that evaporation can be related to tempera- ture using a power model E = b , ~ ~wi'th the values of b, and b, computed using regression Set. 1.4 Analysis Versus Synthesis 9 analysis. The analysis of the data above led to the model E = 0 . 0 4 3 6 8 ~ 'w. i~th~ a~ c~or rela- tion coefficient of 0.98, which suggests that the model should be accurate. To summarize, the analysis problem involved (1) deciding on the variables to use, (2) deciding on the form of the model, (3) collecting the matrix of E and T data shown above, and (4) fitting the model to the data and evaluating the expected accuracy of the design model. The hydrologist pro- vides the engineer with the foregoing model. Given the results of the analysis above, the engineer must now \"put together\" a design. The engineer knows that the mean temperatures for June and July would be about 85°F and 90°F, respectively. Using these temperatures as input to the design model above, evaporation estimates of 5.3 and 5.6 in., respectively, are obtained. Without further consideration, the en- gineer uses these estimates as the basis of the design. The high correlation of 0.98 provides the engineer with a false sense of comfort about the accuracy of estimates. The problem with this description is that the engineer used the results of the analysis (the model) without understanding the analysis. If the hydrologist had known the engineer's objective, the hydrologist would have told the engineer that the model was based on data for the period from October to March, or if the engineer had inquired about the basis for the analysis, the engineer could have made an independent assessment of the results. For exam- ple, for the design location the engineer could have compared the design evaporation esti- mates of 10.9 in. with the mean May-October lake evaporation of 50 in. reported in a cli- matic atlas. The estimate of 11 in. would then have been rejected as being unreasonably low. Although this is a simplified example, it is not uncommon for a hydrologic model to be used without the user taking the time to determine the analysis that underlies the model. In cases where the user is fortunate enough to be applying the model within the proper bounds of the analysis, the accuracy of the design is probably within the limits established by the analysis; however, all too often inaccurate designs result because the assumptions used in the analysis are not valid for the particular design. The moral of the story is that those involved in the analysis phase should clearly define the limits of the model, and those involved in syn- thesis or design should make sure that the design does not require using the model outside the bounds established by the analysis.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of designing a reservoir, why is it crucial to estimate water loss by evaporation accurately?", "answer": "Accurate estimation of water loss by evaporation is crucial in designing a reservoir because it directly affects the reservoir's capacity and the overall water management plan. The engineer in the example needs to estimate evaporation to ensure the reservoir can meet its intended purpose, highlighting the importance of precise hydrologic evaluations. Inaccurate estimates can lead to inefficient water use or insufficient water supply, underscoring the need for reliable data and models."}, {"question": "How does the hydrologist in the example develop a design procedure for estimating evaporation from the reservoir?", "answer": "The hydrologist develops a design procedure by relating evaporation to temperature, using a power model E = b,T^b2, where the values of b1 and b2 are computed using regression analysis of collected data from a nearby lake. This approach allows the hydrologist to create a model that can predict evaporation based on temperature, providing a tool for the engineer to estimate water loss from the reservoir."}, {"question": "In the context of the given example, what is the primary limitation of the model developed by the hydrologist?", "answer": "The primary limitation of the model is that it is based on data collected from October to March, which may not accurately represent the conditions during the design period from June to July. This limitation is critical because the model's accuracy and applicability are constrained to the period and conditions under which the data were collected, potentially leading to inaccurate estimates when applied outside these bounds."}, {"question": "Why is it essential for the engineer to understand the analysis underlying the hydrologic model provided by the hydrologist?", "answer": "Understanding the analysis is crucial because it allows the engineer to assess the model's limitations and applicability to the specific design scenario. Without this understanding, the engineer may use the model outside its valid range, leading to potentially inaccurate designs. The engineer's failure to inquire about the basis of the analysis in the example leads to an underestimate of evaporation, highlighting the importance of communication and critical evaluation in hydrologic design."}, {"question": "How does the high correlation coefficient of 0.98 between evaporation and temperature affect the engineer's perception of the model's accuracy?", "answer": "The high correlation coefficient gives the engineer a false sense of comfort about the model's accuracy. Although a correlation coefficient of 0.98 suggests a strong relationship between evaporation and temperature within the dataset used for the model, it does not guarantee the model's accuracy when applied to different conditions, such as the higher temperatures in June and July. This oversight underscores the importance of considering the model's underlying assumptions and data range."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, what challenge does the example illustrate regarding the application of models in design?", "answer": "The example illustrates the challenge of applying hydrologic models without fully understanding their underlying analysis and limitations. This can lead to inaccurate designs if the model is used outside the bounds of its validity. The challenge is exacerbated by the potential for high correlation coefficients to mask limitations in the model's applicability, emphasizing the need for careful model selection, validation, and application in hydrologic design."}, {"question": "What would be an appropriate step for the engineer to validate the evaporation estimates obtained from the hydrologist's model?", "answer": "An appropriate step would be for the engineer to compare the design evaporation estimates with independent data, such as the mean May-October lake evaporation reported in a climatic atlas. This comparison can help the engineer assess whether the estimates are reasonable and within expected bounds, providing an additional check on the model's applicability and accuracy for the design location and period."}, {"question": "How does the example highlight the importance of communication between the hydrologist and the engineer in hydrologic design?", "answer": "The example shows that effective communication between the hydrologist and the engineer is crucial for ensuring that the hydrologic model is appropriately applied in the design. If the hydrologist had informed the engineer about the model's limitations and the data period it was based on, or if the engineer had inquired about these aspects, the potential for error could have been mitigated. This underscores the need for clear communication of model assumptions, limitations, and applicability in hydrologic design projects."}, {"question": "In the context of water budget analysis, why is it important to consider the temporal and spatial variability of hydrologic processes?", "answer": "Considering temporal and spatial variability is important because hydrologic processes such as evaporation can vary significantly over time and space. The example illustrates how the model developed from data collected during one part of the year may not accurately represent conditions during another part of the year, leading to potential errors in water budget analysis and design. Accounting for this variability is essential for developing accurate and reliable hydrologic models."}]}
{"paragraph": "1.4.2 A Conceptual Representation Because of the importance of the concepts of analysis and synthesis, it will be worthwhile to place the problem in a conceptual framework. We will conceptualize the hydrologic system to consist of three parts: the input, the output, and the transfer function. This conceptual framework is shown schematically in Figure 1-3. In the analysis phase, the input and output are known and the analyst must find a rational model of the transfer function. When the analysis phase is completed, either the model of the transfer function or design tools devel- oped from the model are ready to be used in the synthesis phase. In the synthesis or design phase, the design input and the model of the transfer function are known, and the predicted INPUT TRANSFER OUTPUT FIGURE 1-3 Conceptual representa- tion of the systems process. Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 system output must be computed; the true system output is unknown. The designer predicts the response of the system using the model and bases the engineering design solution of the predicted or synthesized response. The reservoir design problem can be used to illustrate this conceptual framework of hydrologic analysis and design. In this simplified problem, the evaporation is needed for de- sign; thus the evaporation serves as the output variable. Temperature serves as the input. In the analysis phase, the model for predicting evaporation is evaluated; therefore, the model represents all of the hydrologic processes involved in converting temperature (for example, heat energy) to evaporation. Obviously, temperature is only a single measurement of the processes that effect evaporation, but it is a surrogate variable for these processes in the con- ceptual representation of the system. In the design phase, the designer uses other temperature conditions as input to the model to predict the response (for example, the output) of the sys- tem. It is this synthesis of the system output that is used for the design. In summary, in the analysis phase, the temperature (input) and evaporation (output) were known, while in the synthesis phase, the temperature (input) and the model (transfer function) were known. Ex- amples of the analysis/synthesis representation that will be discussed in other chapters are given in Table 1- 1.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic analysis and design, what are the three main components of the conceptual framework?", "answer": "The three main components are the input, the output, and the transfer function."}, {"question": "How does the analysis phase differ from the synthesis phase in hydrologic system modeling?", "answer": "In the analysis phase, the input and output are known, and the analyst must find a rational model of the transfer function. In contrast, during the synthesis phase, the design input and the model of the transfer function are known, and the predicted system output must be computed."}, {"question": "Why is temperature used as a surrogate variable in the conceptual representation of the hydrologic system for predicting evaporation?", "answer": "Temperature is used as a surrogate variable because it is a single measurement that represents the various hydrologic processes involved in converting heat energy to evaporation, making it a practical choice for modeling."}, {"question": "In the context of reservoir design, what is the role of evaporation, and how is it related to the input variable?", "answer": "Evaporation serves as the output variable, and it is related to the input variable (temperature) through the model of the transfer function, which represents all the hydrologic processes involved in converting temperature to evaporation. The model is evaluated in the analysis phase and then used in the synthesis phase to predict evaporation under different temperature conditions. This process allows designers to predict the response of the system and base their engineering design solutions on the predicted output."}, {"question": "How does the conceptual framework of hydrologic analysis and design facilitate the engineering design solution?", "answer": "The conceptual framework facilitates the engineering design solution by providing a structured approach to analyzing and synthesizing the hydrologic system. In the analysis phase, it helps in developing a rational model of the transfer function, which is then used in the synthesis phase to predict the system output under given input conditions. This predicted output serves as the basis for the engineering design solution, allowing designers to make informed decisions based on the modeled behavior of the hydrologic system."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the synthesis phase in hydrologic system modeling, and how does it contribute to the design process?", "answer": "The synthesis phase is significant because it allows designers to use the model of the transfer function to predict the system output under various input conditions, which is crucial for designing hydrologic systems. This phase contributes to the design process by enabling designers to evaluate different scenarios, predict the system's response, and select the most appropriate design solution based on the predicted outcomes. The synthesis phase essentially bridges the gap between analysis and design, making the conceptual framework a powerful tool for hydrologic engineering."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic analysis, why is it important to distinguish between the analysis and synthesis phases?", "answer": "Distinguishing between the analysis and synthesis phases is important because it clarifies the objectives and methodologies of each phase. The analysis phase focuses on understanding the system's behavior and developing a model of the transfer function, whereas the synthesis phase uses this model to predict the system's output under given conditions. This distinction is crucial for ensuring that the model developed during analysis is appropriately applied during synthesis to achieve the design objectives."}, {"question": "How does the use of a surrogate variable like temperature in hydrologic modeling affect the accuracy of predictions?", "answer": "The use of a surrogate variable like temperature can affect the accuracy of predictions because it simplifies the complex hydrologic processes involved. While temperature can represent the effects of various processes on evaporation, it might not capture all the nuances and variability of these processes. Therefore, the accuracy of predictions based on such a model depends on how well the surrogate variable represents the actual processes and how robust the model of the transfer function is."}, {"question": "In what ways can the conceptual framework of hydrologic analysis and design be applied to real-world problems?", "answer": "The conceptual framework can be applied to real-world problems by identifying the input, output, and transfer function relevant to the specific problem. For instance, in reservoir design, temperature and evaporation can be used as input and output variables, respectively. By developing a model of the transfer function that relates these variables, designers can predict the system's response to different input conditions, facilitating informed decision-making. This approach can be adapted to various hydrologic problems, such as watershed management, flood control, and water resource allocation, by appropriately defining the input, output, and transfer function for each context."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to develop a comprehensive model of the transfer function in hydrologic systems?", "answer": "Developing a comprehensive model of the transfer function is challenging because hydrologic systems involve complex and interconnected processes. These processes can be influenced by numerous factors, including climatic conditions, geological characteristics, and human activities, making it difficult to capture all the relevant dynamics in a single model. Furthermore, the use of surrogate variables, while practical, can introduce simplifications that might not fully represent the system's behavior, adding to the challenge of developing an accurate"}]}
{"paragraph": "1.5 THE HYDROLOGIC BUDGET The systems concept of Figure 1-3 can be applied to the elements of the hydrologic cycle, which can be viewed as inputs, outputs, and storages. Rainfall can be viewed as an input to the surface of Earth. The surface can be viewed as a series of storage elements, such as stor- age on the surface of vegetation and depression storage. Runoff from the surface can be viewed as an output from surface storage elements. This would be a systems representation of the physical processes controlling surface runoff. If river channel processes are the important elements of the hydrologic design, then the surface runoff can be viewed as the input, the channel itself as the storage element, and the runoff out of the channel (into another channel, a lake, or an ocean) as the output from the system. Hydrologic analysts and designers make use of this systems representation of the elements of the hydrologic cycle to develop design methods to solve engineering problems. The conceptual representation of hydrologic systems can be stated in mathematical terms. Letting I, 0,S , and t denote the input, output, storage, and time, respectively, the fol- lowing equation is known as the linear storage equation: The derivative on the right-hand side of Equation 1-1 can be approximated by the numerical equivalent AS/ At, when one wishes to examine the change in storage between two times, say t2 and t,. In this case, Equation 1-1 becomes in which S,- and S, are the storages at times t2 and t,, respectively.

Storage (S) Runoff Volume (Q) Q, p Rainfall (P) (Eq. 742) 12 Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 Equation 1-1 can be illustrated using the flow in a river as the input and output. As- sume that the inflow and outflow rates to a river reach of 1500 ft in length are 40 ft3/sec and 30 ft3/sec, respectively. Therefore, the rate of change in storage equals 10 ft3/sec or 6000 ft3 during a 10 min period. Since the inflow is greater than the outflow, the water surface eleva- tion will rise. Assuming an average width of 16 ft, the increased storage would cause the water surface elevation to rise by 6000 ft3/[16 ft (1500 ft)] = 0.25 ft over the 10 min period. The storage equation of Equation 1-1 can be used for other types of hydrologic prob- lems. Estimates of evaporation losses from a lake could be made by measuring: all inputs, such as rainfall (I,), inflow from streams (I,), and ground-water inflow (I,); all outputs, such as streamflow out of the lake (O,), ground-water flow out of the lake (O,), and evaporation from the lake (0,); and the change in storage between two time periods, which could be eval- uated using the lake levels measured at the beginning and end of the time period. In this case, both the input and the output involve multiple measurements, that is, they are vector quanti- ties with the elements of each vector I, and 0, representing the different components of the inflow and outflow from the system. The unknown is one of the elements of the outflow vec- tor. Mathematically, the water balance is Estimating evaporation losses (0,) would require measurements of each of the inflows, the other outflows, and lake levels; obviously, any errors in the measurements of the elements of Equation 1-3 would effect the accuracy of the estimated evaporation. Also, if there are any inflows other than I,, I,, and I, or any outflows other than 0, and O,, the estimated evapora- tion will be in error by such amounts. In summary, the hydrologic budget is a convenient way of modeling the elements of the hydrologic cycle. It will be used frequently in describing the problems of analysis and design.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic systems, how does the concept of input, output, and storage apply to surface runoff?", "answer": "The concept of input, output, and storage in hydrologic systems applies to surface runoff by viewing rainfall as an input to the Earth's surface, the surface as a series of storage elements (such as storage on vegetation and in depressions), and runoff from the surface as an output from these storage elements. This systems representation helps in understanding the physical processes controlling surface runoff. For instance, if river channel processes are crucial, surface runoff can be seen as the input, the channel as the storage element, and the runoff out of the channel as the output. This approach allows hydrologic analysts and designers to develop design methods for solving engineering problems related to surface runoff."}, {"question": "Why is the linear storage equation significant in hydrologic analysis, and what does it represent?", "answer": "The linear storage equation is significant because it provides a mathematical representation of the conceptual hydrologic system, allowing for the analysis of changes in storage over time. It represents the relationship between input (I), output (O), storage (S), and time (t), given by the equation dS/dt = I - O. This equation can be approximated numerically as ΔS/Δt = I - O, enabling the examination of storage changes between two time periods. The equation is crucial for understanding and predicting various hydrologic phenomena, including runoff and evaporation losses."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating evaporation losses from a lake, what measurements are required, and how do errors in these measurements affect the accuracy of the estimated evaporation?", "answer": "To estimate evaporation losses from a lake, measurements of all inputs (such as rainfall, inflow from streams, and groundwater inflow) and all outputs (including streamflow out of the lake, groundwater flow out of the lake, and evaporation from the lake) are necessary. Additionally, the change in storage between two time periods, evaluated using lake levels at the beginning and end of the period, is required. Errors in measuring these elements can significantly affect the accuracy of the estimated evaporation. For instance, any inaccuracies in measuring inflows or other outflows will directly impact the estimated evaporation, as the water balance equation relies on the precise measurement of all components. Furthermore, if there are unaccounted inflows or outflows, the estimated evaporation will be erroneous by the amount of these unconsidered flows."}, {"question": "How does the hydrologic budget concept facilitate the modeling of the hydrologic cycle, and what are its implications for analysis and design in hydrology?", "answer": "The hydrologic budget concept facilitates the modeling of the hydrologic cycle by providing a systematic approach to account for all inputs, outputs, and changes in storage within a hydrologic system. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrologic processes and enables the identification of unknowns, such as evaporation losses, by balancing the inputs and outputs. The implications of the hydrologic budget for analysis and design in hydrology are significant, as it provides a framework for solving engineering problems. By applying the hydrologic budget concept, hydrologic analysts and designers can develop methods to estimate various hydrologic parameters, such as runoff coefficients, peak discharges, and evaporation losses, which are essential for the design of hydrologic systems and the management of water resources."}, {"question": "In the context of river flow, how can the storage equation be applied to understand changes in water surface elevation?", "answer": "The storage equation can be applied to understand changes in water surface elevation in a river by considering the inflow and outflow rates. For example, if the inflow rate is greater than the outflow rate, the storage in the river increases, leading to a rise in the water surface elevation. By calculating the change in storage over a given time period and knowing the average width of the river, the increase in water surface elevation can be determined. This application of the storage equation is useful for predicting flood levels, managing water storage, and understanding the dynamics of river flow."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider all components of the hydrologic cycle when applying the hydrologic budget concept?", "answer": "It is essential to consider all components of the hydrologic cycle when applying the hydrologic budget concept because any omission or error in measuring these components can lead to inaccuracies in estimating unknowns, such as evaporation losses. The hydrologic budget equation relies on the balance between inputs, outputs, and changes in storage, and neglecting any of these elements can result in erroneous conclusions. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that accounts for all aspects of the hydrologic cycle is necessary for accurate analysis and design in hydrology."}, {"question": "How does the systems representation of hydrologic processes facilitate the development of design methods for solving engineering problems?", "answer": "The systems representation of hydrologic processes facilitates the development of design methods for solving engineering problems by providing a structured approach to understanding"}]}
{"paragraph": "1.6 INTRODUCTION TO PROFESSIONAL ETHICS The chapters of this book detail various methods of hydrologic analysis and design. This may imply that the heart of hydrologic work is the number crunching. While the hydrologist must certainly understand the physical processes and know the design procedures, he or she must also recognize that designs are necessary because society has needs and problems.

{"paragraph": "1.6.1 Case Studies To create a foundation for a discussion of the social responsibilities of professionals who are involved in hydrologic analysis and design, it is worthwhile to sketch four hypothetical situa- tions that involve value issues in a professional setting. The initial emphasis should be on identifying the value issues. The task of solving value dilemmas that arise in professional practice will be discussed later. Case Study 1. The firm for which you work obtains a contract for designing a pip to carry a liquid hazardous waste between the plant where it is produced as a by-product an a storage facility where it is held until it can be transported to a disposal site. The two sites are 1.2 miles apart. During the site investigation you find that the route proposed by the client passes through a very permeable geologic formation (see Chapter 6). You recognize that a leak or rupture of the pipe in the area of the permeable formation could cause signifi- cant problems with the quality of the water withdrawn from the aquifer. You bring the problem to the attention of your supervisor and propose an alternative route for the pipe. Your proposal would increase both the length of the pipe and the cost of the project, as well as delay the completion date of the project. Your supervisor tells you that the project is to be completed as planned and that the potential hazard is not your concern. What are the values that are in conflict? What action, if any, should you take? Case Study 2. The firm that you work for obtains a contract for constructing a water supply reservoir. You find out that the proposed site is above an area that is zoned for com- mercial and high-density residential land uses, although the areas are currently undeveloped. Based on this, you recognize that state policy would require the hydrologic design to be based on a probable maximum flood analysis (see Chapter 4). You indicate to your project manager that you have no experience with PMF analyses and that no one else in the firm has the experience. After you recommend that the firm hire an outside consultant who has the necessary experience, the project manager indicates that your proposal is not economically feasible and that you will be responsible for the design. What are the value issues involved in this case? Recognizing that the effort is outside your area of professional competency, what action, if any, should you take? Case Study 3. A public agency issues a request for proposals on a design project that is in your area of professional expertise. Your supervisor indicates that you will be in charge of writing the proposal, which you believe will be a three- to four-week effort. Your supervi- sor tells you to charge the time to a project that is currently in progress but to which you have no involvement and is totally unrelated to the project for which you will be writing the pro- posal. You believe that your time should be reimbursed using company overhead funds, rather than funds from another client. Your supervisor rejects your concern about charging time to a project on which you were not involved and states that if you want to get paid, you must charge your time as instructed. What are the value issues that are in conflict? What ac- tion, if any, should you take? Case Study 4. The firm that you work for discharges wastes into a local stream. It is your responsibility to take samples for specific water quality indicators, make the necessary 14 Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 laboratory tests, and report the results to the local public health agency. On a regular basis, you inform your supervisor of the test results prior to providing a summary of the results to the local public health agency. At one reporting date you find that the effluent from your firm's plant does not meet state water quality standards.

{"paragraph": "1.7 THE DIMENSIONS OF PROFESSIONALISM When we hear the word professional, we may think of a professional athlete, or maybe even a hired killer. After, all, the most general definition of the word professional provided by a dictionary would be something like the following: one who is engaged in a specific activity as a source of livelihood. Using this definition, almost all people who work could be classed as professionals. Plumbers, grave diggers, used-car salespersons, and chimney sweepers are engaged in specific activities as a source of livelihood. The intent here is not to say that the grave diggers and football players are not professionals; they certainly are needed citizens and have skills that are used in service to society. But certain specific activities are accorded the status of professions; for example, doctors, members of the clergy, and teachers perform activities that indicate that they belong to professions. These professions are usually thought to require a higher level of knowledge than others that just satisfy the dictionary definition of a professional because they serve society in special ways. It is in this sense that we want to classify hydrologists as professionals; while hydrologists engage in specific activities as a set. 1.7 The Dimensions of Professionalism 15 source of livelihood, their work carries special responsibilities to society that accords their work the status of a profession. In his discussion of professional development, Dougherty (1961) defines a profes- sional as one who uses specialized knowledge and skill in the solution of problems that cannot be stan- dardized. He [or she] is actuated by a service motive; he [or she] works in a relation of confi- dence, and observes an acceptable code of ethical conduct. But it must be emphasized that the term professional does not apply just to someone who has specialized knowledge and skill. Other dimensions of professionalism are impor- tant. In the definition above, Dougherty recognized the multifaceted nature of professional- ism, and from this he made the following conclusion: Professionalism is a way of thinking and living rather than an accumulation of knowledge and power. Knowledge and power are essential and when actuated by the professional spirit they produce the leaders and torch-bearers. What are the fundamental dimensions of professionalism, all of which are necessary for an individual to be considered a professional? NSPE (1976) identified five characteristics of a professional engineer; these also apply to those practicing hydrologic design work: 1 One who possesses a body of distinctive technical knowledge and art gained by educa- tion, research, and experience. 2. One who recognizes a service motive to society in vital and honorable activities. 3. One who believes in standards of conduct, such as represented by ethical rules. 4. One who supports the legal status of admission to the profession. The most common forms are registration to practice engineering and graduation from an accredited engi- neering cumculum. 5. One who has pride in the profession and a desire to promote technical knowledge and professional ideals. To these five characteristics, Dougherty's definition identifies a sixth factor that should be emphasized as a fundamental characteristic, even though it may be inherent in the five char- acteristics listed. 6. One who works in a relation of confidence to his employer, the public, and all who use his or her works. Considerable time, education, and professional practice are required to obtain the spe- cialized knowledge and skill that characterize a professional. The professional, in contrast to the artisan or technician, is capable of synthesizing past experience and fundamental princi- ples in solving new problems. Such problem solving requires independent thought and moti- vation that is not self-serving. The motivation must stem from a dedication to service of both society and the profession; otherwise, the knowledge and skill does not maximize human welfare. Because of the interaction of a professional with society and the advantage that the 16 Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 professional has through his or her specialized knowledge and skill, it is important for a pro- fessional to have sound moral judgment and be able and willing to translate this moral judg- ment into principled professional conduct.

In contrast, specific activities like those of doctors, clergy, and teachers are accorded the status of professions due to their higher level of knowledge and special service to society. This distinction highlights that not all professionals, as defined by the dictionary, are considered part of a profession in the context of requiring specialized knowledge and ethical conduct."}, {"question": "Why is it important for hydrologists to be considered professionals, and what responsibilities come with this status?", "answer": "Hydrologists are considered professionals because their work carries special responsibilities to society, requiring a higher level of knowledge and ethical conduct. This status is important because hydrologists' work has a significant impact on society, and they must be able to synthesize past experience and fundamental principles to solve new problems, which demands independent thought and motivation not driven by self-interest.

{"paragraph": "1.8 HUMAN VALUES A value can be defined as a principle or quality considered worthwhile or desirable. As used here, a human value is a quality that relates directly to the potential for improving the condi- tions of humankind. The ability to make a value decision is one of the characteristics that distinguishes human beings from other living things. Along with this ability goes the respon- sibility to make value decisions in an unbiased and precise way. To make accurate value de- cisions, it is necessary for the decision maker to understand his or her value system and es- tablish value priorities. He or she must also know and understand the values held important by the profession. Thls requires a certain commitment to examine critically one's own value priorities. Unfortunately, too few people take the time to make an assessment of their value system. Individuals are guided by standards established by their family and friends; peer pressure is all too often used as an excuse for improper conduct. While \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" is probably the most famous value statement and \"I love you\" is the most frequently used value statement, there are numerous other values. The following is a partial list of human values: beautylaesthetics honor mercy cleanliness honesty pleasurehappiness courage kindness public healtwsafety diligence knowledge respect efficiency life security equality love truth freedom~liberty loyalty wisdom These values represent feelings or attitudes rather than physical entities. This does not mean that a scale could not be developed in an attempt to reflect variations in a feeling or attitude. Industrial engineers are constantly trying to find rules and yardsticks to measure efficiency. Environmental engineers develop standards that define when minimum levels of public health are not being met. Engineering planners attempt to define indices that measure the beauty of an engineering project, and wildlife biologists develop indices to measure changes in the quality of life for animals whose habitat is affected by engineering projects. While such attempts make it possible to incorporate value issues into the quantitative decision- making framework, all too often hydrologists, as well as those in other professions, fail to recognize that everyone affected by a project may not agree with the scale used to quantify a human value. Such disagreement is the basis for value conflicts in a professional setting. But at least the hydrologist can attempt to incorporate value issues into the decision-making process. The relative effort that a hydrologist expends in developing a scale to measure the Sec. 1.9 Values in Hydrology 17 various states of the value issue may be an indication of the sensitivity of the hydrologist to human values.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of human values in hydrology, what is a value defined as?", "answer": "A value is defined as a principle or quality considered worthwhile or desirable, relating directly to the potential for improving the conditions of humankind."}, {"question": "How do hydrologists incorporate value issues into the decision-making process?", "answer": "Hydrologists can attempt to incorporate value issues into the decision-making process by developing scales to measure human values, such as efficiency, public health, or beauty, although recognizing that everyone affected by a project may not agree with the scale used."}, {"question": "Why is it essential for hydrologists to understand their own value system and establish value priorities?", "answer": "Understanding one's own value system and establishing value priorities is essential for hydrologists to make accurate value decisions in an unbiased and precise way, which is a critical aspect of their profession.

{"paragraph": "1.9 VALUES IN HYDROLOGY While all hydrologists recognize the importance of the technical issues in the workplace, they should also recognize that hydrologists do not practice in a value vacuum. Decisions in- volving human values are important to the individual, the firm, the profession, and society. In mahng value-based decisions, the individual usually places far greater weight on the con- sequences to himself or herself, such as the potential loss of employment or stature within the professional community, than on the consequences to the firm, the profession, or society. Also, the person quickly becomes aware of the personal stress that accompanies value con- flicts. The person has moral obligations to his or her family, and these personal responsibili- ties cannot be ignored when solving ethical dilemmas in the workplace. Although profes- sional codes of ethics do not require the hydrologist to be self-sacrificing, the individual must be willing to consider values important to the firm, the profession, and society in mak- ing value decisions, not just the values that are important to him or herself. Proper value de- cision mahng requires the person to give weight to and properly balance value responsibili- ties to each of the parties. To make value decisions that best meet the ethical rights of all parties involved, the values that are important to all parties need to be identified and respected in the decision. In the case of the hydrologist who was told to file false time reports, he/she placed emphasis on values such as honesty and security. He/she may not have recognized the values that were important to his or her supervisor. The supervisor placed emphasis on values such as loyalty, performance, and respect, but showed little regard to the values that were important to either the hydrologist or society. Neither the hydrologist nor the supervisor recognized that their actions impacted on values that are important either to the profession, such as honor, or to society, such as truth in matters that affect society. Such failure to recognize values that are important to all parties involved may lead to nonoptimal decisions. In such cases, incorrect value decisions can lead to expulsion from the profession. Values that should be important to the firm include honesty, responsibility, loyalty, ef- ficiency, and harmony. Failure of an individual hydrologist to consider the value rights of the firm in solving ethical conflicts reduces the effectiveness of the firm in meeting its societal responsibilities. When a person fails to recognize the values that are important to the firm, it is often viewed by the firm to reflect disloyalty. While ethical problems such as those discussed in Section 1.6.1 may appear to have ef- fects only to the person and the firm, they, in fact, can impact on the profession and society. Knowledge, honor, and integrity are just three human values that are important to the profes- sion, and incorrect decisions to an ethical conflict can adversely affect these values. For ex- ample, the use of computer software for design by a hydrologist who is not familiar with the underlying theory might imply to society that knowledge, as well as the societal value of public safety, is not important to the profession. In this case, the design hydrologist and the firm appear to be insensitive to values that are considered to be important to both the profes- sion and society. Failed designs can lead to unnecessary regulation of the profession by soci- Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 ces high value on public safety and efficiency, with the value of eta1 institutions.

When making a personal value decision, just one or two parties are usually involved, for ex- ample, oneself and a friend. When making value decisions in professional life, numerous parties are involved. In addition to ethical responsibilities to oneself and family, the profes- sional has legitimate and important ethical responsibilities to the employer, the client, the id profession, socieq.

Internal appeal refers to actions taken within the fm to solve an ethical dilemma. External appeal refers to actions with respect to parties outside the fm.E xcept under unusual circumstances, all internal options should be consid- ered in attempting to resolve an ethical conflict before seeking an external solution. The in- ternal options are separated into three levels (see Table 1-2): individual preparation, cornrnu- nication with supervisor, and initiation of the formal internal appeals process. It is important to follow the appeals process in the sequence shown. As a first step, it is to the advantage of the employee to develop accurate records of the facts and details of the conflict, familiarize himself or herself with the appeals process of solving ethical conflicts within the company, and identify alternative courses of action. At this point, it is also extremely important for the individual to know exactly what he or she expects any appeal to accomplish. It is inadequate just to state that there appears to be a problem; ideally, the employee can propose a solution that can resolve the problem. As stated previously, the person must recognize the moral rights of the firm, the profession, and society, not just show concern for the effects on him- self or herself. Sec. 1.

External appeal options A. Personal options 1. Engage legal counsel 2. Contact a professional society B. Communication with client C. Contact the media Once the person has studied and documented the facts and formulated a plan for the appeal, the matter should be informally discussed with his or her immediate supervisor. In most cases, problems can be resolved at this level, which is to the benefit of all parties in- volved. In some cases, a more formal appeal to the immediate supervisor is necessary; this is usually in the form of a memorandum that clearly states the facts, the individual's concerns, and the actions that would be necessary to resolve the concerns. It should be evident that good communication slulls are important in solving ethical conflicts because a failure to clearly state the concerns, whether orally or in writing, may hinder the resolution of the prob- lem. Appealing the problem to higher levels before completing the appeal to the immediate supervisor are viewed negatively by all involved and will decrease the likelihood of a favor- able resolution. Finally, before continuing the appeal beyond the immediate supervisor, an individual should inform the supervisor in writing of the intention to continue the appeal to higher authorities. The process of appealing an ethical conflict within the firm is usually quite similar to the interaction with the immediate supervisor. Formal steps should follow informal discus- sions, and steps within the process should not be bypassed. If the internal appeals process is completed without a resolution of the conflict, the person should formally notify the com- pany that he or she intends to continue with an external review of the problem. Before expressing any concern to the client or making concerns public, a lawyer andlor professional society should be consulted. Lawyers can identify courses of action and pitfalls in external appeal. Whereas lawyers understand legal constraints and consequences, they often lack the technical expertise that would be necessary to evaluate the technical adequacy of your arguments. Professional societies have such technical expertise available and may be willing to informally discuss the case and make recommendations; however, they may not have a complete understanding of the legal implications. Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 After engaging legal counsel andlor obtaining advice from a professional society, the individual may elect to approach the client. In many cases, the client lacks the expertise to judge the accuracy of the claims and will rely on the advice of the firm in evaluating the con- cerns; however, if the issues involved in the conflict can be accurately communicated, the client may pressure the firm to resolve the issue internally. Alternatively, the client may ex- pend the resources that would be necessary to obtain an unbiased review of the matter. While it is extremely rare that it will be necessary to carry the appeals process to the client, the ef- fects on one's professional career can be very detrimental if the results fail to find validity in the arguments. The last resort in solving ethical conflicts is public disclosure. The benefits and costs in terms of both economic criteria and nonquantifiable value goals should be rigorously as- sessed before contacting the media. It is not even in the best interest of society to make pub- lic disclosure prior to seeking an internal resolution. The only case where public disclosure is acceptable prior to following the appeals process (Table 1-2) is when an immediate danger to the public exists. Four situations in which ethical dilemmas existed were introduced in Section 1.6.1. While the four situations were quite different in many respects, the process of Table 1-2 can be used in resolving each of the conflicts. The problem of falsifying time reports is best han- dled with the hydrologist informally discussing the situation with the supervisor. In discus- sion, the hydrologist should clearly state the value conflict created by the supervisor's re- quest to falsify the time sheets. He or she might try to persuade the supervisor to change the way in which project accounts are handled so that actions that violate an employee's value system are not necessary. Furthermore, the employee might point out that such a requirement reduces the employee's respect for the firm and may affect his or her sense of loyalty. By ap- pealing to the supervisor in terms of the values that are of interest to the firm, the supervisor may be more responsive than if the hydrologist only showed concern with his or her own position.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrological ethics, what should a young hydrologist do when instructed to falsify time reports or water quality test results?", "answer": "The hydrologist should follow the internal appeal options, starting with individual preparation, then communicating with the supervisor, and finally initiating the formal internal appeals process if necessary."}, {"question": "Why is it important to distinguish between internal and external appeal in solving ethical conflicts within the workplace?", "answer": "Distinguishing between internal and external appeal is crucial because it allows the hydrologist to exhaust all internal options before seeking external solutions, which may have negative consequences on the individual, firm, profession, and society."}, {"question": "How does the process of appealing an ethical conflict within a firm typically proceed?", "answer": "The process typically starts with informal discussions with the immediate supervisor, followed by formal steps if necessary, and proceeds through the internal chain of command. It is essential to maintain formal communication and not bypass steps in the process. If the internal appeals process is completed without resolution, the individual may then consider external appeal options, such as consulting a lawyer or professional society, before approaching the client or making public disclosure."}, {"question": "In what situations is public disclosure of an ethical conflict acceptable?", "answer": "Public disclosure is acceptable when an immediate danger to the public exists, or after exhausting all internal and external appeal options, and only after rigorously assessing the benefits and costs in terms of economic criteria and non-quantifiable value goals."}, {"question": "Why is it beneficial to engage legal counsel and/or obtain advice from a professional society before approaching the client or making public disclosure?", "answer": "Engaging legal counsel and/or obtaining advice from a professional society is beneficial because lawyers can identify courses of action and pitfalls in external appeal, while professional societies have technical expertise to evaluate the technical adequacy of arguments. This helps the individual to make informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls."}, {"question": "How can a hydrologist effectively communicate ethical concerns to a supervisor?", "answer": "A hydrologist can effectively communicate ethical concerns by clearly stating the value conflict, explaining how the issue affects their own values and the firm's interests, and proposing alternative solutions that align with the firm's values and goals. This approach shows that the hydrologist is concerned not only with their own position but also with the firm's well-being and reputation."}, {"question": "What are the potential consequences of not following the proper procedure in solving ethical conflicts?", "answer": "The potential consequences of not following the proper procedure include adverse effects on the individual, both professionally and personally, as well as negative effects on the firm, the profession, and society. Additionally, not following the proper procedure may lead to a decrease in the likelihood of a favorable resolution and may damage the individual's professional career."}, {"question": "In the context of ethical conflicts, why is it essential to maintain accurate records of events and details?", "answer": "Maintaining accurate records of events and details is essential because it allows the individual to clearly state the facts and concerns, propose alternative courses of action, and specify the expected outcome of the appeal. This helps to build a strong case and ensures that the individual's concerns are taken seriously."}, {"question": "How can a hydrologist identify alternative courses of action when faced with an ethical dilemma?", "answer": "A hydrologist can identify alternative courses of action by examining the firm's internal appeals process, knowing federal and state laws, and considering the potential consequences of different actions. This involves analyzing the situation, evaluating the available options, and selecting the most appropriate course of action that aligns with the hydrologist's values and the firm's goals."}, {"question": "What role do professional societies play in resolving ethical conflicts?", "answer": "Professional societies play a crucial role in resolving ethical conflicts by providing technical expertise to evaluate the technical adequacy of arguments and offering informal discussions and recommendations. They can help individuals navigate complex ethical issues and provide guidance on the best course of action. However, it is essential to note that professional societies may not have a complete understanding of the legal implications, and therefore, it is often necessary to consult with a lawyer as well."}, {"question": "Why is it important for a hydrologist to recognize the moral rights of the firm, the profession, and society when resolving ethical conflicts?", "answer": "Recognizing the moral rights of the firm, the profession, and society is important because it allows the hydrologist to consider the broader implications of their actions and make decisions that not only benefit themselves but also the firm, the profession, and society as a whole. This involves taking a holistic approach to ethical decision-making, considering multiple perspectives, and evaluating the potential consequences of different actions."}, {"question": "How can a hydrologist ensure that their concerns are taken seriously when appealing an ethical conflict?", "answer": "A hydrologist can ensure that their concerns are taken seriously by maintaining formal communication, following the proper procedure, and providing clear and accurate documentation of"}]}
{"paragraph": "1.11 RATIONALIZATION In Case Study 4 of Section 1.6.1, how does the supervisor justify asking the employee to fal- sify the water quality report? In Case Study 2, how does the project manager justify asking someone to perform hydrologic engineering work that is clearly outside the individual's competency? If instead of these professional case studies, we were to ask how a student justi- fies cheating on a test, the response would probably involve \"rationalization.\" In many cases, this is a primary factor in unethical professional conduct. Rationalization is the mental process of completely falsifying the results of one's ac- tions so that he or she is incapable of regretting the action (Ross, 1972). It is a form of self- deception, for the purpose of justifying one's actions. Rationalization serves two purposes (Ross, 1972). First, it serves as an excuse to avoid guilt feelings and the scorn of others. Sec- ond, it provides self-justification of an action, thus excusing the individual from making a change in his or her moral decision process. What are possible rationalizations that professionals could employ to provide self- justification for their actions? In Case Study 4, the supervisor justifies the action of request- Sec. 1 .I 2 Concluding Thoughts 2 1 ing the engineer to file a false report by arguing that the test results are probably incorrect and that, if additional tests were made, they would prove that the standards are being met. The supervisor believes that his or her professional experience is more accurate than some laboratory tests. Other common rationalizations to justify unethical conduct are that, \"everybody is doing it\" or, \"if I don't do it, someone will.\" If the individual can convince him or herself that everyone is doing it, then the individual will feel less guilt because he or she believes that they are on the same moral level as others in comparable positions. Using such logic, it follows that it is not necessary to rise to a level of ethical conduct that is higher than that of his or her peers. The rationalization makes it unnecessary to consider the value rights of oth- ers and enables the supervisor to repeat the conduct in the future. What rationalization might the young engineer make in order to charge the time to the incorrect account? The following are a few responses: 1. It is standard business practice. 2. I am only doing what I am told to do. 3. It is only a small amount of money. 4. It is the manager's responsibility to decide money matters. 5. I want to be loyal to the company. Any one of these might serve the immediate needs of the individual and the firm, but does it meet the needs of the profession, society, or the client who is paying for someone to work on another client's project? Society values truth. The profession values the integrity of its mem- bers, as well as its reputation. The client values trust. These values are being given zero weight in the decision. Instead, the young engineer is placing value on personal needs and the supervisor is valuing efficiency within the firm. Neither the engineer nor the supervisor is properly balancing the value issues. Their rationalizations are serving as the means to place selfish ends before the legitimate expectations of the profession and society.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic engineering, how does rationalization impact professional conduct?", "answer": "Rationalization leads to unethical professional conduct by allowing individuals to justify their actions, avoid guilt feelings, and excuse themselves from making moral changes, as seen in Case Study 4 where a supervisor justifies falsifying a water quality report."}, {"question": "Why do professionals employ rationalizations to justify their actions in hydrology and water resources management?", "answer": "Professionals employ rationalizations to avoid guilt feelings and the scorn of others, and to provide self-justification for their actions, thereby excusing themselves from making changes in their moral decision process, as explained by Ross (1972)."}, {"question": "In the context of water quality reporting, what rationalization might a supervisor use to justify falsifying test results?", "answer": "A supervisor might rationalize that the test results are probably incorrect and that additional tests would prove the standards are being met, relying on their professional experience over laboratory tests, as seen in Case Study 4."}, {"question": "How does the rationalization that \"everybody is doing it\" affect an individual's moral decision process in hydrology and water resources science?", "answer": "This rationalization makes the individual feel less guilty by believing they are on the same moral level as others, leading them to not consider the value rights of others and enabling them to repeat unethical conduct, as it lowers the perceived need to rise to a higher level of ethical conduct."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic engineering projects, what are the implications of prioritizing personal needs or firm efficiency over professional integrity and societal values?", "answer": "Prioritizing personal needs or firm efficiency over professional integrity and societal values leads to unethical conduct, as seen in the case of the young engineer and the supervisor, where rationalizations serve to place selfish ends before the legitimate expectations of the profession and society, undermining trust, integrity, and the reputation of the profession. This can have long-term consequences on the credibility of hydrologic engineering projects and the trust of clients and the public. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of balancing individual and organizational interests with the ethical standards and values of the profession, ensuring that hydrologic engineering projects are conducted with integrity, transparency, and accountability."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging for professionals in hydrology and water resources science to balance personal needs with the ethical expectations of the profession and society?", "answer": "It is challenging because rationalizations can serve as a means to justify actions that prioritize personal needs or firm efficiency over professional integrity and societal values, making it difficult for individuals to recognize the ethical implications of their actions and to make decisions that align with the values of the profession and society. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that professionals may convince themselves that their actions are justified, as seen in the rationalizations provided by the young engineer, such as \"it is standard business practice\" or \"I am only doing what I am told to do.\" To overcome this challenge, professionals must be aware of their own biases and rationalizations, and actively seek to balance their personal needs with the ethical expectations of the profession and society."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic engineering, how does the value of truth impact professional conduct and decision-making?", "answer": "The value of truth is essential in hydrologic engineering, as it underlies the integrity of the profession and the trust of clients and the public. When professionals prioritize truth, they are more likely to make decisions that align with the ethical standards of the profession, even if it means going against personal interests or firm efficiency. However, when truth is compromised, as seen in the case of falsifying water quality reports, it can lead to unethical conduct and undermine the credibility of the profession. Therefore, professionals in hydrology and water resources science must prioritize truth and transparency in their work, recognizing its importance in maintaining the integrity and trust of the profession."}, {"question": "What are some common rationalizations that professionals in hydrology and water resources science might use to justify unethical conduct?", "answer": "Common rationalizations include \"everybody is doing it,\" \"if I don't do it, someone will,\" \"it is standard business practice,\" \"I am only doing what I am told to do,\" \"it is only a small amount of money,\" and \"it is the manager's responsibility to decide money matters.\" These rationalizations can serve as a means to justify actions that prioritize personal needs or firm efficiency over professional integrity and societal values, highlighting the importance of recognizing and challenging such rationalizations to maintain ethical conduct in the profession."}, {"question": "How does the concept of rationalization relate to the integrity of hydrologic engineering projects and the reputation of the profession?", "answer": "The concept of rationalization is closely related to the integrity of hydrologic engineering projects and the reputation of the profession, as it can lead to unethical conduct and compromise the trust of clients and the public.

{"paragraph": "1.12 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS Hydrologists do not work in a value vacuum, and it is unreasonable to believe that you will never be confronted by a value conflict in the workplace. If the appeals are handled properly, the ethical conflicts will usually be resolved without incident. The solution of more complex ethical conflicts requires a good understanding of the systematic process of Table 1-2 which is designed to give the optimum weight to the moral rights of all the parties involved. Reso- lution of ethical conflicts should not be viewed solely from the viewpoint of the effects on the individual. Just as the firm, the profession, and society have moral responsibilities, they have value rights that must be respected. Proper respect for these values is in the best interest of society as well as the individual, and the responsibilities are best met when a procedure such as that outlined in Table 1-2 is followed. Solutions to ethlcal dilemmas require knowledge of three aspects of ethical decision malung. First, the person involved must have an appreciation for human value issues and be Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 able to identify the values that are in conflict. Second, the person must recognize that the ef- fects of value conflicts extend beyond himself or herself. Value conflicts within the work- place impact on the firm, the profession, and society, not just the individual. The individual, the firm, the profession, and society have ethical responsibilities as well as ethical rights. Moral rights and responsibilities to each of these parties must be considered in finding the optimal solution to an ethical dilemma. Third, the person must know the steps to follow that will provide the optimum solution to an ethical dilemma. These steps are summarized in Table 1-2. The discussion in this chapter has tried to show that the hydrologist has both technical and value professional responsibilities, both of which require the hydrologist to show con- cern for the public. Whle I may have overtly ignored the employer, the hydrologist has a di- rect responsibility to the employer; ths responsibility goes beyond just fulfilling the techni- cal requirements of the job. Important employer-related responsibilities must be considered in decision malung. Before going beyond the firm to protest corporate actions, the hydrolo- gist should make every attempt to view the problem and the value issues from the perspec- tive of the employer. The professional reputation of both the firm and its other employees should be important to the hydrologist even when he or she disagrees with the employer's decision. The hydrologist should also respect the collective knowledge and experience of the managers of the fm. The hydrologist should recognize that the employer has a responsibil- ity to provide long-term employment for the employees of the firm. I personally know of many employers and managers in engineering firms who place high priority on the welfare of the employees and personally agonize over decisions to discharge employees because the funding is no longer there to support them. These are important value issues that increase the complexity of a decision to protest the action of an employer. The main point of this discussion is that hydrologic design requires more than just technical knowledge of the design methods. Human and societal values must be considered in the practice of hydrology. This should be quite evident from the four case studies pre- sented in Section 1.6.1. While the technical details are often very standardized, it is rarely possible to standardize the value issues. Value issues cannot be easily quantified and numeri- cally combined with quantifiable goals such as maximizing benefit-cost ratios. Our inability to quantify these value issues does not mean that we should not incorporate them into our de- cisions. They must be considered; otherwise, the hydrologist will be viewed as lacking a so- cial conscience. In the first case study of Section l .6.1, how can we quantify the increased risk to the health of the local citizens? In deciding on a course of action in the fourth case study, can the damage to the environment and the potential reduction in the aesthetical quali- ties of the riverine environment be quantified with the cost of cleanup? I have been asked on numerous occasions for advice on how to handle ethical dilem- mas. In the initial stage of one such problem, I discussed the issue with both parties and thought that I could resolve the issue. Therefore, I ignored Step IA1 of Table 1-2. Instead of malung notes after each of the discussions, I mistakenly assumed that the situation was being resolved. I made a written statement only after I was so instructed to do so by a lawyer who was approached by one of the parties. At that point I could not remember all of the details and left out what turned out to be some very important events. In retrospect, it may have hin- dered my ability to help the individual and resolve the issue. Thus, learn from my experi- ence. When a problem arises, no matter how minor it seems at the time, maintain a record of Problems 23 it. The details could prove to be very valuable at a later time. A tape recorder is a very effi- cient means of recording the details of events. However, whatever medium is used to record the information, make sure that it is placed in a secure environment. In summary, every student of hydrology must recognize that the study of hydrology is more than just developing skills related to the technical aspects of hydrologic design; the hy- drologist must also consider the social impact of a design. PROBLEMS Identify the processes of the hydrologic cycle that affect flood runoff from a 3-acre forested lot. Discuss the relative importance of each of the processes. If the lot is cleared, what changes in the processes and their importance will occur? If a single-family residence is constructed on the cleared lot, what processes will control flood runoff from the lot? If the drainage area of the site of Problem 1-1 is 50 acres and 150 residences are to be built, identify the processes of the hydrologic cycle that will affect flood runoff for the three water- shed states: forested, cleared, and developed. In each case, discuss the relative importance of the processes. If a 25-acre commercial shopping center was to be constructed at one end of a 50-acre water- shed, identify the processes of the hydrologic cycle that will affect flood runoff after develop- ment. Discuss the relative importance of the processes. Would you expect a 25-acre commercial shopping center to affect the flood runoff from a 500- acre watershed, assuming that the remainder of the watershed is forested? Discuss your re- sponses in terms of the hydrologic cycle. Identify the hydrologic processes that affect flood runoff from a 3000-ft section of interstate highway and the accompanying grass-covered right-of-way. Which processes are most impor- tant in determining the flood runoff from the site? A wet basement (for example, moisture on the floor and water seeping in through cracks in the wall and floor) is not an uncommon problem in single-family residential homes. From the standpoint of the hydrologic cycle, briefly discuss the problem and possible solutions. A single-family residential development lies down slope from a small suburban shopping center that has no facilities for controlling flood runoff. Several of the homes experience erosion of the lawns during moderate and large storm events. From the standpoint of the hydrologic cycle, briefly discuss the problem and possible solutions. For a circular pipe flowing full, the head loss (h,) can be computed using the Darcy-Weisbach equation: in which f is the dimensionless friction factor that is a function of the Reynolds number and pipe roughness, L and D are the length and diameter of the pipe, respectively, and V is the velocity of flow. A firm intends to develop a pipe made of a new ceramic material for which f values are not available. Discuss the task in terms of analysis and synthesis. 1-9. Design an experiment in which the efficiency of a pump at some specified Q could be deter- mined. Discuss the problem in terms of the concepts of analysis and synthesis. 24 Introduction to Hydrology Chap. 1 1-10. A storm with a uniform depth of 1 in. falls on a 25-acre watershed.

Use Table 1-2 to arrive at a recommended course of action. 1-17. The manager of a firm that performs hydrologic design work underbids on a contract in order to improve chances of being awarded the contract, knowing that he will later submit requests for contract \"add-ons\" with higher than reasonable budget amendments. 1-18. A hydrologist makes extensive personal use of the company's computer system without ap- proval or any expectation of reimbursing the firm. 1-19. A hydrologist, who is also a registered professional engineer, signs design work completed by unregistered subordinates without checking the work for accuracy. 1-20. A research hydrologist writes a paper that details personal research and submits the paper to two different professional journals without informing them of the dual submission. The paper is ac- cepted for publication and subsequently published in both journals. 1-21. A hydrologist, who serves as office manager for a large engineering firm, hires two new hydrol- ogists, one man and one woman; both are recent college graduates with no experience. While both show equal ability and effort, the manager continually gives the better assignments to the man and Limits the professional opportunities of the woman. Review Questions 25 1-22. A college professor, who has a full-time position teaching hydrology at a state university, spends almost all of her time at the firm where she serves as a consulting hydrologist. While she makes most of her classes, she greatly exceeds the university norm of \"one day per week of out- side consulting.\" 1-23. A hydrologist whose only professional experience is in surface water hydrology purchases a piece of computer software that can be used for solving problems in ground water hydrology. The hydrologist then uses the software while selling his services as a consulting ground water hydrologist. 1-24. For each of the cases in Problems 1-17 through 1-23, give a rationalization that the individual might use to justify the improper conduct. 1-25. Give three (or more) rationalizations used by students who cheat on examinations. For each ra- tionalization, show the irrationality of the reasoning. 1-26.

In some cases, a theoretical analysis is used to identify the input variables and the form of the underlying pre- diction equation, but the design method is made operational only after analyzing measured hydrologic data. Given the widespread use of data analysis techniques in hydrology, it is im- portant to be familiar with the data analysis methods used most frequently. Knowledge of data analysis methods is necessary in order to appreciate the limitations and accuracy of ex- isting hydrologic design methods that are the result of data analysis and to develop new hy- drologic design methods that require calibration to measured hydrologic data. For the objectives of this book it is only necessary for the reader to be knowledgeable about a few probability and statistical concepts. The methods discussed in this chapter are (1) probability concepts, (2) statistical moments, (3) hypothesis tests, and (4) regression analy- sis. A fifth statistical method, frequency analysis, is discussed in Chapter 5. Knowledge of these methods can provide a basic understanding of the potential limitations and accuracy of existing hydrologic methods, as well as the basis for developing new design methods. Thls chapter represents a significant departure from the general thrust of this book. Most of the remainder of the book deals with elements of the hydrologic cycle; this chapter deals with statistical methods. Given the importance of these methods to the development and understanding of hydrologic design and given the fact that these statistical methods are used in the development of the methods discussed in most of the other chapters, a general discussion of the statistical methods is provided here. Thus, we can concentrate on the hy- drologic concepts in the other chapters. STATISTICAL TERMINOLOGY Each year, considerable effort and resources are expended on the collection of hydrologic and meteorologic data. These data represent sample observations from a population. There are two key words here: sample and population. The set of past observations represents a sample from the population, not the population itself. It is important to understand that the sample is a random collection or subset of the population. As an example, we might set up an instrument to record the highest flood level during the year at a particular location along a stream reach. The largest observed flood for that year is an observation on a random variable because we can be assured that the annual peak flood will be different each year. If we obtain this measurement each year, then after n years we will have a sample size of n. The objective of the data analysis will be to use the sample to identify and draw inferences about the popu- lation. After the population has been estimated, the assumed population will be the basis for hydrologic designs. The population would consist of all values that could have been ob- served in the past and will occur in the future. Unfortunately, we cannot make measurements after the event has passed, nor can we measure events that have not yet occurred. We cannot know the population, and we have to use the sample to draw inferences about what will hap- pen in the future. Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 Before providing a more formal discussion of these statistical terms, it is important to point out the basis for much of statistical analysis. Statistical inference is concerned with methods that permit an investigator to make generalizations about populations using infor- mation obtained from random samples. That is, samples are subsets of the population. If knowledge of the population represents complete information, statistical analyses of sample data represent decision malung under conditions of incomplete information (for example, under conditions of uncertainty). Statistical methods are used for collecting, organizing, summarizing, and analyzing quantitative information.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design methods, why is data analysis necessary?", "answer": "Data analysis is necessary because many design methods are based partly on theoretical principles, but the development of almost all hydrologic design methods uses some form of data analysis to make the method operational. This involves analyzing measured hydrologic data to identify input variables and the form of the underlying prediction equation. The use of data analysis allows for the calibration of design methods to measured hydrologic data, which is essential for understanding the limitations and accuracy of existing hydrologic design methods and for developing new methods."}, {"question": "How do statistical methods contribute to the understanding of hydrologic design and the development of new design methods?", "answer": "Statistical methods contribute significantly to the understanding of hydrologic design by providing a basis for analyzing and interpreting hydrologic data. This includes methods such as probability concepts, statistical moments, hypothesis tests, and regression analysis, which help in understanding the potential limitations and accuracy of existing hydrologic methods. Furthermore, knowledge of these statistical methods is necessary for developing new hydrologic design methods that require calibration to measured hydrologic data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of hydrologic designs."}, {"question": "In hydrology, what is the distinction between a sample and a population, and why is this distinction important?", "answer": "In hydrology, a sample represents a subset of observations from a larger population. The population consists of all possible values that could have been observed in the past and will occur in the future. This distinction is crucial because hydrologic designs are based on inferences drawn from sample data about the population. Understanding this distinction is essential for appreciating the limitations and uncertainties associated with using sample data to make predictions about future hydrologic events."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to estimate the population in hydrology, and what implications does this have for hydrologic design?", "answer": "Estimating the population in hydrology is challenging because it consists of all values that could have been observed in the past and will occur in the future, which is inherently unknowable. This challenge implies that hydrologic designs must be based on inferences drawn from sample data, which introduces uncertainty. As a result, hydrologic designs must account for this uncertainty, and statistical methods play a critical role in quantifying and managing this uncertainty to ensure the reliability and accuracy of hydrologic designs."}, {"question": "How does statistical inference enable generalizations about populations in hydrology?", "answer": "Statistical inference in hydrology enables generalizations about populations by using information obtained from random samples. This involves analyzing sample data to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the population, such as its mean, variance, and distribution. By doing so, statistical inference provides a systematic approach to making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, which is inherent in hydrologic design due to the complexity and variability of hydrologic systems."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic data analysis, what role do probability concepts play, and why are they important?", "answer": "Probability concepts play a crucial role in hydrologic data analysis by providing a framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty. They are important because hydrologic events, such as floods and droughts, are inherently probabilistic, meaning their occurrence and magnitude can be predicted only in terms of probability. Understanding probability concepts is essential for developing and applying hydrologic design methods that can accurately predict the likelihood and potential impacts of such events."}, {"question": "How do regression analysis and hypothesis testing contribute to the development of hydrologic design methods?", "answer": "Regression analysis and hypothesis testing contribute to the development of hydrologic design methods by providing tools for analyzing relationships between variables and testing hypotheses about these relationships. Regression analysis helps in identifying the form of the underlying prediction equation and the input variables, while hypothesis testing allows for the evaluation of the significance of these relationships. This enables the development of more accurate and reliable hydrologic design methods that are grounded in empirical evidence."}, {"question": "What is the significance of understanding statistical terminology in hydrology, and how does it impact hydrologic design?", "answer": "Understanding statistical terminology in hydrology is significant because it provides a common language and framework for analyzing and interpreting hydrologic data. This understanding is crucial for hydrologic design as it enables the accurate interpretation of data, the identification of limitations and uncertainties, and the development of reliable design methods. Furthermore, it facilitates communication among hydrologists and engineers, ensuring that designs are based on a shared understanding of the underlying statistical concepts and methods."}, {"question": "In hydrology, why is it essential to consider the concept of uncertainty, and how do statistical methods address this issue?", "answer": "Considering uncertainty is essential in hydrology because hydrologic systems are complex and variable, making predictions inherently uncertain. Statistical methods address this issue by providing tools for quantifying and managing uncertainty. For example, statistical methods can estimate the probability of extreme events, such as floods, and provide confidence intervals for predictions, thereby allowing hydrologists to design systems that can accommodate a range of possible outcomes and minimize the risk of failure."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.2.1 Probability Probability is a scale of measurement that is used to describe the likelihood of an event where an event is defined as the occurrence of a specified value of the random variable. The scale on which probability is measured extends from 0 to 1, inclusive, where a value of 1 in- dicates a certainty of occurrence of the event and a value of 0 indicates a certainty of failure to occur or nonoccurrence of the event. Quite often, probability is specified as a percentage; for example, when the weatherperson indicates that there is a 30% chance of rain, past expe- rience indicates that under similar meteorological conditions it has rained 3 out of 10 times. In this example, the probability was estimated empirically using the concept of relative frequency: in which n is the number of observations on the random variable x that result in outcome x,, and N is the total number of observations on x. As an example, consider the case of the design of a coffer dam around the site where a bridge pier is being constructed. The height to which the coffer dam is constructed depends, in part, on the level of flooding that can be expected during the period of construction. For example, we will assume that construction of the bridge pier will take one year. Let's assume that we have a flood record at the site consisting of the largest flood event in each of the last 10 years. Let's also assume that a benefit-cost analysis suggests that we should set the height of the coffer dam so that there is only a 10% chance that the flood level will exceed the height of the coffer dam during the 1-yr period of construction. Using Equation 2-1 we know the probability, p(x = x,) = 0.10, and N = 10; therefore, in the sample of 10 we would want to set the height of the coffer dam so that only 1 of 10 measured peak discharges will exceed the height of the coffer dam. Thus we would set the height of the dam at some point between the largest and second largest of the ten floods of record. In this simplified example, we have used sample information to draw inferences about the population. Since we are uncertain about what will occur in the future, we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Hydrologists and engineers must make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. For example, engineers who have the responsibility of monitoring the quality of water in streams and bodies of water estimate pollution levels using samples collected from the water. The samples are then analyzed in a laboratory and the results are used to make a decision. Many water quality sampling programs involve ten or fewer measurements. Uncertainty arises be- cause of the highly variable nature of pollution; that is, the concentration of a pollutant may Set. 2.2 Statistical Terminology 31 vary with time, the degree of turbulence in the water, and the magnitude of and the frequency with which wastes are discharged into the water. These sources of variation must be ac- counted for when the engineer makes a decision about water quality.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of probability in hydrology, what scale is used to measure the likelihood of an event?", "answer": "The scale on which probability is measured extends from 0 to 1, inclusive, where a value of 1 indicates a certainty of occurrence of the event and a value of 0 indicates a certainty of failure to occur or nonoccurrence of the event."}, {"question": "How is probability often specified in everyday language, and what does it imply?", "answer": "Probability is often specified as a percentage, implying the relative frequency of an event's occurrence under similar conditions, such as a 30% chance of rain indicating it has rained 3 out of 10 times under similar meteorological conditions."}, {"question": "In the design of a coffer dam, why is the height of the dam set based on the level of flooding that can be expected during construction?", "answer": "The height of the coffer dam is set based on the level of flooding that can be expected during construction because it depends on the level of flooding, and a benefit-cost analysis suggests setting the height so that there is only a certain percentage chance (e.g., 10%) that the flood level will exceed the height of the coffer dam during the construction period. This decision-making process under uncertainty is crucial for hydrologists and engineers. For instance, in the example given, the height of the coffer dam would be set so that only 1 of 10 measured peak discharges will exceed the height of the coffer dam, thus minimizing the risk of flooding during construction."}, {"question": "What sources of variation must be accounted for when making decisions about water quality, and why are they significant?", "answer": "The sources of variation that must be accounted for when making decisions about water quality include the highly variable nature of pollution, such as the concentration of a pollutant varying with time, the degree of turbulence in the water, and the magnitude and frequency of waste discharge into the water. These sources are significant because they introduce uncertainty into the decision-making process, especially when water quality sampling programs involve ten or fewer measurements, making it challenging for engineers to accurately estimate pollution levels and make informed decisions. The variability in pollution levels can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly accounted for, highlighting the need for careful consideration of these factors in water quality assessment."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological decision-making, how do hydrologists and engineers make decisions under conditions of uncertainty?", "answer": "Hydrologists and engineers make decisions under conditions of uncertainty by using sample information to draw inferences about the population, as seen in the example of setting the height of a coffer dam based on a flood record. This involves analyzing available data, such as the largest flood event in each of the last 10 years, and applying statistical concepts like probability to estimate the likelihood of future events. The process requires balancing the need for accuracy with the limitations of available data, making it essential to understand the underlying statistical terminology and concepts to make informed decisions."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the concept of relative frequency in estimating probabilities in hydrology?", "answer": "The concept of relative frequency is essential in estimating probabilities in hydrology because it allows for the empirical estimation of probabilities based on past observations. By analyzing the number of observations that result in a specific outcome (n) out of the total number of observations (N), hydrologists can estimate the probability of future events, such as the likelihood of a flood exceeding a certain level. This approach is particularly useful in hydrology, where historical data can provide valuable insights into future probabilities, enabling more accurate decision-making."}, {"question": "In what ways do engineers estimate pollution levels in water bodies, and what challenges do they face in this process?", "answer": "Engineers estimate pollution levels in water bodies by collecting samples from the water, analyzing them in a laboratory, and using the results to make decisions. However, they face challenges due to the highly variable nature of pollution, which can lead to uncertainty in their estimates. The concentration of pollutants can vary significantly with time, water turbulence, and the magnitude and frequency of waste discharge, making it difficult to obtain accurate representations of water quality with limited measurements. This variability underscores the importance of careful sampling strategies and robust analytical methods to ensure reliable estimates of pollution levels."}, {"question": "How does the design of a coffer dam illustrate the application of probability in hydrological engineering?", "answer": "The design of a coffer dam illustrates the application of probability in hydrological engineering by demonstrating how probability is used to make decisions under uncertainty. In this case, the height of the coffer dam is set so that there is only a 10% chance that the flood level will exceed it during the construction period, based on a benefit-cost analysis and historical flood data. This application of probability allows engineers to balance the risk of flooding with the cost of constructing a higher dam, showcasing the practical use of statistical concepts in hydrological decision"}]}
{"paragraph": "2.2.2 Random Variables Two types of random variables must be considered. First, a discrete random variable is one that may only take on distinct, usually integer, values; for example, the outcome of a roll of a die may only take on the integer values from 1 to 6 and is therefore a discrete random vari- able. If we define a random variable to be whether or not a river has overflowed its banks in any one year, then the variable is discrete because only discrete outcomes are possible; the out-of-bank flood occurred or it did not occur in any one year. Second, the outcome of an event may take on any value within a continuum of values; such a random variable is called continuous. For example, the average of all scores on a test having a maximum possible score of 100 may take on any value, including nonintegers, be- tween 0 and 100; thus the class average would be a continuous random variable. The volume of rainfall occurring during storm events is an example of a continuous random variable be- cause it can be any value on a continuous scale from 0 inches to some very large value. A distinction is made between discrete and continuous random variables, because the computa- tion of probabilities is different for the two types.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrological events, what types of random variables are considered?", "answer": "Two types of random variables are considered: discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables take on distinct, usually integer values, while continuous random variables can take on any value within a continuum of values."}, {"question": "Why is the computation of probabilities different for discrete and continuous random variables?", "answer": "The computation of probabilities is different for discrete and continuous random variables because the nature of their possible outcomes differs. Discrete variables have distinct outcomes, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a flood, which can be counted and assigned probabilities directly. In contrast, continuous variables, like the volume of rainfall, can take on any value within a range, requiring a different approach to calculate probabilities, often involving intervals or distributions."}, {"question": "How does the classification of a random variable as discrete or continuous impact the analysis of hydrological phenomena?", "answer": "The classification of a random variable as discrete or continuous significantly impacts the analysis of hydrological phenomena. For discrete variables, such as whether a river has overflowed its banks, the analysis focuses on the probability of the event occurring or not, which can be crucial for flood risk assessment and management. For continuous variables, like rainfall volume, understanding the distribution and probability of different values is essential for predicting and managing water resources, including reservoir operations and water supply planning. This distinction is critical because it influences the choice of statistical methods and models used in hydrological analysis."}, {"question": "In the context of water resources management, what is an example of a continuous random variable?", "answer": "An example of a continuous random variable in the context of water resources management is the volume of rainfall occurring during storm events. This variable can take on any value on a continuous scale from 0 inches to a very large value, making it a continuous random variable."}, {"question": "Why is it important to distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables in hydrology?", "answer": "Distinguishing between discrete and continuous random variables is important in hydrology because it affects the computation of probabilities and the choice of analytical methods.

For continuous variables, predictions could involve forecasting the magnitude or distribution of values, such as the amount of rainfall expected during a storm. This distinction is vital for developing accurate predictive models that can support informed decision-making in water resources management."}, {"question": "Why are continuous random variables, like rainfall volume, challenging to predict in hydrology?", "answer": "Continuous random variables, like rainfall volume, are challenging to predict in hydrology because they can take on any value within a wide range, and their distribution is often complex. Predicting the exact volume of rainfall during a storm event involves understanding a multitude of factors, including atmospheric conditions, topography, and climate patterns, which can interact in complex ways. This complexity, combined with the inherent variability of continuous random variables, makes accurate prediction challenging, requiring sophisticated models and data analysis techniques."}, {"question": "How does understanding the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) aid in the development of hydrological models?", "answer": "Understanding the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) aids in the development of hydrological models by guiding the selection of appropriate mathematical and statistical frameworks. For discrete variables, models might be based on probability theory and discrete distributions, whereas for continuous variables, models could incorporate continuous distributions and regression analysis. This understanding ensures that the models are tailored to the nature of the data, enhancing their accuracy and reliability in predicting hydrological phenomena. Furthermore, recognizing the distinction between discrete and continuous variables facilitates the integration of different types of data and models, leading to more comprehensive and effective hydrological modeling."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.2.3 Probability for Discrete Random Variables The probability of a discrete random variable is given by a mass function. A massfunction specifies the probability that the discrete random variable x equals the value xk and is denoted by P ( x ~ =) P(X = xk) (2-2) Probability has two important boundary conditions. First, the probability of an event xk must be less than or equal to 1, and second, it must be greater than or equal to zero: This property is valid for all possible values of k.

Specifically, the probability that a continuous random variable takes on a specific value equals 0; that is, probabilities for con- tinuous random variables must be defined over an interval. Discrete random variables can take on a specific value so it will have a non-zero probability. It is also important to note that the integral of the PDF from -co to co equals 1: Also, because of Equation 2-9, the following is valid: The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a continuous random variable is de- fined by 5 in which is the dummy argument of integration. The CDF is a nondecreasing function in that p(x I x,) I p(x I x,) when x, I x,. The CDF equals 0 at -co and 1 at a. Example 2-1 Assume that the probability distribution of evaporation Eon any day during the year is given by 4 0 S E S 0.25 in./day 0 otherwise To show that this is a legitimate PDF, Equation 2-9 gives Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 The probability that E is between 0.1 and 0.2 in./day can be found by integration: The cumulative function F(E) defines the probability that E is less than or equal to some value X: Thus the probability that E is less than 0.15 in./day is F(0.15) = 0.6. The probability that E is be- tween 0.1 and 0.2 in./day is F(0.2)- F(O. 1) = 0.8 - 0.4, which is the same probability derived by integrating the density function f(E). The probability that E is greater than X is given by 1 - F(E);f or example, the probability that E is greater than 0.05 in./day is MOMENTS OF A SAMPLE OR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION Whether summarizing a data set or attempting to find the population, one must characterize the sample. Moments are useful descriptors of data; for example, the mean, which is a mo- ment, is an important characteristic of a set of observations on a random variable, such as rainfall volume or the concentration of a water pollutant. A moment can be referenced to any point on the measurement axis; however, the origin (for example, zero point) and the mean are the two most common reference points. Although most data analyses use only two moments, in some statistical studies it is im- portant to examine three moments: 1. The mean is the first moment of values measured about the origin. 2. The variance is the second moment of values measured about the mean. 3. The skew is the third moment of values measured about the mean. The moments can be computed using the equations that follow. For a continuous ran- dom variable x, the kth moment about the origin is given by in which x is the random variable andflx) is its density function. The corresponding equation for a discrete random variable is in which n is the number of elements in the sample andflx) is the mass function.

Although the mean conveys certain information about either a sample or population, it does not completely characterize a random variable. The distributions shown in Figure 2-3 are obviously not identical, even though they have the same mean. The probability mass function of Figure 2-lc can be used to illustrate the use of Equa- tion 2-17 to compute the mean for a discrete random variable such as the number of floods X in a 10-yr period: Thus the mean number of floods in a 10-yr period is 5; however, Figure 2-lc shows that in any 10-yr period, any number of floods from 0 to 10 may occur.

{"paragraph": "2.4.1 Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution is used to define probabilities of discrete events. It is applicable to random variables that satisfy the following four assumptions: 1. There are n occurrences, or trials, of the random variable. 2. The n trials are independent. 3. There are only two possible outcomes for each trial. 4. The probability of each outcome is constant from trial to trial. The probabilities of occurrence of any random variable satisfying these four assumptions can be computed using the binomial distribution. For example, in flipping a coin n times, the n trials are independent, there are only two possible outcomes (one must assume that the coin will not stand on edge), and the probability of a head remains 0.5; thus the probability of get- ting three heads, or no heads, in five tosses could be computed using the binomial distribu- tion. One could not use the binomial distribution to compute probabilities for the toss of a die because there are six possible outcomes; however, the four assumptions would apply if one defines the two outcomes as either an even or an odd number of dots. We can denote the two outcomes of a binomial process as A and B, with the probability of A equal top and the probability of B occumng equal to (1 - p), which we can denote as q (that is, q = 1 - p). If we let x be the number of occurrences of A, then B occurs (n - x) times in n trials. One possible sequence would be Since the trials are independent, the probability of this sequence is the product of the proba- bilities of the n outcomes: which is equal to But many other possible sequences of the outcomes could occur; for example: It would be easy to show that the probability of this sequence occumng is also given by Equation 2-27. In fact, any sequence involving x occurrences of A and (n - x) occurrences of B would have the probability given by Equation 2-27. Thus, it is only necessary to determine how many different sequences of x occurrences of A and (n - x) occurrences of B are possi- ble. It can be shown that the number of occurrences is Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 x! (n - x)! where n! is read \"n factorial\" and equals The factorial O! is defined as 1. Computationally, the value of Equation 2-28 can be found from The quantity given by Equation 2-28 is computed so frequently that it is often abbreviated as (,\") and called the binomial coefficient. It represents the number of ways that sequences in- volving events A and B can occur with x occurrences of A and (n x) occurrences of B. Com- - bining Equations 2-27 and 2-28, we get the probability of getting exactly x occurrences of A in n trials, given that the probability of event A occurring on any trial is p: (i p ) x( l - p)\"-\" for x = 0,1,2, ..., n (2-3 1) This is a binomial probability, and the probabilities defined by Equation 2-31 represent the distribution of binomial probabilities. It is often denoted as b(x; n, p), which is read, \"the probability of getting exactly x occurrences of a random variable in n trials when the proba- bility of the event occurring on any one trial is p.\" For example, if n = 4 and x = 2, Equation 2-28 would suggest six possible sequences: The six possible sequences are (AABB), (ABAB), (ABBA), (BAAB), (BABA), and (BBAA). Thus if the probability of A occurring on any one trial is 0.3, then the probability of exactly two occurrences in four trials is Similarly, if p equals 0.5, the probability of getting exactly two occurrences of event A would be It is easy to show that for four trials there is only one way of getting either zero or four occur- rences of A, there are four ways of getting either one or three occurrences of A, and there are six ways of getting two occurrences of A. Thus with a total of sixteen possible outcomes, the value given by Equation 2-32 for the number of ways of getting two occurrences divided by the total of sixteen possible outcomes supports the computed probability of Equation 2-34. Example 2-4 A coffer dam is to be built on a river bank so that a bridge pier can be built. The dam is designed to prevent flow from the river from interfering with the construction of the pier. The cost of the dam is related to the height of the dam; as the height increases, the cost increases. But as the Sez. 2.4 Distribution Functions 43 height is increased, the potential for flood damage decreases. The level of flow in the stream varies weekly and can be considered as a random variable. However, the design engineer is in- terested only in two states, the overtopping of the dam during a one-workweek period or non- overtopping. If construction of the pier is to require two years for completion, the time period consists of 104 independent \"trials.\" If the probability of the flood that would cause overtopping remains constant @), the problem satisfies the four assumptions required to use the binomial dis- tribution for computing probabilities. If x is defined as an occurrence of overtopping and the height of the dam is such that the probability of overtopping during any 1-week period is 0.05, then for a 104-week period (n = 104) the probability that the dam will not be overtopped (x = 0) is computed using Equation 2-3 1: p (no overtopping) = b(0; 104, 0.05) The probability of exactly one overtopping is Thus the probability of more than one overtopping is The probability of the dam not being overtopped can be increased by increasing the height of the dam. If the height of the dam is increased so that the probability of overtopping in a 1-week pe- riod is decreased to 0.02, the probability of no overtoppings increases to p (no overtoppings) = b(0; 104, 0.02) (2-38) = (0.02)\" (0.98)'04 = 0.1223 Thus the probability of no overtopping during the 104-week period increased 25 times when the probability of overtopping during one week was decreased from 0.05 to 0.02.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrological engineering, how does the binomial distribution apply to the design of a coffer dam to prevent flood damage during bridge pier construction?", "answer": "The binomial distribution applies by modeling the probability of overtopping or non-overtopping of the dam during each week as a random variable with two outcomes, allowing engineers to compute probabilities of different scenarios over a period of time, such as the probability of no overtopping or exactly one overtopping during the construction period.

{"paragraph": "2.4.2 Normal Distribution The most frequently used density function is the normal or Gaussian distribution, whch is a symmetric distribution with a bell-shaped appearance.

Because there are an infinite number of possible values of p and a. there are an infinite number of possible configurations of the normal distribution. The cumulative distribution function for the nor- mal distribution can be determined by integrating Equation 2-39. Because of the extensive use of the normal distribution and the infinite number of pos- sible values of p and a, probabilities for a normal curve are usually evaluated using the stan- dard normal distribution. The standard normal distribution is derived by transforming the random variable x to the random variable z using the following equation: 44 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 In practice, the sample moments Y and S may be used in place of CL and a in Equation 2-40.

{"paragraph": "2.5 HYPOTHESIS TESTING In problems of hydrologic analysis, it is frequently desirable to make a statistical test of some hypothesis. Specifically, we may want to use sample data to draw inferences about the un- derlying population. Decisions should be made with the population parameters, not the sam- ple statistics. Where the population parameter is computed from sample information, a statis- tical hypothesis test may be made to provide verification of some hypothesis. For example, water quality laws may require the mean concentration of a pollutant to be below some water quality standard. A sample of five may be taken from either a river or a well and the mean value computed. All five values will not be the same, with the variation in the five values re- flecting the uncertainty associated with samples; this constitutes decision making under con- ditions of uncertainty. We cannot automatically conclude that the water does not meet the state water standard just because the mean of the sample of five measurements is greater than the standard. Our decision must take the sample variation into account. A statistical hypothe- sis test of the mean would be the appropriate test for such decisions. Other types of hydrologic decisions require other statistical tests, including tests on a single mean, two means, groups of means, a single variance, two variances, and groups of variances.

{"paragraph": "2.5.1 Steps of a Hypothesis Test The following six steps can be used to perform a statistical analysis of a hypothesis: 1. Formulate hypotheses expressed using population descriptors. 2. Select the appropriate statistical model (theorem) that identifies the test statistic. 3. Specify the level of significance, which is a measure of risk. 4. Collect a data sample and compute the test statistic. 5. Find the critical value of the test statistic and define the region of rejection. 6. Make a decision by selecting the appropriate hypothesis. Each of these six steps is dscussed in more detail in the following paragraphs and then illus- trated with an example. Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 Step 1: Formulation of Hypotheses. Hypothesis testing represents a class of statistical techniques that are designed to extrapolate information from samples of data to make infer- ences about populations. The first step is to formulate two or more hypotheses for testing. The hypotheses will depend on the problem under investigation. Specifically, if the objective is to make inferences about a single population, the hypotheses will usually be statements in- dicating that a random variable has a specific probability distribution or that a population pa- rameter has some specific value. If the objective is to compare two or more specific parame- ters, such as the means of two populations, the hypotheses will be statements formulated to indicate the absence or presence of differences. It is important to note that the hypotheses are composed of statements involving either population distributions or population parameters; hypotheses should not be expressed in terms of sample statistics. The first hypothesis is called the null hypothesis, is denoted by Ho, and is always for- mulated to indicate that a difference does not exist; that is, Ho is expressed as an equality. The second hypothesis, which is called the alternative hypothesis, is formulated to indicate that a difference does exist; thus, it indicates an inequality. The alternative hypothesis is de- noted by either H, or HA. The null and alternative hypotheses should be expressed both grammatically and in mathematical terms and should represent mutually exclusive condi- tions. Thus when a statistical analysis of sampled data suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected, the alternative hypothesis must be accepted. Step 2: The Test Statistic and its Sampling Distribution. The alternative hypothesis of Step 1 provides for a difference between specified populations or parameters. To test the hypotheses of Step 1, it is necessary to develop a test statistic that reflects the difference suggested by the alternative hypothesis. The value of a test statistic will vary from one Sam- ple to the next. Therefore, the test statistic will be a random variable and have a sampling distribution. A hypothesis test should be based on a theoretical model that defines the prob- ability distribution function of the test statistic and the parameters of the distribution. Based on the distribution of the test statistic, probability statements about computed values may be made. Theoretical models are available for all of the more frequently used hypothesis tests. In cases where theoretical models are not available, empirical approximations have usually been developed. In any case, a model or theorem that specifies the test statistic, its distribu- tion, and its parameters must be identified. The test statistic reflects the hypotheses and the data that are usually available. Also, the test statistic is a random variable, and thus it has a distribution function that is defined by a functional form and one or more parameters. It is important to remember that more than one random variable is involved. For example, if we are dealing with a random variable x and are interested in testing a hypothesis about the mean of x, there are three random variables involved in the analysis: x, the mean of x, and the test statistic; each of these are random variables and each has a different probability distribu- tion. Step 3: The Level of Significance. A set of hypotheses were formulated in Step 1. In Step 2, a test statistic and its distribution were identified to reflect the problem for which the hypotheses were formulated. In Step 4, data will be collected to test the hypotheses. There- fore, before the data are collected, it is necessary to provide a probabilistic framework for ac- cepting or rejecting the null hypothesis and, subsequently, making a decision; the framework Sec. 2.5 Hypothesis Testing 53 will reflect the allowance to be made for the chance variation that can be expected in a sam- ple of data. Table 2 4 s hows the available situations and the potential decisions involved in a hy- pothesis test. The decision table suggests two types of error: Type I Error: Reject Ho when, in fact, Ho is true. Type I1 Error: Accept Ho when, in fact, Ho is false. These two types of incorrect decisions are not independent; however, the decision process is most often discussed with reference to only one of the decisions. The level of significance, which is a primary element of the decision process in hy- pothesis testing, represents the probability of making a Type I error and is denoted by the Greek lowercase letter alpha, a . The probability of a Type II error is denoted by the Greek lowercase letter beta, p. The two possible incorrect decisions are not independent. The level of significance should not be made exceptionally small, because the probability of making a Type I1 error will then increase. Selection of the level of significance should, therefore, be based on a rational analysis of the effect on decisions and should be selected prior to the col- lection and analysis of the sample data (for example, before Step 4). Specifically, one would expect the level of significance to be different when considering a case involving the loss of human life than when the case involves minor property damage. However, the value chosen for a is often based on convention and the availability of statistical tables, with values for a of 0.05 and 0.01 being selected frequently. However, the implications of this traditional means of specifying a should be understood. Because a and p are not independent of each other, it is necessary to consider the im- plications of both types of errors in selecting a level of significance. The concept of the power of a statistical test is important when discussing a Type 11 error. The power is defined as the probability of rejecting Ho when, in fact, it is false: power = 1 - p (245 The concept of the power of a test will not be discussed in more detail here; the reader should consult statistical texts for a more complete discussion of the relationship between a , p, and n. TABLE 2-4 Decision Table for Hypothesis Testing Situation Decision Ho is true Ho is false Accept Ho Correct decision Incorrect decision: type I1 error Reject Ho Incorrect decision: Correct decision type I1 error Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 Step 4: Data Analysis. Given CY and P, it is possible to determine the sample size re- quired to meet any rejection criterion. After obtaining the necessary data, the sample is used to provide an estimate of the test statistic. In most cases, the data are also used to provide es- timates of other parameters, such as the degrees of freedom, required to define the sampling distribution of the test statistic. Step 5: The Region ofRejection. The region of rejection consists of those values of the test statistic that would be unlikely to occur in a sample when the null hypothesis is, in fact, true. Conversely, the region of acceptance consists of those values of the test statistic that can be expected when the null hypothesis is, in fact, true. Extreme values of the test statistic are least likely to occur when the null hypothesis is true. Thus the region of rejection is usu- ally represented by one or both tails of the distribution of the test statistic. The critical value of the test statistic is defined as the value that separates the region of rejection from the region of acceptance. The critical value of the test statistic depends on (1) the statement of the alternative hypothesis, (2) the distribution of the test statistic, (3) the level of significance, and (4) characteristics of the sample of data. These four components represent the first four steps of a hypothesis test. Depending on the statement of the alternative hypothesis, the region of rejection may consist of values associated with either one or both tails of the distribution of the test statis- tic. This may best be illustrated with examples. Consider the case of a manufacturer of cold drinks. It must be recognized that the accuracy of the bottling process is not sufficient to as- sure that every bottle will contain exactly 12 oz. Some bottles will contain less, whereas oth- ers will contain more. If the label on the bottle indicates that the bottle contains 12 oz. the Sampling distribution S Sampling distribution of the test statistic S acceptance acceptance FIGURE 2-5 Representation of the region of rejection (crosshatched area), region of acceptance, and the critical value (S,): (a) HA:k # ko;( b) HA:p < kO(;c ) HA:k > po. Sec. 2.5 Hypothesis Testing 55 manufacturer wants to be assured that, on the average, each bottle contains at least that amount; otherwise, the manufacturer may be subject to a lawsuit for false advertising. But if the bottles contain, on the average, more than 12 oz, then the manufacturer may be losing money. Thus the manufacturer is interested in both extremely large and extremely small de- viations from 12 oz and would be interested in a two-tailed test: where p is the population mean and pOis the standard of comparison (for example, 12 oz). In this case, the region of rejection will consist of values in both tails. This is illustrated in Fig- ure 2-5a. In other cases, the region of rejection may consist of values in only one tail of the dis- tribution. For example, if the mean dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration from ten samples is used as an indicator of water quality, the regulatory agency would only be interested in whether or not the state water quality standard for dissolved oxygen is being met. Specifi- cally, if a manufacturing plant is discharging waste that contains a pollutant, the state may fine the manufacturer or close down the plant if the effluent causes the DO level to go below the standard. Thus the regulatory agency is only interested in whether or not the quality is less than the standard limit. It is not concerned with the degree to which the standard is ex- ceeded since levels of DO that are higher than the standard are not considered to be undesir- able. This situation represents a one-tailed hypothesis test because the alternative hypothesis is directional. The following hypotheses reflect this problem: In this case, the region of rejection is associated with values in only one tail of the distribu- tion, as illustrated in Figure 2-5b. Although the region of rejection should be defined in terms of values of the test statis- tic, it is often pictorially associated with an area of the sampling distribution that is equal to the level of significance. The region of rejection, region of acceptance, and the critical value are shown in Figure 2-5 for both two-tailed and one-tailed tests. Step 6: Select the Appropriate Hypothesis. A decision on whether or not to accept the null hypothesis depends on a comparison of the computed value of the test statistic and the critical value. The null hypothesis is rejected when the computed value lies in the region of rejection. Rejection of the null hypothesis implies acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. When a computed value of the test statistic lies in the region of rejection, there are two possi- ble explanations. First, the sampling procedure may have resulted in an extreme value purely by chance; although this a very unlikely event, this corresponds to the Type I error of Table 2 4 . Because the probability of this event is relatively small, this explanation is most often rejected. Second, the extreme value of the test statistic may have occurred because the null hypothesis is false; this is the explanation most often accepted and forms the basis for statis- tical inference. 56 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hypothesis testing in hydrology, what are the primary steps involved in performing a statistical analysis of a hypothesis?", "answer": "The primary steps involved in performing a statistical analysis of a hypothesis include formulating hypotheses, selecting the appropriate statistical model, specifying the level of significance, collecting a data sample and computing the test statistic, finding the critical value of the test statistic and defining the region of rejection, and making a decision by selecting the appropriate hypothesis."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the level of significance in hypothesis testing, and how does it relate to Type I and Type II errors?", "answer": "The level of significance is crucial in hypothesis testing because it represents the probability of making a Type I error, which is the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is true.

When a statistical analysis suggests rejecting the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis must be accepted. Expressing hypotheses in terms of population parameters ensures that the hypotheses are about the underlying population characteristics, which is the ultimate goal of inference in hydrological studies, rather than just the characteristics of a specific sample.

The power of a test is an important concept when discussing Type II errors because it reflects the ability of the test to detect a difference or effect when it exists. A test with high power is more likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false,"}]}
{"paragraph": "2.5.2 Summary of Common Hypothesis Tests It would not be possible to summarize all of the hypothesis tests that are available; in fact, if an entire textbook were written that did nothing more than summarize the available hypothe- sis tests, the book would be very large. Instead, a few of the more frequently used tests will be listed here just to show that all tests follow the same six steps and that it is not difficult to apply these tests. Table 2-5 provides a summary of frequently used tests. The table identifies the statistical characteristic involved, the null hypothesis for each test, the alternative hypoth- esis or hypotheses if more than one alternative is possible, the test statistic, and the decision criterion. The tests that are summarized in Table 2-5 are as follows: (1) The test of a single mean with o known, which is sometimes referred to as the z test (2) The test of a single mean with o unknown, which is sometimes referred to as the t test (3) The test of two means with the random variables having identical population variances which are not known (4) The test of a single variance to some standard value oi (5) The chi-square goodness-of-fit test for the probability distribution of a random variable x.

First, for sample sizes greater than 30, the z test can be used in place of the t test with little loss of accuracy. Second, the crit- ical values for the tests using the t and chi-square statistics can be obtained from Tables 2-6 and 2-7, respectively. In these tables, the critical value is obtained by entering the table with the degrees of freedom (v) on the left-hand margin and the probability argument (a, 1 - a, d 2 , or 1 - d 2 ) along the top of the table. Third, except for the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, all of the tests can be applied as either one-sided or two-sided tests. The chi-square goodness-of- fit test is always one-sided with the region of rejection in the upper tail of the dstribution. X2 Fourth, to apply the chi-square test the sample values of the random variable x are separated into k cells and the observed number of values (0,)i n each cell i is determined. The expected number of values (E,) is computed from the probability function identified in the null hypothe- sis. Each value of Eis hould be at least 5; therefore, the test requires a moderate-size sample. TABLE 2-6 Critical Values of the t Distribution 58 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 TABLE 2-7 Critical Values of the Chi-Square Distribution Example 2-6 Table 2-8 lists the monthly precipitation as a depth in inches for the Wildcat Creek near Lawrenceville, Georgia, for June, July, and August from 1954 to 1971. The monthly means and standard deviations are also shown in Table 2-8. From these data, can we conclude that the mean precipitation for July is 5 in.? Even though the sample mean of 4.5 1 in. is less than the hy- pothesized population mean of 5 in., the monthly precipitation exceeded 5 in. in 7 of the 18 years. Thus it is reasonable to test the one-sided alternative hypothesis: Since the standard deviation of the population, s, is not known, the t test should be used. In this case, the sample value of the test statistic is Set. 2.5 Hypothesis Testing TABLE 2-8 Monthly Precipitation (in.) for Wildcat Creek near Lawrenceville, Georgia Year June July August 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 Mean Std. dev. Since the sample size equals 18, the t distribution has 17 degrees of freedom. Using Table 2-6 with a level of significance of 5% (chosen by convention) the critical t value is -1.74. Since the computed t is not less than the critical value, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, the computed value lies in the region of acceptance rather than the region of rejection. This con- clusion states only that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean is significantly less than 5 in. While the null hypothesis states that the population mean equals 5 in., the statistical test certainly does not imply that the true mean is exactly 5 in. It only implies that we cannot conclude that the population mean is significantly less than 5 in. Example 2-7 If prior to organizing the data of Table 2-8, one wished to test the hypothesis that the mean monthly precipitations for July and August were equal, the following hypotheses could be stated: In this case, the two-sided alternative is selected because our interest is not directional. It is im- portant to note that it would be inappropriate to test the one-sided alternative that p, < after the data had been examined because then the sample data would be dictating the experimental Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 test. To compare the two means, the appropriate test statistic of Table 2-5 is used. The best esti- mate to the sample variance is + (18 - 1) (2.18)2 (18 - 1) (1.74)2 s2 ' + = 3.89 in. 18 18 - 2 Therefore, the test statistic is + For u = n, n, - 2 = 34 and a 5% level of significance, the critical t value is 2.032 (see Table 2-6). For the two-tailed test, the critical t value is found from Table 2-6 using a/2. Therefore, for the two-tailed test, the region of rejection consists of all computed t values less than -2.032 or greater than 2.032. Since the computed value is outside the range from -2.032 to 2.032, the null hypothesis should be rejected. Based on these assumptions and data, we would conclude that the mean monthly precipitations are different. It is important to note that the test was conducted at the 5% level of significance and that this level is selected somewhat arbitrarily. If a I % had been selected, the critical value for 34 de- grees of freedom is 2.729 (see Table 2-6). In this case, the region of rejection would be all val- ues of t less than -2.729 or greater than 2.729. In this case, the null hypothesis could not be re- jected because the computed value of 2.42 lies in the region of acceptance. This fact illustrates the problem with the arbitrary selection of the level of significance. Example 2-8 Assuming that there is no reason to believe that the monthly precipitations for June, July, and August are not independent measurements of the random variable, the data of Table 2-8 can be used to test a hypothesis about the probability distribution of the random variable. For purposes of illustration, the null hypothesis that the monthly precipitation during June, July, and August is normally distributed with a mean of 4 in. and a standard deviation of 2 in. will be tested: In the event that the null hypothesis is rejected, it could be because the assumed distribution is incorrect, the assumed population mean is incorrect, the assumed population variance is incor- rect, or any combination of these. To compute the test statistic given in Table 2-5, it is necessary to establish cells and form a histogram of both the observed and expected frequencies. Since there are 54 values in Table 2-8, 6 cells will be used; the x values separating the cells are chosen so that we can expect simi- lar expected frequencies in each cell. For this purpose, the x values are 2, 3,4, 5, and 6 in. The probabilities for a standard normal distribution were obtained from Table 2-2 after converting the x values to z values using Equation 2-40. The calculations are shown in Table 2-9. The ex- pected frequencies are computed by multiplying the cell probabilities by the sample size of 54. Both the expected (E,) and observed (0,)c ell frequencies must sum to the sample size. The com- puted value of the test statistic (see Table 2-9) equals 9.88. For a 5% level of significance and v = k - 1 = 5 degrees of freedom, the critical X2 value is 11.073 (see Table 2-7). Since the com- puted value of the test statistic is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis is accepted. The sample information is not sufficient enough to reject the assumption of a normal population with Sac. 2.6 Regression Analysis 6 1 TABLE 2-9 Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit for Monthly Precipitation for Wildcat Creek Precipitation Normal Cumulative Cell (Oi- EJ2 (in.) z Probability Probability Ei Oi Ei p = 4 and a = 2.

{"paragraph": "2.6 REGRESSION ANALYSIS Regression analysis is a procedure for fitting an equation to a set of data. Specifically, given a set of measurements on two random variables, y and x, regression provides a means for + finding the values of the coefficients, b, and b,, for the straight line (y = b, b, x) that best fits the data. Statistical optimization has three elements: an objective function, a model, and a sample of y and x values. The function to be optimized is called the objective function, which is an explicit mathematical function that describes what is considered the optimal solution. The mathematical model relates a random variable, called the criterion or dependent vari- able, to the unknowns and the predictor variable x, which is sometimes called the indepen- dent variable. The predictor variable usually has a causal relationship with the criterion vari- able. For example, if one is interested in using measurements of air temperature to predict evaporation rates, the evaporation would be the criterion variable and the temperature would be the predictor variable; alternative predictor variables might be the relative humidity and the wind speed. It is important to note that the objective function and the mathematical model are two separate explicit functions. The third element of statistical optimization is a data set. The data set consists of measured values of the criterion variable and corresponding values of the predictor variable. As an example, one may attempt to relate evaporation (E), the criterion variable, to temperature (I-), which is the predctor variable, using the linear equation + l? = bo b,T (2-48) in which bo and b, are the unknown coefficients and % is the predicted value of E. Because E must be positive and E should increase with increases in T, the solution is considered rational Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 only if b, and b, are nonnegative. To evaluate the unknowns, a set of simultaneous measure- ments on E and T would be made. For example, if we were interested in daily evaporation rates, we may measure the total evaporation for each day in a year and the corresponding av- erage temperature; this would give us 365 observations from which we could estimate the best values of b, and b,. Equation 2 4 8 could then be used to predict E for any value of T. The most frequently used linear model relates a criterion variable y to a single predic- tor variable x by the equation in which b, is the intercept coefficient and b, is the slope coefficient; b, and b, are often called regression coefficients because they are obtained from a regression analysis. Because Equation 2 4 9 involves two variables, y and x, it is sometimes referred to as the bivariate model. The intercept coefficient represents the value of y when x equals zero. The slope co- efficient represents the rate of change in y with respect to change in x. Whereas b, has the same units as y, the units of b, are the ratio of the units of y to x. For Equation 248, E might be expressed in inches/day and Tin OF; therefore, b, has units of incheslday and b, has units of inches/(day- OF). The linear multivariate model relates a criterion variable to two or more predictor vari- ables: in which p is the number of predictor variables, xi the i\" predictor variable, b, the \"i slope co- efficient, and b, the intercept coefficient, where i = 1, 2, ..., p. The coefficients b; are often called partial regression coefficients and have units equal to the ratio of the units of y to xi.

{"paragraph": "2.6.1 Principle of Least Squares The values of the slope and intercept coefficients of Equations 2 4 9 and 2-50 can be com- puted using the principle of least squares. The principle of least squares, which is sometimes referred to as regression analysis, is a process of obtaining \"best\" estimates of the coeffi- cients and is referred to as a regression method. The principle of least squares is used to regress y on either x of Equation 2 4 9 o r the xi values of Equation 2-50. To express the prin- ciple of least squares, it is necessary to define the error, e, or residual, as the difference be- tween the predicted and measured values of the criterion variable: in which jii s the \"i predicted value of the criterion variable, yii s the i\" measured value of y, and ei is the ithe rror. It is important to note that the error is defined as the measured value of y subtracted from the predicted value. Some computer programs use the measured value minus the predicted value. I avoid this definition because it then indicates that a positive residual implies underprediction. With Equation 2-5 1 a positive residual indicates overprediction, while a negative residual indicates underprediction. The objective function for the principle of least squares is to minimize the sum of the squares of the errors: Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis x F = min e: = min x(!i - yi)2 i=l i=l in which n is the number of observations on the criterion variable (for example, the sample size). Solution procedure. The objective function of Equation 2-52 can be minimized yi, by inserting the model (such as Equation 2-49) into Equation 2-52 for taking the deriva- tives of F with respect to each unknown, setting the derivatives equal to zero, and then solv- ing for the unknowns. The solution requires the model for predicting y, to be substituted into the objective function. It is important to note that the derivatives are taken with respect to the unknowns b, and not the predictor variables xi. To illustrate the solution procedure, the model of Equation 2-49 is substituted into the objective function of Equation 2-52, which yields x + F = (b, blxi - yi)2 i=l The derivatives of Equation 2-53 with respect to the unknowns are aF n + - = 2 x (b , blxi - yi)xi = 0 abl i=l Dividing the equations by 2, separating the terms in the summations, and rearranging yields the set of normal equations: + nb, blXx = X y (2-55a) All of the summations in Equations 2-55 are calculated over the n values of the sample; in future equations, the index values of the summations will be omitted when they refer to sum- mation over all elements in a sample of size n. The subscripts for x and y have been omitted but are inferred. The two unknowns b, and b, can be evaluated by solving the two simultane- ous equations (Equation 2-55): Example 2-9 The data of Table 2-10 can be used to illustrate the solution of the least-squares principle for a data set of five observations on two variables.

In solving a linear model using the least squares principle, the sum of the errors always equals 0, which is shown in Table 2-10. The sum of the squares of the errors equals 1.9. It is interesting to note that if a line is passed through the first three observations of Table 2-10, the error for each of these three observations is 0. Such a model would be While three of the residuals are 0, the sum of the squares of the errors for Equation 2-59 equals 2.0, which is greater than the corresponding sum for Equation 2-58.

{"paragraph": "2.6.2 Reliability of the Regression Equation Having evaluated the coefficients of the regression equation, it is of interest to evaluate the reliability of the regression equation. The following criteria should be assessed in evaluating the model: (1) the correlation coefficient, (2) the standard error of estimate, and (3) the ratio- nality of the coefficients and the relative importance of the predictor variables, both of which can be assessed using the standardized partial regression coefficients. Graphical analysis. The first step in examining the relationship between variables is to perform a graphical analysis. Visual inspection of the data can provide the following in- formation: 1. Identify the degree of common variation, which is an indication of the degree to which the two variables are related. 2. Identify the range and distribution of the sample data points. Set, 2.6 Regression Analysis 3. Identify the presence of extreme events. 4. Identify the form of the relationship between the two variables. 5. Identify the type of the relationship. Each of these factors is of importance in the statistical analysis of sample data and decision making. When variables show a high degree of common variation, one assumes that there is a causal relationship. If there is a physical reason to suspect that a causal relationship exists, the association demonstrated by the sample data provides empirical support for the assumed relationship. Common variation implies that when the value of one of the random variables is changed, the value of the other variable will change in a systematic manner. For example, an increase in the value of one variable occurs when the value of the other variable increases. Using the evaporation versus temperature model of Equation 2-48, a high degree of common variation in the sample measurements would be expected because of the physical relation- ship between the two variables. If the change in the one variable is highly predictable from a given change in the other variable, then a high degree of common variation exists. Figure 2-6 shows graphs of different samples of data for two variables having different degrees of common variation. In parts a and e of Figure 2-6, the degree of common variation is very high; thus the variables are said to be correlated. In Figure 2-6c there is no correlation be- tween the two variables because as the value of x is increased it is not certain whether or not y will increase or decrease. In Figure 2-6b and d the degree of correlation is moderate; in Figure 2-6b, it is evident that y will increase as x is increased, but the exact change in y for a FIGURE 2-6 Different degrees of correlation between two random variables (X and y): (a) R = 1.0; (b) R = 0.5; (c) R = 0.0; (d) R = -0.5; (e) R = -1.0; (f) R = 0.3. 66 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 change in x is difficult to estimate. A more quantitative discussion of the concept of common variation will be presented. It is important to use a graphical analysis to identify the range and distribution of the sample data points so that the stability of the relationship can be assessed and so that one can assess the ability of the data sample to represent the distribution of the population. If the range of the data is limited, a computed relationship may not be stable; that is, it may not apply to the distribution of the population. The data set of Figure 2-7a shows a case where the range of the sample is much smaller than the expected range of the population. If an at- tempt is made to use the sample to extrapolate the relationship between the two random vari- ables, a small change in the slope of the relationship would cause a large change in the pre- dicted estimate of y for values of x at the extremes of the range of the population. A graph of two random variables might alert the investigator that there may be stability problems in a derived relationship between two random variables, especially when the relationship is ex- trapolated beyond the range of the sample data. It is important to identify extreme events in a sample of data for several reasons. First, extreme events can dominate a computed relationship between two variables. For example, in Figure 2-7b, the extreme point will suggest a high correlation between x and y; in this case, the cluster of points acts like a single observation. In Figure 2-7c, the extreme point causes a poor correlation between the two random variables; since the cluster of points has the same mean value of y as the value of y of the extreme point, the data of Figure 2-7c sug- gest that a change in y is not associated with a change in x. A correlation coefficient is more sensitive to an extreme point when the sample size is small. An extreme event may be due to (1) errors in recording or plotting the data or (2) a legitimate observation in the tail of the dis- 4 Range of FIGURE 2-7 (a) Instability in the rela- tionship between random variables. Ef- fect of an extreme event in a data sam- X X ple on the correlation: (b) high (b) (c) correlation; (c)l ow correlation. Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis 67 tribution. Therefore, an extreme event must be identified and the reason for the event deter- mined. Otherwise, it will not be possible to properly interpret the results of the correlation analysis. Relationships can be linear or nonlinear. Since the statistical methods to be used for the two forms of a relationship differ, it is important to identify the form. Additionally, the most frequently used correlation coefficient depends on a linear relationship existing between the two random variables; thus low correlations may result from a nonlinear relationship even when the relationship is obvious. For example, the bivariate relationship of Figure 2-6f sug- gests a very predictable trend in the relationship between y and x; however, the correlation is poor because of the nonlinearity of the relationship and it is certainly not as good as that in Figure 2-6a. Graphs relating pairs of variables can be used to identify the type of the relationship. Linear trends can be either direct or indirect, with an indirect relationship indicating a de- crease in y as x increases. This information is useful for chechng the rationality of the rela- tionship, especially when dealing with data sets that include more than two variables. A vari- able that is not dominant in the physical processes that underlie the data may demonstrate a physically irrational relationship with another variable only because of the values of the other variables affecting the physical relationship. Correlation analysis. Correlation is the degree of association between the ele- ments of two samples of data, that is, between observations on two variables. Correlation co- efficients provide a quantitative index of the degree of association. Examples of variables that are assumed to have a causal relationship and significant correlation are the cost of liv- ing and wages, examination grades and IQ, and the volumes of rainfall and streamflow. However, examples that have no cause-and-effect relationship but may have significant cor- relation are (I) the crime rate and the sale of chewing gum over the past two decades, and (2) annual population growth rates in nineteenth century France and annual cancer death rates in the United States in the twentieth century. Assessing causality is just as important as assess- ing the numerical value of a computed correlation coefficient. A set of observations on a random variable y has a certain amount of variation, which may be characterized by the variance of the sample. The variance equals the sum of squares of the deviations of the observations from the mean of the observations divided by the de- grees of freedom. Ignoring the degrees of freedom, this variation can be separated into two parts: that which is associated with a second variable x and that which is not. The total varia- tion (TV), which equals the sum of the squares of the differences between the sample values and the mean of the data points, is separated into the variation that is explained by the second variable (EV) and the variation that is not explained, that is, the unexplained variation (UV). Thus we get Using the general form of the variation of a random variable, each of the three terms in this equation can be represented by a sum of squares: 68 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 where y is an observation on the random variable, j is the value of y estimated from the best y linear relationship with the second variable x, and is the mean of the observations on y. These variation components are shown in Figure 2-8; the dashed lines illustrate the devia- tions of Equation 2-61. Figure 2-8a shows the variation of the observations about the mean; this represents the variation that exists in the sample and that may potentially be explained by the variable x. It reflects the left side of Equation 2-61. The variation in Figure 2-8b rep- resents the variation of the line about the mean and thus corresponds to the first term of the right side of Equation 2-61. If all of the sample points fall on the line, the explained variation will equal the total variation. The variation in Figure 2-8c represents the variation of the points about the line; therefore, it corresponds to the second term on the right side of Equa- tion 2-61. This is the variation that is not explained by the relationship between y and x. If the unexplained variation equals the total variation, the line does not explain any variation and the relationship between x and y is not significant. This separation of variation concept is useful for quantifying the correlation coefficient developed by Karl Pearson. Specifically, dividing both sides of Equation 2-60 by the total variation (TV) gives The ratio EVITV represents the fraction of the total variation that is explained by the linear relationship between y and x; this is called the coefficient of determination: FIGURE 2-8 Separation of variation: (a) total variation; (b) explained variation; (c) unexplained variation. Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis 69 The square root of the ratio is the correlation coefficient, R. If the explained variation equals the total variation, the correlation coefficient will equal 1. If the relationship is inverse and the explained variation equals the total variation in magnitude, R will equal -1. These repre- sent the extremes but both values indicate a perfect association, with the sign only indicating the direction of the relationship. If the explained variation equals 0, R equals 0. Thus a corre- lation coefficient of 0, which is sometimes called the null correlation, indicates the lack of a linear association between the two variables x and y. While Equation 2-63 provides the means to compute a value of the correlation coeffi- cient, it is easily shown that Equation 2-63 can be arranged to This equation is used most often because it does not require prior computation of the means and thus the computational algorithm is easily programmed for a computer. The square of the correlation coefficient (R2)e quals the percentage of the variance in the criterion variable that is explained by variance of the predictor variable. Because of this physical interpretation, R2 is a meaningful indicator of the accuracy of predictions. The graphs of Figure 2-9 are useful for summarizing the major points about correla- tion coefficients. It should be evident from the following discussion that the value of a corre- lation coefficient, which is a single-valued index of common variation, can be misleading. Computing the correlation coefficient is not a substitute for plotting the data. It might be in- teresting to try to assess the correlation coefficient for each of the graphs of Figure 2-9 be- fore reading the discussion in the following paragraphs. The graph of Figure 2-9a suggests a potential for accurate predictions. Because the re- lationship is nonlinear, the correlation coefficient equals 0.7, or R2 = 0.49. Figures 2-9b, 2-9c, 2-9d, and 2-9e show graphs that appear to have a decreasing amount of scatter, which would suggest an increase in R; however, they also show a decrease in the slope of the rela- tionships and a corresponding decrease in the total variation. For each of the four graphs, the correlation coefficient equals 0.7, which indicates that while the scatter decreases, the pro- portional decrease in the total variation causes the four sets of points to have the same degree of correlation. Figures 2-9f, 2-9g, and 2-9h are characterized by the presence of an extreme event. In f and g, the scatter of the remaining points is relatively small. In h, the scatter of the remain- ing points is relatively large. Yet, all three graphs have the same correlation coefficient, yes the magical 0.7. While the extreme point of Figure 2-9g appears to be farther from the mass of points than the extreme point of Figure 2-9f, the correlation is the same because the ex- treme point of Figure 2-9g is within the range of the other values of y and does not increase the total variation as much as the extreme point of Figure 2-9f. Thus, the unexplained varia- tion in part f is larger than that in part g, but it is offset by the larger total variation; thus, the correlations are the same. In part h, the location of the extreme point increases the total varia- tion and offsets the relatively large unexplained variation of the fourteen points near the ori- gin of the graph. In this case, the extreme point significantly influences the location of the straight line. (m) (n) X FIGURE 2-9 Graphical analysis and correlation. Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis 7 1 Figures 2-9i and j show clusters of points. Whlle part i shows greater scatter within the clusters than for part j, the lower slope in part j means less total variation. Thus, the ratios of the unexplained to total variations are the same, which yields equal correlation coefficients, in this case 0.7. It is interesting to note that the ten graphs of Figures 2-9a to 2-9j have identical corre- lation coefficients in spite of the different graphical characteristics. Again, this illustrates the importance of constructing the graph rather than trying to interpret the quality of a relation- ship from the computed correlation coefficient. Figures 2-9k and 2-91 are plots that suggest the effect of a third variable. In each case, if two lines are drawn with positive slopes and intercepts near the origin, with one line hav- ing a low slope and the other a higher slope, the points local to each line suggest a very high correlation for the local points. The two lines can reflect two levels of the third random vari- able. When the points are combined as they are in each plot, the scatter is large, which pro- duces a lower correlation. The correlation for Figure 2-9k is 0.7, while for part 1 it is 0.5. The effect of the third variable is easily illustrated by separating the points of Figure 2-91, as shown in parts m and n. Both of these plots suggest high correlation, which they are: 0.98 for Figure 2-9m and 0.90 for Figure 2-91-1. These four graphs show that, if the effect of a third variable is ignored it can distort the value of the correlation between two variables. Standard error of estimate. In the absence of additional information, the mean 6)is the best estimate of the criterion variable; the standard deviation S, of y is an indication of the prediction accuracy of the mean. If y is related to a predictor variable x and y is re- gressed on x using the linear model of Equation 2-49, the error of prediction is reduced from S, to the standard error of estimate, S,. Mathematically, the standard error of estimate equals the standard deviation of the errors and has the same units as y: in which v is the degrees of freedom, which equals the sample size minus the number of un- knowns. For the bivariate model of Equation 2-49, p = 1 and v = n - 2. For the general linear + model with an intercept, Equation 2-50, there are (p 1) unknowns; thus v = n - p - 1. In terms of the separation of variation concept discussed previously, the standard error of esti- mate equals the square root of the ratio of the unexplained variation to the degrees of free- dom. To assess the reliability of the regression equation, Se should be compared with the bounds of 0 and S,. If S, is near S,, the regression equation has not made a significant im- provement in prediction accuracy. 1f S, is much smaller than S, and is near 0, the regression analysis has improved the reliability of prediction. It is import& to note that S, is based on (n - p - 1) degrees of freedom, the error S, is based on (n - 1) degrees of freedom, and the correlation coefficient is based on n degrees of freedom. Thus, in some cases S, may be greater than S,, which indicates that the mean is a better means of prediction than is the re- gression equation. The standard error of estimate is sometimes computed by 72 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 Equation 2-66 must be considered as only an approximation to Equation 2-65 because R is based on n degrees of freedom and S, is based on (n 1) degrees of freedom. Using the sepa- - ration of variation concept, the exact relationship between Se, S,, and R can be computed. Given the total variation W i s related to the variance of y by The square of the correlation coefficient is the ratio of the explained variation EV to the total variation 7V The standard error of estimate is related to the unexplained variation UV by Equation 2-68 can be solved for W, which can then be substituted into Equations 2-67 and 2-69. Equation 2-69 can then be solved for EV, which can also be substituted into Equation 2-67. Equation 2-70 can be solved for UV, which is also substituted into Equation 2-67. Solving for S: yields Thus Equation 2-71 is a more exact relationship than Equation 2-66; however, for large sample sizes the difference between the two estimates will be small. Although S , may actually be greater than S,, in general, Se will be within the range from zero to S,,. When the equation fits the data points exactly, Se equals 0; this corresponds to a correlation coefficient of 1. When the correlation coefficient equals 0, Se equals S,; as in- dicated previously, Se may actually exceed S,, when the degrees of freedom have a significant effect. The standard error of estimate is often preferred to the correlation coefficient because Se has the same units as the criterion variable and its magnitude is a physical indicator of the error.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of evaluating the reliability of a regression equation, what criteria should be assessed?", "answer": "The criteria to be assessed include the correlation coefficient, the standard error of estimate, and the rationality of the coefficients and the relative importance of the predictor variables."}, {"question": "Why is graphical analysis important in examining the relationship between variables?", "answer": "Graphical analysis is crucial because it allows for the identification of the degree of common variation, the range and distribution of the sample data points, the presence of extreme events, the form of the relationship, and the type of relationship, all of which are essential for understanding the relationship between variables and for assessing the stability and reliability of the regression equation."}, {"question": "How does the presence of extreme events affect the correlation coefficient?", "answer": "The presence of extreme events can significantly affect the correlation coefficient, as these events can dominate the computed relationship between two variables.

{"paragraph": "2.6.3 Correlation versus Regression Before discussion of other topics in correlation and regression it is important to emphasize the differences between correlation and regression. Regression is a means of fitting the coef- ficients of a prediction equation; correlation provides a measure of goodness of fit. Regres- sion is a method for model calibration, while correlation would have usefulness in model for- mulation and model verification. It is improper to refer to an equation fitted with least Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis 73 squares as a correlation equation. When using regression, it is necessary to specify which variable is the criterion and which is the predictor. When using correlation it is not necessary to make such a distinction. The correlation coefficients for y on x and x on y are the same, but the regression relationships are not the same. The distinction is necessary with regression be- cause a regression equation is not transformable, unless the correlation coefficient equals 1. O. That is, if y is the criterion variable when the equation is calibrated, the equation cannot be rearranged algebraically to get an equation for predicting x. Specifically, Equation 2-49 can be algebraically rearranged to predict x: If values of a, and a, are obtained by regressing values of x on y, the resulting coefficients of Equation 2-72e will not be the same as the coefficients obtained by regressing y on x (Equa- tion 2-72a) and then setting a, = -bdbl and a, = llb,. The only exception to this is when the correlation coefficient equals 1 .O. For a given data set, the correlation coefficient for the re- gression of y on x will be the same as the correlation for the regression of x on y. Computa- tionally, the correlation coefficient is a function of the explained and total variation; the slope coefficient of a regression equation (Equation 2-49) is related to the correlation coeffi- cient by .x in which S, and S, are the standard deviations of x and y, respectively. In summary, correlation and regression differ in their use, computation, and interpreta- tion. The two statistical methods are quite different. Example 2-10 The data of Table 2-1 1 are the drainage area A (mi2) and mean annual flood Q (ft3/sec) for six basins in the Sleepers River Experimental Watershed, Vermont. With the drainage area as the predictor variable, the regression coefficients can be computed from Equations 2-56: 74 Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 TABLE 2-1 1 Regression of Drainage Drea (A) on the Mean Annual Flood (Q) for Six Watersheds in the Sleepers River Experimental Watershed, Vermont This yields the model The predicted values Q for each of the six watersheds are given in Table 2-1 1. The errors are 4; also shown; the sum of the errors equals 0, as it always will with a linear regression analysis. The sum of the squares of the errors can be used with Equation 2-65 to compute the standard error of estimate: The correlation coefficient can be computed with Equation 2-64 and the sums given in Table 2-1 1: The standard deviation of the mean annual flood can be computed using Equation 2-23: 1,\"' (1.543.024) - - (2472)2 = 323.9 ft3/sec 6 Thus the ratio SJS, equals 113 %. For small samples the SJS, ratio is a better indicator of relia- bility than the correlation coefficient. In either case, the prediction equation provides accurate estimates of the mean annual discharge for watersheds similar to the six watersheds used to com- pute the regression equation. Example 2-1 1 Precipitation (P)i s a primary determinant of runoff (R),a nd so a number of equations have been developed for predicting R from measurements of P. Table 2-12 gives the total monthly precipi- tation and runoff, both presented as depths in inches, for December during the ten years from 1960 to 1969 on Wildcat Creek near Lawrenceville, Georgia. Figure 2-10 shows the data. The data were analyzed using regression analysis. Based on the summations given in Table 2-12, the slope and intercept coefficients are Sec. 2.6 Regression Analysis 75 TABLE 2-12 December Precipitation (in.) and Runoff (in.) for Wildcat Creek near Lawrenceville, Georgia, 1960-1 969 Year P R p2 R~ PR R e The resulting regression line derived from these coefficients is also shown in Figure 2-10. The intercept is nearly 0, which is rational since runoff would not be expected when the total monthly precipitation is 0. A hypothesis test could be made to determine whether or not the in- tercept is statistically different from 0. The slightly positive value of b, might suggest that ground water flowing into the channel contributes to the total monthly runoff. The regression equation was used to predict monthly values of runoff, R, and compute the residuals, e, which are also given on Table 2-12.

{"paragraph": "2.6.4 Calibration of the Multiple Linear Regression Model The components of an unconstrained regression analysis include the model, the objective function, and the data set. The data set consists of a set of n observations on p predictor vari- ables and one criterion variable, where n should be, if possible, at least four times greater + than p.

We consider that some runoff mea- sured in March is the result of rainfall in March, but some of this runoff also is the result of de- layed response of the stream to rain that fell in February.

The coefficients b, and b, are the regression coefficients that scale the rainfall to the runoff.

The quantified physical inter- pretation of the wintertime monthly runoff process is, therefore, as follows. A potential for runoff is generated as soon as monthly rainfall exceeds about 0.05 in. About 59% of this poten- tial becomes runoff in the month during which the rain fell. An additional 12% becomes runoff the following month. In Figure 2-1 1 it should be noted that the proportions 59% and 12% are set reasonably well by the data. The threshold value of 0.05 in. seems small.

However, this structure is incorporated in the conceptualization of the model, and the model can only do what it was designed to do.

This relationship allows for the computation of the coefficient of multiple determination, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the predictor variables."}, {"question": "How does the concept of initial abstraction affect the runoff process in the context of the simple linear model?", "answer": "The concept of initial abstraction affects the runoff process by representing the amount of rainfall that does not become runoff. In the simple linear model, the initial abstraction is represented by the terms I_m and I_f, which are subtracted from the rainfall amounts to determine the potential for runoff. The model suggests that a potential for runoff is generated as soon as monthly rainfall exceeds the initial abstraction, and that a portion of this potential becomes runoff in the month during which the rain fell, while another portion becomes runoff the following month."}, {"question": "What is the implication of assuming that I_af equals I_m in the context of the wintertime monthly runoff process?", "answer": "Assuming that I_af equals I_m implies that the threshold values for rainfall to generate runoff are the same for the months of February and March, which are part of the dormant season of the year. This assumption allows for the estimation of the initial abstraction value, which is found to be approximately 0.049 inches. However, this assumption may not always be valid, and the model's performance may be affected by this simplification."}, {"question": "In the context of the quantified physical interpretation of the wintertime monthly runoff process, what is the proportion of potential runoff that becomes runoff in the month during which the rain fell?", "answer": "According to the model, about 59% of the potential runoff becomes runoff in the month during which the rain fell, while an additional 12% becomes runoff the following month. This proportion is set reasonably well by the data, and it provides insight into the timing and magnitude of the runoff response to rainfall."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to determine the threshold values of the model, I_m and I_f, exactly?", "answer": "The threshold values of the model, I_m and I_f, cannot be determined exactly because they are embedded in the intercept term of the regression equation. The model can only provide an estimate of the initial abstraction value, which is based on the assumption that I_af equals I_m. This limitation highlights the importance of careful model conceptualization and the need for additional data or information to improve the accuracy of the model."}, {"question": "How does the standard error of estimate compare to Sy in the context of the White Hollow watershed data?", "answer": "The standard error of estimate of 0.7081 in. is compared to a Sy of 1.4542 in., indicating that the model has resulted in a relatively good fit to the data. This comparison suggests that the model may be useful for predictive purposes, but it is essential to consider the limitations and uncertainties associated with the model, such as the assumption of equal threshold values for February and March."}, {"question": "In the context of the simple linear model, what is the role of the coefficients b_1 and b_2 in scaling the rainfall to runoff?", "answer": "The coefficients b_1 and b_2 scale the rainfall to runoff by representing the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff in the month during which the rain fell and the following month, respectively. These coefficients are essential in quantifying the relationship between rainfall and runoff and provide insight into the timing and magnitude of the runoff response."}]}

{"paragraph": "2.7 STEPWISE REGRESSION Stepwise regression is a term that is applied to several algorithms for simultaneously select- ing variables and calibrating a regression equation. The algorithms differ in the sequence of selecting variables. Forward regression starts with the predictor variable having the highest correlation with the criterion variable and continues adding variables so that the explained variance (Equation 2-69) is maximized at each step; a test of hypothesis is performed at each step and computation ends when all statistically significant predictor variables have been in- cluded. Backward regression, a second form of stepwise regression, begins with an equation that includes all of the predictor variables in the analysis and sequentially deletes variables, with the predictor variable contributing the least explained variance being deleted first. The third and fourth forms of stepwise regression are variations of the first two forms. Forward stepwise regression with deletion, which is the method discussed in this chapter, adds vari- ables to maximize the total variation at each step; however, at each step those predictor vari- ables that are already included in the equation are checked to ensure that they are still statisti- cally significant. A variable found to be no longer significant is deleted. The fourth form of stepwise regression is backward regression with addition. This method is similar to the sec- ond form except that at each step all of the predictor variables that have been deleted are checked again for statistical significance; if any variable that was previously deleted is found to be significant, it is added back into the equation. All stepwise regression algorithms are based on the same statistical concepts.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of stepwise regression, what is the primary goal of forward regression?", "answer": "The primary goal of forward regression is to select variables and calibrate a regression equation by starting with the predictor variable having the highest correlation with the criterion variable and adding variables to maximize the explained variance."}, {"question": "How does backward regression differ from forward regression in the stepwise regression process?", "answer": "Backward regression differs from forward regression in that it begins with an equation including all predictor variables and sequentially deletes variables, starting with the one contributing the least explained variance, whereas forward regression starts with the most correlated variable and adds variables."}, {"question": "In the context of stepwise regression algorithms, why is it necessary to perform a test of hypothesis at each step?", "answer": "Performing a test of hypothesis at each step is necessary to ensure that only statistically significant predictor variables are included in the equation, thereby maximizing the explained variance and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary variables. This process helps in identifying the most relevant variables that contribute significantly to the regression equation, which is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the model. By doing so, it prevents overfitting and enhances the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data."}, {"question": "What is the key difference between forward stepwise regression with deletion and backward regression with addition?", "answer": "The key difference lies in their approach to variable selection and deletion. Forward stepwise regression with deletion adds variables to maximize total variation at each step but also checks and deletes any previously included variables that are no longer statistically significant. In contrast, backward regression with addition starts with all variables, deletes the least significant ones, and then re-checks deleted variables for significance, adding them back if they become significant."}, {"question": "How does the inclusion of statistically significant predictor variables impact the regression equation in stepwise regression?", "answer": "The inclusion of statistically significant predictor variables in the regression equation enhances its explanatory power by maximizing the explained variance. This means that the model better captures the underlying relationships between the predictor variables and the criterion variable, leading to more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of the phenomena being studied. Furthermore, by ensuring that only significant variables are included, the model avoids unnecessary complexity and reduces the risk of overfitting, making it more robust and reliable for future predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is stepwise regression useful for selecting predictor variables?", "answer": "Stepwise regression is useful in hydrological modeling for selecting predictor variables because it systematically evaluates the contribution of each variable to the model's explanatory power, allowing for the identification of the most relevant variables that significantly impact the hydrological process being modeled. This is particularly important in hydrology, where complex interactions between numerous variables can make it challenging to determine which factors are most influential. By applying stepwise regression, researchers can develop more parsimonious and effective models that capture the essential dynamics of hydrological systems."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using forward stepwise regression without the deletion step in hydrological modeling?", "answer": "Using forward stepwise regression without the deletion step can lead to the inclusion of predictor variables that are no longer statistically significant as more variables are added, potentially resulting in overfitting and decreased model performance on new data. This can have significant implications for hydrological modeling, where the goal is often to predict future outcomes based on historical data. Models that are overfit to the training data may not generalize well, leading to inaccurate predictions and poor decision-making. Therefore, incorporating the deletion step is crucial to maintain the model's integrity and predictive capability."}, {"question": "How do the different forms of stepwise regression (forward, backward, with deletion, with addition) address the challenge of variable selection in hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The different forms of stepwise regression address the challenge of variable selection by providing systematic approaches to evaluating the significance and contribution of predictor variables. Forward regression starts with the most correlated variable and adds others based on their contribution to explained variance, while backward regression starts with all variables and deletes the least significant ones. The inclusion of deletion and addition steps in forward and backward regression, respectively, further refines the model by ensuring that only statistically significant variables are retained or re-added. This flexibility in stepwise regression methods allows hydrologists to choose the approach that best suits their specific modeling needs and data characteristics, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of hydrological models."}, {"question": "In the context of stepwise regression, why is maximizing explained variance at each step important?", "answer": "Maximizing explained variance at each step is important because it ensures that the variables added to the model contribute significantly to the explanation of the criterion variable, thereby enhancing the model's predictive power and reducing the risk of including irrelevant variables.

On the other hand, the rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that at least one predictor variable is statistically significant, implying a genuine relationship between the predictor(s) and the criterion variable.

There are three basic elements: (1) partial F tests for insertion, (2) partial F tests for deletion, and (3) total F tests. The general procedure is outlined in Figure 2-12 and discussed in the fol- lowing paragraphs. Partial F test for insertion (Step 1). The partial F values for all predictor vari- ables that are not included in the equation should be computed. The variable with the largest partial F should be selected to enter the equation. On the first step, the partial correlations equal the predictor-criterion correlations, so the predictor variable that has the largest predictor-criterion correlation is added first. The partial F test for insertion is made: (a) If F < Fa, the variable is not significant and the equation from the previous iteration is the final model (if this option occurs with the first predictor variable tested, then the criterion variable is not significantly related to any of the predictor variables). (b) If F > Fa, the variable is statistically significant and the variable should be included in the equation; the process should proceed to the total F test (Step 2). Total F test (Step 2). An equation that includes all predictor variables that have been inserted and not subsequently deleted is calibrated. The total F value is calculated and compared with the critical value Fa. (a) If F < Fa, the equation calibrated for the previous iteration should be used as the final model. (b) If F > Fa, the entire model is significant, and all of the predictor variables that are in the equation should be tested for significance; control should then proceed to Step 3. Partial F test for deletion (Step 3). Partial F values for all predictor variables that are included in the equation are computed. The variable that has the smallest F value is compared with the critical F value, Fa. (a) If F < Fa, the predictor variable is not significant and it is deleted from the equation; control then passes to the total F test (Step 2).

It iteratively adds variables that are statistically significant and removes those that are not, as determined by comparisons with the critical value Fa. This iterative process refines the model, leading to a final equation that includes only predictor variables that contribute significantly to the model's predictive power."}, {"question": "In the context of model development, what is the role of the total F test in the stepwise regression procedure?", "answer": "The total F test plays a critical role in the stepwise regression procedure by evaluating the overall significance of the model after each insertion of a new predictor variable. It assesses whether the inclusion of additional variables improves the model's predictive capability. If the total F value exceeds the critical value Fa, it indicates that the model, with its current set of predictor variables, is statistically significant, thereby justifying the inclusion of these variables. Conversely, if the total F value is less than Fa, it suggests that the current model does not offer a significant improvement, leading to the consideration of previous models or the deletion of non-significant variables."}, {"question": "Why is it important to iteratively apply partial F tests for insertion and deletion in the stepwise regression procedure?", "answer": "Iteratively applying partial F tests for insertion and deletion is important because it allows for a dynamic and adaptive model building process.

{"paragraph": "2.8.1 Transformation and Calibration The power and polynomial models are widely used nonlinear forms because they can be transformed in a way that makes it possible to use the principle of least squares. Although the transformation to a linear structure is desirable from the standpoint of calibration, it has important consequences in terms of assessing the goodness-of-fit statistics. The bivariate polynomial of Equation 2-1 10 can be calibrated by forming a new set of predictor variables: This results in the model = bo + blw, + b2w2 + --. + bpwp The coefficients bj can be estimated using a standard multiple regression analysis. The bivariate power model of Equation 2-1 11 can be calibrated by forming the follow- ing set of variables: z = logy (2-1 16) c = log bo (2- 1 17 ) w = log x (2-1 18 ) See. 2.8 Analysis of Nonlinear Equations 89 These transformed variables form the following linear equation, which can be calibrated using bivariate linear regression analysis: + z = c blw (2- 11 9 ) After values of c and b, are obtained, the coefficient b, can be determined using Natural logarithms can also be used; in such a case, Equations 2-1 16 to 2-1 18 will use the base e logarithm and Equation 2-120 will use a base e rather than 10. The multivariate polynomial of Equation 2-1 12 can also be solved using a multiple re- gression analysis for a set of transformed variables. For the model given by Equation 2-1 12, the predictor variables are transformed as follows: w4 = x2 2 (2- 12 4) The revised model has the form It is important to note that the polynomial models do not require a transformation of the cri- terion variable. The model given by Equation 2-1 12 has only two predictor variables (for example, x, and x,) and is a second-order equation. In practice, a model may have more predictor vari- ables and may be of higher order. In some cases the interaction terms (for example, x ~ma~y ) be omitted to decrease the number of coefficients that must be calibrated. However, if the in- teraction terms are omitted when they are actually significant, the goodness-of-fit statistics may suffer unless the variation is explained by the other terms in the model; when this oc- curs, the coefficients may lack physical significance. The multivariate power model of Equation 2-1 13 can be evaluated by malung a loga- rithmic transformation of both the criterion and the predictor variables: z = logy (2-1 27) c = log b, (2-128) wi = log xi The resulting model has the form Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 The coefficients of Equation 2-130 can be evaluated using a multiple regression analy- sis. The value of b, can be determined by malung the transformation of Equation 2-120. Again, it is possible to use a base e transformation rather than a base 10 log transformation. PROBLEMS 2-1.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to making technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1 What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Statistical Methods in Hydrology Chap. 2 Case. A research hydrologist makes a statistical analysis of data collected as part of a research program. Part of the analysis involves a hypothesis test. The test leads to the deci- sion to reject the research null hypothesis that the researcher wanted and expected to be ac- cepted. In reviewing the statistical test, the researcher recognizes that the null hypothesis would have been accepted if a more stringent level of significance had been used. While the commonly used level of significance was initially employed, the researcher reports the re- sults using the more stringent level of significance so that the finding supports the initial expectations.

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the goodness-of-fit statistics to ensure that the transformed model accurately represents the underlying relationships."}, {"question": "In the context of multivariate polynomial models, what is the implication of omitting interaction terms on the goodness-of-fit statistics?", "answer": "Omitting interaction terms in multivariate polynomial models can lead to a decrease in the number of coefficients that must be calibrated. However, if the interaction terms are significant, omitting them can result in poor goodness-of-fit statistics, unless the variation is explained by other terms in the model. This can also lead to coefficients lacking physical significance, making it challenging to interpret the results."}, {"question": "How can the bivariate power model be calibrated using a linear regression analysis?", "answer": "The bivariate power model can be calibrated by forming a new set of variables through logarithmic transformations, resulting in a linear equation that can be solved using bivariate linear regression analysis.

The level of significance, typically set at 5% or 1%, determines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. A more stringent level of significance, such as 1%, requires stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis, whereas a less stringent level, such as 5%, requires weaker evidence.

A high correlation coefficient indicates a strong relationship, while a low coefficient indicates a weak relationship. The reliability of the model is also influenced by the correlation coefficient, as a high coefficient suggests that the model is better at predicting the criterion variable. However, correlation does not imply causation, and other factors, such as the sample size, data quality, and model assumptions, also affect the reliability of the model."}, {"question": "How do polynomial models often yield irrational coefficients, and what are the implications for hydrological analysis?", "answer": "Polynomial models can yield irrational coefficients due to the high correlation between terms such as x and x^2. This can lead to unstable and unreliable models, making it challenging to interpret the results. In hydrological analysis, this can have significant implications, as the models are used to predict and manage water resources.

{"paragraph": "3.1 INTRODUCTION Every hydrologic design is different because the factors that affect the design vary with loca- tion. It is necessary to make measurements at the design site of factors that affect the design. The factors to be measured characterize the processes of the hydrologic cycle that are impor- tant to the design problem. Factors such as the following may be important: the size, slope, and land use of the watershed, as well as the amount of storage and vegetation within the channel. Given the importance of such factors as input to a hydrologic design, the accuracy with which the measurements of these factors are made will partly determine the accuracy of a design. The objective of this chapter is to define some of the more important watershed char- acteristics and discuss alternative methods for representing each characteristic. Watershed characteristics that are used as inputs to hydrologic design methods include the drainage area, linear measurements such as the watershed or channel length, the shape of the water- shed, the slope of the watershed or channel, the drainage pattern, channel roughness and cross-sectional properties, time of flow parameters, and the land cover. The soil type is also important. 100 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 3.1. I Analysis versus Synthesis In hydrologic analysis, the watershed characteristics are used in defining the nature of the transfer function (Figure 1-3). In hydrologic synthesis or design, the characteristics are mea- sured at the design site in order to define the transfer function that is necessary to compute the output function. When using a hydrologic model for design, the watershed characteristics that are required as input to the design method should be similar in magnitude to the values that were used in development of the design method (i.e., the analysis phase). When the val- ues of the characteristics used for design are much different from those used in developing the design method, the design represents an extrapolation of the design method and may not be accurate because of the extrapolation. Therefore, it is important for the design engineer to be knowledgeable about the development of the design method and not just be able to make the measurements of the input characteristics of the design method. As an example, consider the problem of estimating the maximum flood flow, which is the peak discharge qp of Chapter 7 . Many investigators have developed simple prediction equations that relate the peak discharge to the drainage area A. If, for example, the parameter C in the equation qp = CiA is based on watersheds for drainage areas from 1 to 200 acres, the equation may not provide accurate design estimates of qp for drainage areas outside this range. In this case, the use of the equation for synthesis or design should be based on knowl- edge of the values of the watershed characteristics used in the analysis phase.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why are measurements at the design site necessary?", "answer": "Measurements at the design site are necessary because the factors that affect the design vary with location, and accurate measurements of these factors partly determine the accuracy of the design."}, {"question": "What factors may be important in characterizing the hydrologic cycle for a design problem?", "answer": "Factors such as the size, slope, and land use of the watershed, as well as the amount of storage and vegetation within the channel, may be important in characterizing the hydrologic cycle for a design problem."}, {"question": "How do watershed characteristics influence the accuracy of hydrologic design methods?", "answer": "The accuracy with which the measurements of watershed characteristics are made will partly determine the accuracy of a design, as these characteristics are used as inputs to hydrologic design methods.

For example, if a parameter is based on watersheds for drainage areas from 1 to 200 acres, the equation may not provide accurate design estimates for drainage areas outside this range. This limitation underscores the need for engineers to consider the range of applicability when using such equations for design purposes."}, {"question": "What implications arise when using a hydrologic model for design with watershed characteristics that differ significantly from those used in the model's development?", "answer": "When using a hydrologic model for design with watershed characteristics that differ significantly from those used in the model's development, the design represents an extrapolation of the design method and may not be accurate.

Therefore, it is critical for engineers to understand the limitations of design methods and carefully evaluate their applicability to specific design scenarios."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.2 WATERSHED The concept of a watershed is basic to all hydrologic designs. Since large watersheds are made up of many smaller watersheds, it is necessary to define the watershed in terms of a point; this point is usually the location at which the design is being made and is referred to as the watershed \"outlet.\" With respect to the outlet, the watershed consists of all land area that sheds water to the outlet during a rainstorm. Using the concept that \"water runs downhill,\" a watershed is defined by all points enclosed within an area from which rain falling at these points will contribute water to the outlet. This is best shown pictorially, as in Figure 3-1. The shaded area of Figure 3-1 represents the watershed for the outlet at point A. Water is con- tributed to the outlet from many smaller areas, which are also watersheds. For example, if a design were being made at point B rather than point A, the watershed would be the small area enclosed within the dashed lines. The watershed for point B is made up of smaller water- sheds, with the two stream tributaries reflecting the collecting areas for water resulting from rain on the watershed. The concept of smaller watersheds malung bigger watersheds can be carried to the extreme. The watershed of the Mississippi River drains almost fourteen million square miles, and the continental divide, which runs from northern Montana to southern New Mexico, divides the continuous part of the United States into two watersheds, with one wa- tershed directing runoff to the Pacific Ocean and the other watershed to the Atlantic Ocean. Given this definition of a watershed and assuming that the delineation of a watershed is important to hydrologic design, it is necessary to show how the boundary of a watershed is delineated. Keeping in mind that the boundary of a watershed is defined by all points that will shed water to the outlet, it is only necessary to decide which points in a region will con- Sec. 3.2 Watershed: Definition and Delineation FIGURE 3-1 Delineation of watershed boundary. tribute water to the outlet; the most extreme of these points represents the watershed boundary. Consider the hypothetical schematic of a topographic map that is shown in Figure 3-2. If the point of design is at A, which is the outlet of the watershed and the downstream end of reach AB, then all points bounded by the elevation contours CDEF would contribute runoff to point A. Water will travel perpendicular to the elevation contours, which is the direction that maximizes the slope. Rain falling at points C and F would travel overland directly to point A. Rain falling at points D and E would travel toward the upper end of the channel (i.e., point B), and from there the water would travel in the channel to point A. Rain falling at points G, H, and K would not flow toward point A because the elevations of these points are less than that of the watershed divide, which has an elevation of 70; thus the rain falling at these three points would travel to the outlet of other watersheds.

Channel extended to basin divide Subwatershed 3 ' Watershed outlet (point A) FIGURE 3-3(b) Delineation of watershed boundary. As indicated previously, the watershed boundary is defined by identifying all points within an area from which rain will contribute water to the outlet. The hypothetical water- shed of Figure 3-2 suggests that watersheds have regular geometric shapes such as rectan- gles. This is not generally the case. Figure 3-3a shows a topographic map of an area. If one were interested in making a design at point A, the watershed boundary would be delineated by drawing lines perpendicular to the elevation contour lines for land that drains to point A. The resulting watershed boundary is shown in Figure 3-3b. Approximately 3600 feet up- stream of point A the channel divides, with one stream channel coming from the northwest and the other from a direction slightly south of west. Using the confluence of the two tribu- taries as a point, the subwatersheds that drain the tributaries can be delineated, as shown in Figure 3-3b. Thus the watershed can be viewed as consisting of three subwatersheds. Subdi- viding a watershed is often necessary for modeling, such as when only a portion of the wa- tershed is being developed and stormwater management is necessary.

{"paragraph": "3.3.1 Drainage Area The drainage area (A) is probably the single most important watershed characteristic for hy- drologic design. It reflects the volume of water that can be generated from rainfall. It is com- mon in hydrologic design to assume a constant depth of rainfall occurring uniformly over the watershed. Under this assumption, the volume of water available for runoff would be the product of the rainfall depth and the drainage area. Thus the drainage area is required as input to models ranging from simple linear prediction equations to corilplex computer models. The drainage area of a watershed requires the delineation of the watershed boundary. Geographic information systems are commonly used to delineate watershed boundaries. Once thls is done, the area is automatically computed. The area can be computed manually with an instrument called a planimeter. Where this is not available, the \"stone-age\" method of counting squares can be used. A transparency showing a grid, usually square, is laid over the map showing the drainage boundaries, and the number of gnd blocks within the bound- ary is counted. The drainage area equals the product of the number of grid blocks and the area of each grid block. The area of each grid block is computed using the scale of the topo- graphic map from which the watershed boundary was delineated. The accuracy of the esti- mated value of the drainage area will depend on the care taken in counting the grid blocks, especially the partial grid blocks along the watershed boundary. Given the importance of the drainage area in hydrologic design, special care should be made to ensure that the estimated value of the drainage area is accurate. As computers become more prevalent in hydrologic design, they are being used to com- pute drainage areas. The watershed boundary can be delineated by indicating the latitude and longitude of points along the boundary; the boundary is assumed to be linear between each pair of points and the drainage area is the area enclosed by the series of linear segments. The drainage area is computed internally by the computer using basic trigonometry. Some soft- ware packages do not even require the user to specify points; from the user-specified water- shed outlet, the watershed boundary is constructed from an analysis of computed slopes, with the slopes evaluated numerically from the topographic map that is stored within the computer. Example 3-1 To illustrate the calculation of the drainage area, Figure 3-4 shows the watershed of Figure 3-3 with a square-grid overlay. The scale of the top0 map is 1 in. = 2000 ft. Since each side of the grid square is 0.1 in., then each square of the grid represents an area of 40,000 ft2, or slightly less than 1 acre. The watershed boundary encloses 733 squares. Thus the total drainage area is 673 acres. The areas of the three subwatersheds can be determined at the same time. They have areas of 375, 179, and 11 9 acres.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why is the drainage area considered the most important watershed characteristic?", "answer": "The drainage area is considered the most important watershed characteristic in hydrologic design because it reflects the volume of water that can be generated from rainfall, directly influencing the volume of water available for runoff.

Inaccuracies in drainage area estimation can lead to flawed predictions and decisions in hydrologic design, highlighting the need for meticulousness in this process."}, {"question": "How do computers and software packages facilitate the computation of drainage areas in hydrologic design?", "answer": "Computers and software packages significantly facilitate the computation of drainage areas by allowing for the delineation of watershed boundaries through the input of latitude and longitude points.

The wa- Sec. 3.3 Watershed Geomorphology FIGURE 3-4 Delineation of watershed boundary. tershed length is also highly correlated with channel length, which is discussed in Sec- tion 3.5.1. Watershed length is usually defined as the distance measured along the main channel from the watershed outlet to the basin divide. Since the channel does not extend to the basin divide, it is necessary to extend a line from the end of the channel to the basin divide follow- ing a path where the greatest volume of water would travel. The straight-line distance from the outlet to the farthest point on the watershed divide is not usually used to compute L be- cause the travel distance of flood waters is conceptually the length of interest. Thus, the length is measured along the principal flow path. Since it will be used for hydrologic calcula- tions, this length is more appropriately labeled the hydrologic length. While the drainage area and length are both measures of watershed size, they may re- flect different aspects of size. The drainage area is used to indicate the potential for rainfall to provide a volume of water. The length is usually used in computing a time parameter, which Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 is a measure of the travel time of water through the watershed. Specific time parameters will be discussed in Section 3.6. Example 3-2 The lengths of the channel and total watershed for the basins of Figure 3-4 are delineated in Fig- ure 3-3b. Based on a map scale of 1 in. equals 2000 ft, the lengths were computed using a map wheel (see Table 3-1).

{"paragraph": "3.3.3 Watershed Slope Flood magnitudes reflect the momentum of the runoff. Slope is an important factor in the momentum. Both watershed and channel slope may be of interest. Watershed slope reflects the rate of change of elevation with respect to distance along the principal flow path. Typi- cally, the principal flow path is delineated, and the watershed slope (S) is computed as the difference in elevation (A,??) between the end points of the principal flow path divided by the hydrologic length of the flow path (L): The elevation difference AE may not necessarily be the maximum elevation difference within the watershed since the point of highest elevation may occur along a side boundary of the watershed rather than at the end of the principal flow path. Where the design work requires the watershed to be subdivided, it will be necessary to compute the slopes of each subarea. It may also be necessary to compute the channel slopes for the individual sections of the streams that flow through the subareas. When computing the slope of a subarea, the principal flow path for that subarea must be delineated. It should reflect flow only for that subarea rather than flow that enters the subarea in a channel. The stream-reach slope may also be necessary for computing reach travel times. Example 3-3 The upper and lower elevations for the watersheds of Figure 3-3b are given in Table 3-1.

{"paragraph": "3.3.4 Hypsometric Curve The hypsometric curve is a description of the cumulative relationship between elevation and the area within elevation intervals. The curve is plotted with the elevation plotted as the ordi- nate and the area within the watershed above the elevation plotted as the abscissa. The hyp- sometric curve can also be represented in standardized form, with the cumulative fractions plotted rather than the actual values. This is shown in Figure 3-5b for a hypothetical water- shed (Figure 3-5a). The standardized form is useful for comparing the area-elevation charac- teristics of watersheds. Such comparison might be useful if a regional hypsometric curve were being developed from the analysis of hypsometric curves of watersheds in the region; after standardizing the hypsometric curves for each watershed, an \"average\" curve could be constructed for the region. Where the necessary data are not available at other watersheds in the region, the regional hypsometric curve could be used to represent the area-elevation char- acteristics of the watershed. A number of indices have been developed to convert the hypsometric curve into a single-valued index of the area-elevation characteristics of a watershed. For example, the hypsometric area ratio (Ha) is the ratio of the area under the hypsometric curve to the area of the square formed by the points (0, O), (0, l), (1, I), and (1, 0) on the hypsometric curve of Figure 3-5b. For the hypsometric curve of Figure 3-5b, Ha equals 0.43. The profile factor (F,) is a second example of a single-valued index that can be derived from a hypsometric curve. The profile factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum devia- tion (Dm)of the hypsometric curve from a line connecting the points (0, 1) and (1, 0) to the length of the line (L,); this is shown in Figure 3-6.

{"paragraph": "3.3.5 Watershed Shape Basin shape is not usually used directly in hydrologic design methods; however, parameters that reflect basin shape are used occasionally and have a conceptual basis, so a few words about it are in order. Watersheds have an infinite variety of shapes, and the shape supposedly reflects the way that runoff will \"bunch up\" at the outlet. A circular watershed would result in runoff from various parts of the watershed reaching the outlet at the same time. An elliptical watershed having the outlet at one end of the major axis and having the same area as the circu- lar watershed would cause the runoff to be spread out over time, thus producing a smaller flood peak than that of the circular watershed. The importance of watershed shape will be more a p parent after the concept of a time-area diagram is introduced and discussed in Chapter 9. A number of watershed parameters has been developed to reflect basin shape. The fol- lowing are a few typical parameters: 1. Length to the center of area (LC,): the distance in miles measured along the main chan- nel from the basin outlet to the point on the main channel opposite the center of area. The center of area for the watershed of Figure 3-3b is shown on the map. 2. Shape factor (L,): where L is the length of the watershed in miles. 3. Circularity ratio (F,): where P and A are the perimeter (ft) and area (ft2) of the watershed, respectively. 4. Circularity ratio (R,): where A, is the area of a circle having a perimeter equal to the perimeter of the basin. 5. Elongation ratio (Re): where L, is the maximum length (ft) of the basin parallel to the principal drainage lines. 110 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 The circularity ratios of Equations 3-3 and 3-4 are related by The length to the center of area is used in deriving Snyder's synthetic unit hydrograph of the HEC-1 computer program (see Chapter 9). The distance L, may be estimated by the mean distance from a graph of the cumulative area versus distance. As an alternative, LC,,c an be estimated by the distance measured along the principal channel to a point approximately opposite (i.e., measured perpendicular to) the center of area. The location of the center of area of the drainage area may be determined using another \"stone-age\" method of suspend- ing a cardboard outline of the drainage area by means of a straight pin inserted into the edge, drawing a vertical line, and then rotating the cardboard board approximately 90\" and draw- ing a second vertical line. The intersection of the two lines is the center of area of the water- shed. In practice, three lines rotated approximately 60\" may be used to provide a slightly greater level of accuracy. Example 3-5 For the watershed of Figure 3-3, the location of the center of area is shown on Figure 3-3b. Measuring along the channel to a point opposite the center of area, a value of 6400 ft is mea- sured for LC,T hus the shape factor L, is Values for the circularity ratios of Equations 3-3 and 3-4 can also be computed. The perimeter was measured as 26,500 ft; thus, from Equation 3-3, The equivalent area, A, (Equation 34), is Thus the value of the circularity ratio R, of Equation 3-4 is Example 3-6 Shape factors were originally developed because it was believed that they were correlated with peak discharge. To examine the association, seven hypothetical watersheds were evaluated using a time-area analysis (discussed in Chapter 9) and the peak discharge obtained from the linear- reservoir routed, time-area unit hydrograph. The watersheds and assumed contours are given in Figure 3-8, with the values of the parameters given in Table 3-2. The peak discharges (9,) were correlated with each of the five shape parameters (see Table 3-2). LC, and L, show negative cor- relations with q,.

{"paragraph": "3.3.6 Land Cover and Use During a brief rain shower, people will often take cover under a nearby tree; they recognize that the tree provides a temporary shelter since it intercepts rain during the initial part of the storm. It would seem to follow that a forested watershed would have less flood runoff than a watershed with no tree cover. Rooftop runoff provides another example of the effect of land cover on runoff rates and volumes. During a rainstorm it is obvious that flow from the downspouts on houses starts very shortly after the start of rain. Rooftops are impervious, steeply sloped, planar sur- faces, so there is little to retard the flow. Flow down a grassy hill of the same size as the rooftop will begin long after similar flow over a rooftop. The grassy hill sheds water at a slower rate and has a smaller volume because some of the water infiltrates into the topsoil and the grass is hydraulically rougher than the shingles on the roof. It would seem to follow from this example that flow from impervious surfaces would have greater volumes and smaller travel times than flow over pervious surfaces having similar size, shape, and slope characteristics. These two conceptual examples should illustrate that the land cover significantly af- fects the runoff characteristics of a watershed. When watershed characteristics other than the land cover are held constant, the runoff characteristics of a watershed, which includes the volume of runoff, the timing of runoff, and maximum flood flow rates, can differ signifi- cantly. Therefore, land cover and use serve as inputs for problems in hydrologic analysis and design. Many descriptors of land coverluse are used in hydrologic design. Most often, a quali- tative description of land cover is transformed into a quantitative index of runoff potential. set. 3.4 Soil Characteristics 113 For example, the Rational Method (see Chapter 7) uses a runoff coefficient C to reflect the runoff potential of a watershed. Larger values of C reflect increased runoff potential. The values for commercial properties (C = 0.75) have a greater runoff potential than residential areas (C = 0.3), which in turn has a greater runoff potential than forested areas (C = 0.15). From this it should be evident that the runoff potential increases as a watershed is trans- formed from a forested cover to an urban land cover. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) uses a different land coverluse index in their models than is used in the Rational Method. The runoff curve number (CN) is the SCS cover type index. It is an integration of the hydrologic effects of land use, soil type, and antecedent moisture. The runoff curve number is discussed in Section 3.7. Urban land covers are especially important in hydrology. Many hydrologic design problems result from urban expansion. The percentage of imperviousness is a commonly used index of the level of urban development. High-density residential areas characteristi- cally have percentages of imperviousness from 40% to 70%. Commercial and industrial areas are characterized by impervious cover often from 70% to 90%. Impervious covers in urban areas are not confined to the watershed surface.

Yet there are degrees of roughness as evidenced by the different grades of sandpaper. Surface rough- ness is also important in hydrologic design. As indicated in the previous section, a grass sur- face is hydrologically rougher then a shingled roof. The grass retards the flow to a greater ex- tent than the shingles. Manning's roughness coefficient (n) is the most frequently used index of surface roughness. While the units of n are rarely shown, its units are dependent on the dimension system used.

Particles of soil can be separated into three classes on the basis of the mean diameter (d) in millimeters: Clay: d < 0.002 rnrn Silt: 0.002 5 d 5 0.02 mm Sand: 0.02 5 d 5 2 mm Gravel is sometimes considered to be a fourth class, with gravel consisting of particles with diameters greater than 2 mm. Also, the sand class can be divided into coarse sand (0.2 to 2 mm) and fine sand (0.02 to 0.2 rnrn). The texture is further divided on the basis of the per- centage of each of these soil classes. Mineral particles have diameters (6) that typically fall into size ranges. While a number of classification systems have been proposed, Figure 3-9 shows the U.S. System for Texture Designations. The texture class can be determined from the percentages of sand, silt, and clay.

{"paragraph": "3.4.4 Volumetric Characteristics of Soils A geologic formation consists of solid matter, water, and air, with the water and air located in the spaces between the particles of the solid matter. For a volume V of the geologic forma- tion, there will be volumes of solid matter (V,), water (V,), and air (V,), such that The hydrologic response of a geologic formation will depend on the distribution of these vol- umes. Therefore, it is useful to define soil characteristics that depend on the volumetric dis- tribution of Equation 3-1 1. Pores or void space are part of geologic formations. The pores offer the opportunity for the passage of water. Therefore, the volumetric proportion of geologic formation that is void space is of importance in subsurface drainage. The porosity of a soil mass defines this volu- metric proportion, and thus it is an index of the water-bearing capacity of an aquifer. Specifi- cally, the porosity (P,) is given by in which V , is the volume of water that would be required to saturate the pore space, and V is the total volume of the geologic formation. Figure 3-10 shows typical values of the porosity. Where materials are mixed, the porosity is usually lower because the smaller particles tend to fill up the void space created by the material having the larger pore space. For example, if a 6 in.3 sample of soil is taken, poured into a graduated cylinder, and displaces 3.75 in.3 of water, then the porosity is Sec. 3.4 Soil Characteristics I Porosity FIGURE 3-1 0 Variation of specific retention, specific yield, and porosity 1 1 I I I I I I I I I 1 1 I L with the grain size for which the cumu- 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 lative total (starting with the coarsest 1 6 8 4 2 Maximum 10% Grain Size (mm) material) reaches 10% of the total. Water in a geologic formation may freely drain from the formation under the force of gravity. The proportion of the water that can drain under the force of gravity relative to the total volume is called the effective porosity, or specific yield (P,): in which Vgi s the volume of water drained by gravity. Some water in a geologic formation will not freely drain under the force of gravity be- cause of surface tension and molecular forces. The specific retention (R,) is the ratio of the volume of water retained by these forces to the total volume: in which V, is the volume of water retained by surface tension and molecular forces. The porosity, effective porosity, and specific retention are related by Figure 3-10 shows the porosity, specific yield, and specific retention for a range of soil tY Pes. The porosity does not fully characterize the ability of a geologic formation to pass water. The ability to pass water through a geologic formation also depends on the degree to which the pore spaces are connected. This ability is called the permeability of a soil. The term hydraulic conductivity is currently used to represent the permeability of a soil. A spe- cific measure of the permeability of a soil will be mathematically defined later. In addition to soil characteristics based on the volumetric proportions, the mass of a soil is an important characteristic. The bulk density is the mass of an oven dried soil per unit volume of the soil. After drying a soil mass, the bulk density p , is computed as w/v WIV -- y Pb = 62.4 lbjft Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 in which W is the weight of the soil (lb), V is the in situ volume of soil (ft3), and y is the spe- cific weight of water (lb/ft3). It is evident that p, is dimensionless and measures the density of the soil relative to the density of an equal volume of water. While the term specific yield applies to an unconfined aquifer, the underlying concept can be applied to a confined aquifer; however, the term storativity or storage coeficient is used when referring to the concept for a confined aquifer. Specifically, the storage coeffi- cient is the volume of water released from a confined aquifer when the pressure head de- creases by a unit depth over a unit horizontal area. Where a confined aquifer is subject to recharge, the storage coefficient would be defined by the water taken into a unit area of the aquifer per unit increase in the pressure head.

This characteristic is vital for understanding the potential of a soil to hold and transmit water."}, {"question": "In the context of soil characteristics, what is the difference between porosity and effective porosity (or specific yield)?", "answer": "Porosity refers to the total void space in a soil that can potentially hold water, while effective porosity or specific yield (P,) is the proportion of water that can drain under the force of gravity relative to the total volume. This distinction is important because not all water in a soil can freely drain due to surface tension and molecular forces."}, {"question": "How does the presence of mixed materials in a soil affect its porosity?", "answer": "When materials are mixed, the porosity is usually lower because the smaller particles tend to fill up the void space created by the material having the larger pore space. This reduction in porosity can impact the soil's ability to pass water, affecting its hydrologic behavior."}, {"question": "Why is specific retention important in understanding the hydrologic behavior of a geologic formation?", "answer": "Specific retention is the ratio of the volume of water retained by surface tension and molecular forces to the total volume, and it is crucial because it represents the water that will not freely drain under gravity. Understanding specific retention is essential for assessing the total water storage capacity of a geologic formation and predicting its response to changes in water levels or pressure."}, {"question": "In the context of confined aquifers, how does the concept of storativity or storage coefficient differ from specific yield in unconfined aquifers?", "answer": "The storativity or storage coefficient in confined aquifers refers to the volume of water released from the aquifer when the pressure head decreases by a unit depth over a unit horizontal area. This concept differs from specific yield in unconfined aquifers, which is the proportion of water that can drain under gravity.

Bulk density is dimensionless and can be used to compare the density of different soils."}, {"question": "How does the permeability of a soil, represented by hydraulic conductivity, influence its ability to pass water?", "answer": "The permeability of a soil, or its hydraulic conductivity, determines its ability to pass water through it.

{"paragraph": "3.4.5 Soil Moisture While water in the zone of saturation is referred to as ground water, water in the zone of aer- ation is referred to as soil moisture. During a storm, the upper layers of the zone of aeration may actually become saturated. After the rainfall ceases, the water in the zone of aeration is acted upon by gravitational, surface tension, and molecular forces. The drainage of water by gravitational forces will cease when the surface tension forces equal the force of gravity. The soil moisture content at this point is called the field capacity of the soil. Unfortunately, a spe- cific percentage cannot be specified to delimit field capacity. While most of the gravity water will drain from a soil mass in a few days, some water may continue to drain for months. Thus field capacity refers to the soil moisture content at which rapid drainage has ceased. Gravitational water is water that drains under the force of gravity prior to the time at which field capacity is reached. After field capacity has been reached, the soil moisture may continue to decrease be- cause of evaporation through the pores to the atmosphere or the removal of water by the roots of vegetation. As the soil moisture decreases, it becomes more difficult for plants to ob- tain the moisture that is necessary for sustaining growth. At this point, the plants start to wilt. This level of soil moisture where plants wilt and cannot sustain growth is called the perma- nent wilting point. Water below this level of soil moisture is referred to as unavailable water; the only moisture present in the soil is the thin film or layer of moisture attached to the soil particles, which is also referred to as hygroscopic moisture. Water that exists between field capacity and the permanent wilting point is also referred to as available water; it represents the available water supply, which is greatest for soil textures in the loam texture classes (see Figure 3-1 1). While soil moisture is not a principal factor in engineering design, it does have impor- tant implications in agriculture and forestry. Plants have varying needs for water during their growth cycle, and plant growth can be severely affected when the soil moisture content is in- adequate to meet the needs of the plants.

The process of water drainage under the force of gravity from a soil mass was de- scribed previously. As the gravitational water discharges from the soil mass, a film of mois- ture remains around the soil particles. This water film is held in place by surface tension forces, and the force of gravity is not sufficient to overcome the tension forces. This tension force is referred to as soil moisture tension or soil water suction. As the thickness of the film decreases, both the surface tension force and the curvature of the water film increase. The pressure of the air adjacent to the water film is atmospheric, with the pressure in the water film being less than atmospheric. This reduced pressure forms a suction force that prevents the water from draining under the force of gravity. In a saturated soil, the concepts of hydrostatic forces indicate that the pressure in- creases with depth, with the pressure being equal to zero at the water table. In the zone of aeration, where the water is held by surface tension forces, the water is at a pressure that is less then atmospheric. If we define our pressure datum to be zero for atmospheric pressure, the pressure of the water in the zone of saturation is positive, and the pressure of the water in the zone of aeration is negative. We know from elementary fluid mechanics that pressure forces represent a potential for doing work. Where the pressure is greater than atmospheric, work can be done by the fluid. Where the pressure is less than atmospheric, work must be done on the fluid. The negative pressure in the zone of aeration is referred to as the matric potential. The matric potential is measured using a tensiometer.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of soil moisture, what is the field capacity of the soil?", "answer": "The field capacity of the soil refers to the soil moisture content at which rapid drainage has ceased, occurring when the surface tension forces equal the force of gravity, and it is the point at which the soil moisture content is such that water is no longer draining under the force of gravity."}, {"question": "How does the process of water drainage under gravity influence the soil moisture content after a storm?", "answer": "After a storm, the upper layers of the zone of aeration may become saturated, and as the rainfall ceases, gravitational forces cause water to drain from the soil. This drainage continues until the surface tension forces equal the force of gravity, at which point the soil reaches its field capacity. The water that drains under gravity before reaching field capacity is known as gravitational water."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to specify a precise percentage for field capacity across different soils?", "answer": "It is challenging to specify a precise percentage for field capacity because the rate at which water drains from the soil can vary significantly. While most of the gravity water will drain from a soil mass in a few days, some water may continue to drain for months. This variability makes it difficult to define a specific percentage that universally delimits field capacity for all types of soil."}, {"question": "In the context of plant growth, what is the significance of the permanent wilting point?", "answer": "The permanent wilting point is the level of soil moisture at which plants begin to wilt and cannot sustain growth due to insufficient moisture. Below this point, the water in the soil is considered unavailable for plant use, existing only as a thin film of hygroscopic moisture attached to the soil particles. This point is critical for understanding the water needs of plants and managing soil moisture for agricultural and forestry purposes."}, {"question": "How does the concept of available water relate to soil texture and plant growth?", "answer": "Available water refers to the water that exists between the field capacity and the permanent wilting point. This water is crucial for plant growth as it represents the water supply that plants can utilize. The amount of available water is influenced by soil texture, with loam texture classes generally having the greatest available water supply. Understanding the relationship between available water, soil texture, and plant growth is essential for optimizing agricultural and forestry practices."}, {"question": "What is the role of surface tension forces in maintaining soil moisture?", "answer": "Surface tension forces play a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture by holding a film of moisture around the soil particles. This film, held in place by surface tension, prevents water from draining under the force of gravity once the soil has reached its field capacity. The surface tension forces increase as the thickness of the water film decreases, creating a suction force that retains moisture in the soil."}, {"question": "In the context of soil water suction, why does the pressure in the water film become less than atmospheric?", "answer": "The pressure in the water film becomes less than atmospheric due to the surface tension forces that hold the water in place. As the water film's thickness decreases, the curvature of the film increases, which enhances the surface tension force. This results in a reduced pressure within the water film compared to the atmospheric pressure, creating a suction force that prevents the water from draining under gravity."}, {"question": "How does the matric potential relate to the pressure of water in the zone of aeration?", "answer": "The matric potential is the negative pressure in the zone of aeration, where water is held by surface tension forces. This negative pressure is measured using a tensiometer and represents the potential for work to be done on the fluid to move it. In contrast to the positive pressure in the zone of saturation, the negative pressure in the zone of aeration indicates that work must be done to extract water from the soil, highlighting the challenges of water availability in this zone."}, {"question": "Why is understanding soil moisture content important for agricultural and forestry practices?", "answer": "Understanding soil moisture content is crucial for agricultural and forestry practices because plants have varying needs for water during their growth cycle. Inadequate soil moisture can severely affect plant growth, making it essential to manage soil moisture effectively. The root zone, extending only a few feet from the ground surface, is particularly important, as it is the primary area where plants absorb water and nutrients, emphasizing the need for precise management of soil moisture in this critical zone."}, {"question": "In the context of water availability, what is the distinction between available and unavailable water in soil?", "answer": "Available water refers to the water that exists between the field capacity and the permanent wilting point, which plants can utilize for growth.

This is because the soil's inability to absorb water quickly results in more water flowing over the surface instead of being absorbed, contributing to runoff. The implications of this are significant, as increased surface runoff can lead to erosion, flooding, and decreased water quality, highlighting the importance of understanding soil properties in hydrologic studies."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed characteristics, what role does infiltration capacity play in determining surface runoff?", "answer": "Infiltration capacity plays a crucial role in determining surface runoff, as it directly affects the amount of water that enters the soil profile versus the amount that flows over the surface as runoff. Soils with high infiltration capacities can absorb more water, reducing surface runoff, while those with low capacities increase the likelihood of runoff."}, {"question": "How does the infiltration capacity of soils impact the hydrologic cycle, particularly in terms of stream and river flow?", "answer": "The infiltration capacity of soils significantly impacts the hydrologic cycle by influencing the amount of water that enters streams and rivers. When soils have high infiltration capacities, more water is absorbed into the soil, eventually contributing to groundwater recharge and potentially reducing the peak flow rates in streams and rivers. Conversely, low infiltration capacities lead to increased surface runoff, which can result in higher peak flow rates and altered stream and river flow regimes. This highlights the complex relationship between soil properties, infiltration, and the broader hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "In the context of soil cover condition, why is understanding soil texture important for hydrologic studies?", "answer": "Understanding soil texture is important for hydrologic studies because it influences the infiltration capacity of the soil, which in turn affects the amount of surface runoff and the overall hydrologic balance.

Increased runoff can lead to erosion, flooding, and decreased water quality, posing challenges for water resources management. Effective management strategies must consider soil properties and infiltration capacities to mitigate these impacts, potentially through conservation practices that enhance soil health and increase infiltration rates. This not only helps in maintaining water quality but also in ensuring sustainable water resources for various uses, underscoring the need for integrated approaches that consider both hydrologic and soil science principles."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, how does the characterization of soil groups and their infiltration capacities contribute to predicting surface runoff?", "answer": "The characterization of soil groups and their infiltration capacities is crucial for predicting surface runoff in hydrologic modeling. By understanding the infiltration characteristics of different soil types, models can more accurately estimate the amount of water that will enter the soil profile versus the amount that will become surface runoff. This information is essential for predicting runoff volumes, peak flow rates, and the timing of runoff events, allowing for more informed decision-making in water resources management and flood control."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the relationship between soil texture and infiltration capacity in hydrologic studies?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the relationship between soil texture and infiltration capacity because this relationship fundamentally controls the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration, which in turn affects the entire hydrologic cycle. Understanding this relationship allows hydrologists to better predict how water will move through the landscape, influencing everything from groundwater recharge to stream flow, and is critical for managing water resources effectively and mitigating the impacts of flooding and drought."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed management, how can knowledge of hydrologic soil groups and their properties be used to reduce surface runoff and improve water quality?", "answer": "Knowledge of hydrologic soil groups and their properties can be used in watershed management to reduce surface runoff and improve water quality by identifying areas with low infiltration capacities and implementing practices that enhance soil health and increase infiltration rates. This might include conservation tillage, cover cropping, or the use of permeable pavements in urban areas, all of which can help to reduce runoff volumes and decrease the amount of pollutants entering waterways. By targeting interventions based on soil type and infiltration capacity, watershed managers can more effectively protect water resources and maintain ecosystem health."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.5.1 Channel Length In addition to the drainage area and the watershed length, the channel length is used fre- quently in hydrologic computations. Two computational schemes are used to compute the channel length: 1.

These sub- jective assessments can introduce an unknown degree of inaccuracy into the final design. It is important to know with certainty exactly which definition was used in the development of a design aid. For example, if the first definition was used in developing the design method, the use of the second definition in computing the channel length can introduce a bias into the design. For very small watersheds, the watershed may not include a stream channel; it may consist of a section of overland flow and a section where the flow is in a swale or gully. As the size of the watershed increases, channel flow dominates and the watershed and channel lengths are essentially the same. The design problem of interest will determine which length should be computed. Example 3-7 The channel system shown in Figure 3-3b can be viewed as consisting of three reaches. The lengths of the reaches in subareas 1, 2, and 3 are 4940, 2440, and 3670 ft, respectively. If the lengths are defined as subwatershed lengths, then the length measurements for subareas 1 and 2 must be extended to the basin divide, which is also shown in Figure 3-3b. The lengths of subwa- tersheds 1 and 2 are 6810 and 4875 ft, respectively. For subwatershed 3 the watershed length should be defined as the flow path from the most distant point on the watershed divide to the outlet. For subwatershed 3 this point would be the northern most point, which is on the boundary separating subareas 2 and 3. This flow path consists of 2550 ft of channel and 2450 ft of over- land and gully flow for a total watershed length of 5000 ft. The importance of distinguishing be- tween the channel length and the length of the subwatershed will be evident when discussing time parameters. If one was not distinguishing between the subwatersheds and was interested in the total watershed length, the length would be the sum of the channel length for the reach through subarea 3 (for example, 3670 ft) and the watershed length of subarea 1 (i.e., 6810 ft), or 10,480 feet.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic computations, what is the significance of channel length?", "answer": "Channel length is used frequently in hydrologic computations, alongside drainage area and watershed length, and its accurate measurement is crucial for design aids and avoiding bias in design methods."}, {"question": "How do subjective assessments in defining channel length impact hydrologic design?", "answer": "Subjective assessments in defining channel length, such as determining the endpoint of the channel based on map drawings, can introduce an unknown degree of inaccuracy into the final design, potentially leading to bias if different definitions are used in developing and applying design methods."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to distinguish between channel length and subwatershed length in hydrologic analyses?", "answer": "Distinguishing between channel length and subwatershed length is essential because it affects the computation of time parameters and the overall understanding of watershed dynamics.

Furthermore, understanding drainage density can help hydrologists and water resource managers to better comprehend the complex relationships between watershed characteristics, stream networks, and hydrological processes, ultimately informing more effective management strategies."}, {"question": "How does the example provided in the paragraph demonstrate the importance of drainage density calculation?", "answer": "The example demonstrates the importance of drainage density calculation by illustrating how the value of drainage density can be significantly affected by the accuracy of channel network delineation. The example shows that even with a simplified channel network, a drainage density value can still be calculated, but the result may not be representative of the true drainage density. This highlights the need for careful consideration of channel network delineation when calculating drainage density, as it can have a substantial impact on the accuracy and reliability of the results."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what are the implications of using drainage density values?", "answer": "The implications of using drainage density values in hydrological modeling are significant, as they can influence the accuracy of storm response predictions and flood risk assessments. Drainage density values can be used to parameterize hydrological models, allowing for more realistic simulations of watershed behavior. However, the challenges associated with deriving consistent estimates of drainage density due to map dependency can limit the reliability of these models. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the accuracy of drainage density values and consider the potential implications for model performance and decision-making."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to derive consistent estimates of drainage density?", "answer": "Deriving consistent estimates of drainage density is challenging due to the map dependency, which refers to the reliance on accurate and detailed mapping of the channel network. The accuracy of the channel network delineation can significantly impact the calculated drainage density value, and small errors or inconsistencies in the mapping can lead to substantial differences in the estimated drainage density. This challenge highlights the need for high-quality mapping data and careful consideration of the limitations and uncertainties associated with drainage density estimates."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed management, how can drainage density inform decision-making?", "answer": "Drainage density can inform decision-making in watershed management by providing insights into the storm response characteristics of a watershed. For instance, a watershed with a high drainage density may require more frequent or intensive flood management strategies, whereas a watershed with a low drainage density may be more susceptible to drought. By considering drainage density, water resource managers can develop more effective management plans that account for the unique characteristics of the watershed, ultimately leading to better outcomes for water resource management and flood risk reduction."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of using drainage density as a hydrological metric?", "answer": "The limitations of using drainage density as a hydrological"}]}
{"paragraph": "3.5.4 Horton Horton developed a set of \"laws\" that are indicators of the geomorphological characteristics watersheds.- he of stream order is a measure of the degree of stream branching within a wa- tershed. Each length of stream is indicated by its order (for example, first-order, second- order, etc.). A first-order stream is an unbranched tributary, and a second-order stream is a tributary formed by two or more first-order streams. A third-order stream is formed by two or more second-order streams, and in general, an nh-order stream is a tributary formed by - two or more streams of order (n-1) and streams of lower order. For a watershed, the princi- Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology (el (c) (d1 FIGURE 3-13 Identification of stream orders (a) and delineation of stream areas for first- order (b), second-order (c), third-order (d), and fourth-order (e) streams. pal order is defined as the order of the principal channel (for example, the order of the tribu- tary passing through the watershed outlet). The ordering of streams with a hypothetical wa- tershed is shown in Figure 3-14. For this case, the watershed has a principal order of 4. The concept of stream order is used to compute other indicators of drainage character. The bifurcation ratio (Rb)i s defined as the ratio of the number of streams of any order to the number of streams of the next higher order. Values of Rb typically range from 2 to 4. Figure Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 FIGURE 3-14 Ordering of stream of watershed having a principal order of 4. 3-15 displays the same watershed as in Figure 3-14, but the streams of each order have been specifically delineated. Figure 3-15a shows that there are seventeen first-order streams, with Figure 3-15b to d indicating 6, 2, and 1 streams of orders 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This yields bifurcation ratios of 2.83, 3.0, and 2.0 for stream orders 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4, re- spectively, and an average value of 2.6. Law of stream numbers. Horton also proposed the law of stream numbers, which relates the number of streams of order i (Ni)t o the bifurcation ratio and the principal order (k): For a watershed with a bifurcation ratio of 2.6 and a fourth-order principal stream, Equation 3-23 becomes Thus the law of stream numbers would predict 18, 7, and 3 streams of order 1, 2, and 3, re- spectively; these agree closely with the 17, 6, and 2 streams for the watershed of Figures 3-14 and 3-15. Law of stream lengths. The law of stream lengths relates the average length of streams of order i (L,) to the stream length ratio (r,) and the average length of first-order streams (El): Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology (a) First-order streams (b) Second-order streams FIGURE 3-1 5 Stream-order separation (d) Fourth-order stream for estimating the bifurcation ratio. (c) Third-order streams where the stream length ratio is defined as the average length of streams of any order to the average length of streams of the next lower order. Law of stream areas. The law of stream areas is similar to the law of stream lengths. Specifically, the law relates the mean tributary area of streams of order i (Ai) to the (A,) mean drainage area of fnst-order basins and the stream area ratio (r,): XI Ai = (3-26) where the stream area ratio is the average basin area of streams of one order to the average area of basins of the next lower order. The similarity in Equations 3-25 and 3-26 reflects the high correlation that exists between watershed length and area. Law of stream slopes. The law of stream slopes relates the average slope of streams of order i (S,) to the average slope of first-order streams (s,) and the stream slope ratio (r,): Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 where the stream slope ratio is the average slope of streams of order j to the average slope of + streams of the next higher order, j 1. Example >I0 To illustrate the estimation of the three geomorphic parameters R,, r,, and r,, the stream order for each reach of the channels in a 280-mi2 watershed were delineated. The delineation of Figure 3-13a indicates a fourth-order principal stream. There are 38, 16, 4, and 1 streams of order 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; these values can be substituted into Equation 3-10 to get the following: Equations 3-28 can be solved for R,, using the principle of least squares. Taking the natural log- arithms of both sides of Equation 3-23 yields Using the principle of least squares, it is easily shown that the least squares estimate of In$, is given by x [('ne Ni) (k- j)I In$, = x [(k - i)2] in which each summation is over the range from i = 1 to i = (k-1), where k is the principal order. Thus, applying Equation 3-30 to the values of Equations 3-28 yields an estimate of 3.58 for R,. Thus the law of stream orders has the following form for the watershed of Figure 3-13: The length of each stream segment was measured, with average lengths of 1.86, 2.79, 6.42, and 12.0 miles for streams of orders 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The stream length ratio for Equation 3-25 can be determined using the concepts behind the development of Equation 3-30; however, because the form of Equation 3-25 is slightly different from that of Equation 3-23, the resulting equation is different: z, E [(In, - In, z,)(i - I)] In, r, = X [(i - where each of the summations is over all values of i from 2 to the principal order for the water- shed. For the case of Figure 3-13 the resulting stream length ratio is 1.83, which yields the fol- lowing law of stream lengths: The area draining each of the subwatersheds for the basin of Figure 3-13 was computed. The average area for streams of each order were computed as 4.1, 4.4, 9.1, and 18.1 mi2 for stream orders of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The delineation of these areas is given in Figure 3-13b to e. The least squares estimate of the stream-area ratio (r,) of Equation 3-26 can be com- puted from the following: xi X [(Ine - In, xl)(i - I)] In, r, = 2 [(i - I ) ~ ] Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology 127 where each of the summations is over all values of i from 2 to the principal order of the water- shed. For this watershed, the stream area ratio is 1.55, which yields the following law of stream areas: xi 2, = (1.55)'-' (3-55) This example illustrates the case of analysis. Where a watershed is not fully defined, re- gional estimates of the three parameters (R,, r,, and r,) can be obtained using regional averages. For the analysis case, then, it would be necessary to make similar analyses on many watersheds in the region and compute average values of the parameters.

This law is significant as it provides a method to estimate the number of streams of different orders within a watershed, which can be useful for hydrologic synthesis and analysis.

In the given example, the principle of least squares is applied by taking the natural logarithms of both sides of the equation relating the number of streams of each order to the bifurcation ratio and the principal order, and then solving for Rb using the least squares method.

Regional estimates can be obtained by analyzing many watersheds in the region and computing average values of the parameters. These regional averages can then be used as a substitute for the specific watershed, allowing for hydrologic synthesis and analysis to be performed.

{"paragraph": "3.5.5 Channel Cross Sections Channel cross sections are a very important part of hydrologic analysis and design for a number of reasons. Many types of design problems require cross-section information, in- cluding the cross-sectional area. The wetted perimeter, slope, roughness, and average veloc- ity are other important characteristics. It is only necessary to walk beside a river or stream to recognize that, even over short distances, stream cross sections can take on a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Small streams in upland areas often have V-shaped cross sections. As the stream drains larger areas, past floods have sculptured out larger, often rectangular or trapezoidal sections. Many rivers have cross sections that consist of a relatively small V- or U-shaped channel that carries the runoff from small storms and the runoff during periods between storm events. This small channel area is often part of a much larger flat area on one or both sides of the channel; this flat area is called the floodplain, which is the area that is covered with water during times of higher discharges. A river cross section is shown in Figure 3-16. The low-flow cross section is ap- proximately trapezoidal; however, it represents a small portion of the total cross section that is used to pass large flood events. The floodplain has low side slopes and could easily be rep- resented as a rectangular section. Because of channel instability and erosional processes cross sections can change shape during flood events, and where such changes take place, they should be accounted for in developing a hscharge rating table. Channel cross sections can also change because of development within the floodplain. Figure 3-16 shows the cross section after a bridge was built. While the low-flow section remains unchanged, the width of the section was decreased because of the abutments on each side and the four twin piers that support the bridge.

The calculations of water surface profiles are usually performed using hydraulic computations in computer programs such as the Corps of Engineers' HEC-2 or the Soil Conservation Service's WSP-2. In practice, design problems require the calculation of flood surface elevations along the entire section of the channel affected by the structure.

The characteristics of the channel cross section can significantly impact the hydraulic calculations and the overall design of hydraulic structures."}, {"question": "How do the shapes and sizes of stream cross sections change as the stream drains larger areas?", "answer": "As a stream drains larger areas, its cross section changes from a V-shaped profile, typical of small streams in upland areas, to larger, often rectangular or trapezoidal sections, sculpted out by past floods. This change in cross section shape and size is a result of the increased discharge and the erosional processes that occur as the stream flows through the landscape.

For example, the construction of a bridge can reduce the cross-sectional area of the channel, leading to increased average velocities or flood surface elevations. This, in turn, can impact the flood profile both above and below the bridge, requiring adjustments to the design of hydraulic structures and flood protection measures.

In the context of flood profile calculations, the continuity equation is used to determine the relationship between the cross-sectional area, average velocity, and discharge. By applying the continuity equation, hydrologists can predict how changes in the channel cross section, such as those caused by bridge construction, will impact the flood profile and make necessary adjustments to the design of hydraulic structures."}, {"question": "What are the implications of channel cross section changes for the design of hydraulic structures, such as bridges?", "answer": "Changes in channel cross sections, whether due to natural processes or human activities, can have significant implications for the design of hydraulic structures, such as bridges.

{"paragraph": "3.5.6 Channel Roughness The roughness of a surface affects the characteristics of runoff, whether the water is on the 1 surface of the watershed or in the channel. With respect to the hydrologic cycle, the rough- I ness of the surface retards the flow. For overland flow, increased roughness delays the runoff I and should increase the potential for infiltration. Reduced velocities associated with in- 1 creased roughness should also decrease the amount of erosion. The general effects of rough- ness on flow in a channel are similar to those for overland flow. FIGURE 3-17 Plan view of site of proposed rail structure with existing and devel- oped condition 100-ye ar floodplains. Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology 129 Manning's roughness coefficient (n) is required for a number of hydraulic computa- tions. It is a necessary input in floodplain delineation. Also, a number of methods for esti- mating the timing of runoff use n as an input. It is also used in the design of stable channel systems. Thus it is an important input. A number of methods exist for estimating the roughness coefficient. First, books that provide a series of pictures of stream channels with a recommended n value for each picture are available; thus for any natural channel a value of n can be obtained by comparing the roughness characteristics of the channel with the pictures and using the n value from the pic- ture that appears most similar. Second, there are tables (for example, see Table 3 4 ) t hat give typical or average values of n for various channel conditions. However, the accuracy of n values from such tables are highly dependent on the degree of homogeneity of channel con- ditions and the degree of specificity of the table. The picture comparison and tabular look-up methods are used frequently because of their simplicity and because studies have not shown them to be highly inaccurate. A third method is available that is potentially more accurate than either of the two methods discussed previously. The method involves the selection of a base value of n and then correcting the base value for each of the following five factors: 1. The degree of regularity of the surfaces of the channel cross section. 2. The character of variations in the size and shape of cross sections. 3. The presence and characteristics of obstructions in the channel. 4. The affect of vegetation on flow conditions. 5. The degree of channel meandering. This method is basically a table look-up solution, with the basic n value and each of the corrections obtained from a table. Each of the steps is outlined below. The basic n value represents a minimum of retardance due to friction. The corrections for the five factors attempt to correct a basic value for their af- fect on the turbulence of flow. The five corrections add to the basic n value, with a larger value of n indicating greater turbulence and retardance. Step I: Select Basic CoefJicient (nl). The basic n values of Table 3-5, are assumed to be for a channel having a straight and uniform cross section, with the sides and bottom sur- faces cut into the natural material. This \"basic\" cross section has no vegetation on the bottom or sides. Step 2: Correction for Channel Irregularity (n2). The basic n assumes that the channel surfaces are the best (i.e., least retarding) obtainable for the materials involved. As the degree of irregularity increases, the turbulence and retardance is expected to in- crease. Thus the modifying value (n,) increases as the degree of irregularity increases (see Table 3-6). Step 3: Correction for Cross-Section Variation (n,). The basic roughness value n as- sumes that the cross section has a relatively constant size and shape throughout the channel reach. As the size and shape of the channel changes, the degree of retardance increases, and 130 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 TABLE 3-4 Recommended Design Values of Manning Roughness Coefficients, iza Manning n Rangeb I.

Where this procedure is not followed, the table may be used as a guide. The values of n tabulated have been derived from data reported by C.E. Ramser (see footnote c) and for other incomplete data. m e te ntative values of n cited are principally derived from measurements made on fairly short but straight reaches of natural streams. Where slopes calculated from flood elevations along a considerable length of channel, involving meanders and bends, are to be used in velocity calculations by the Manning formula, the value of n must be increased to provide for the additional loss of energy caused by bends. The increase may be in the range of perhaps 3% to 15%. The presence of foliage on trees and brush under flood stage will materially increase the value of n. Therefore, roughness co- efficients for vegetation in leaf will be larger than for bare branches. For trees in channels or on banks, and for brush on banks where submergence of branches increases with depth of flow, n will increase with rising stage.

Obstructions, such as debris deposits, tree stumps and exposed tree roots, and large rocks and boulders, increase turbulence. In assess- ing the degree to which n, should be modified to reflect the effect of obstructions, the follow- ing factors should be considered: (1) the degree to which the obstructions occupy or reduce the average cross-sectional area; (2) the character of the obstructions (sharp-edged or angular objects induce greater turbulence than curved, smooth-surfaced objects); and (3) the position and spacing of obstructions transversely and longitudinally in the reach. The basic value n, assumes no obstructions, so the correction n, is applied to increase the n value for the pres- ence of obstructions. Values of n, can be obtained from Table 3-8. Step 5: Correctionf or Vegetation (n,). The basic value n, assumes that the channel is devoid of vegetation. Since vegetation increases the surface roughness of the channel, the TABLE 3-5 Roughness Coefficient Modifier (n,) Character of Channel Basic n Channels in earth 0.02 Channels cut into rock 0.025 Channels in fine gravel 0.024 Channels in coarse gravel 0.028 Source: Cowan, 1956.

The values of n, in Table 3-9 can be used to modify the value of n, for the presence and character of vegetation in the channel. In selecting a value of n,, it is necessary to reflect on the time of year (for example, growing season condition versus dormant season condition). Addition- ally, the following factors should be considered: (1) the height of the vegetation with respect to the depth of flow; (2) the ability of the vegetation to resist bending under the force of the flowing water; (3) the degree to which the vegetation occupies the flow path within the chan- nel; and (4) the transverse and longitudinal variation of vegetation of different types, densi- ties, and heights. 134 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 TABLE 3-9 Roughness Coefficient Modifier (n,) Vegetation and Flow Degree of Range in Conditions Comparable to: Effect on n Modifying Value Dense growths of flexible turf grasses or weeds, of which Bermuda grass and blue- Low 0.0054.010 grass are examples, where the average depth of flow is two or more times the height of the vegetation.

Step 6: Correction for Channel Meandering The basic value n, assumes a (12,). straight channel reach. The degree of meandering can be measured using the ratio of the total meander length of the channel in the reach (1,) to the straight length of the reach (1,). Table 3-10 provides values of n, for selected ranges of the ratio 1,/1,. The value of n, is also a func- tion of the value n,, which is the sum of the values of n, to n,. If values of l,, and 1, are not readily available, the degree of meandering can be judged with the ordinal scale of minor, appreciable, or severe. Step 7: Computation of Reach n. The value of the reach roughness coefficient equals the sum of the values of the basic value n, and the modifying values n, to n,. The calcula- tions can be performed on the computation sheet of Table 3-1 1. Further considerations in estimating n. Tables 3-7 to 3-9 include ranges of values for modifying n values. For example, Table 3-8 gives a range for n, from 0.04 to 0.06 Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology TABLE 3-10 Roughness Coefficient Modifier (n,) Ratio of Meander Length to Straight Length Degree of Meander Modifying Value\" 1.0-1.2 Minor 1.2-1.5 Appreciable 1.5 and greater Severe ans=nl+ n2+n3+n4+n5 Source: Cowan, 1956. for \"severe\" obstructions. The use of ranges for modifying values reflects both the inaccu- racy of the tabled values and recognition that the effect of obstructions will vary from site to site. Recognition of these complicating factors does not simplify the task of selecting a repre- sentative value from the given range. Unless one has convincing documentation for selecting another value, the mean of the range is probably the best choice for a value. The five factors for which corrections are provided are intended to reflect independent effects on flow retardance or roughness. In practice, channel conditions may suggest an in- TABLE 3-1 1 Computation Sheet for Manning's Roughness Coefficient Description Recommended Actual Variable Alternatives Value Value Basic, n, Earth Rock Fine gravel Coarse gravel Irregularity, n, Smooth Minor Moderate Severe Cross section, n3 Gradual Occasional A1 ternating Obstructions, n, Negligible Minor Appreciable Severe Vegetation, nj Low n5 = Medium High Very high Subtotal n, = Meanderirg, n, Minor n6 = Appreciable Severe Total = Reach n = Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 terdependence of these factors. For example, dense vegetation may be seen as obstructions, and obstructions may contribute to irregularity of the channel cross section. Where interde- pendencies are evident in evaluating n for a stream reach, every effort should be made to de- tennine the primary factor and use that factor to modify the value of n,. Double counting will lead to biased estimates of n, with the bias suggesting an overly rough channel. It should be of interest to examine the sensitivity of the final n value to the various channel conditions that produce the value. In examining the basic value n,, relatively little scatter exists among the values, with a range of 0.008. Thus variation in the final value of n will not be sensitive to the underlying natural material. A mean value of about 0.025 could be used with little loss of accuracy. However, the actual value from Table 3-3 should be used. For all of the correction factors except meandering, it should be evident from the val- ues summarized on the worksheet (Table 3-1 1) that vegetation is the dominant factor. Not only does thls factor have the largest possible correction (0.10) but the ranges of the values are relatively large. Thus the final value of n will be most sensitive to the accuracy of the vegetation adjustment. Obstructions have the next greatest potential for effect, with an effect that is approximately one-half the effect of vegetation. The range for the corrections for ir- (4 regularity (n,) and cross section are relatively small when compared with the ranges pro- vided for obstructions (n,) and vegetation (n,); thus for many channels the irregularity and cross-section adjustments will not be dominant factors. The sensitivity of n to meandering can be appreciable, especially if a large value of the subtotal roughness coefficient n, results because of large values of either n, or n,. Using approximate mean values for both n, and n, of 0.02 and 0.04, respectively, severe meandering would equal about 0.025 because of n,, n,, and n, alone. This correction is larger than the maximum values of both n, and n,;.thus me- andering can be a sensitive factor. Example 3-1 1 The example in Table 3-12 was obtained from a U.S. Department of Agriculture publication. It serves not only as an example of the estimation of numbers but also as an illustration of the type of data that must be observed to estimate n. While a value could possibly be estimated from de- tailed photographs of the channel, a site visit is highly recommended (probably an absolute ne- cessity). The example of Table 3-12 is based on a case where n has been determined so that comparison between the estimated and actual n can be shown. The method of Tables 3-5 to 3-10 suggests a value of 0.11, while computations from actual flow conditions yield values of 0.095 and 0.104, respectively; these represent errors of 15.8% and 5.8%, respectively. These er- rors are well within the tolerances suggested from the range of n values given for each of the conditions of Table 3-4.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of channel roughness, how does the roughness of a surface affect the characteristics of runoff?", "answer": "The roughness of a surface affects the characteristics of runoff by retarding the flow, whether the water is on the surface of the watershed or in the channel. For overland flow, increased roughness delays the runoff and increases the potential for infiltration. Reduced velocities associated with increased roughness also decrease the amount of erosion."}, {"question": "Why is Manning's roughness coefficient (n) an important input in hydraulic computations?", "answer": "Manning's roughness coefficient (n) is an important input in hydraulic computations because it is required for a number of calculations, including floodplain delineation, estimating the timing of runoff, and designing stable channel systems. Its accuracy is crucial as it directly affects the outcome of these computations, making it a necessary input for reliable results."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating Manning's roughness coefficient, what methods exist for determining the roughness coefficient?", "answer": "There are several methods for estimating the roughness coefficient, including comparing the roughness characteristics of the channel with pictures in books and using the recommended n value from the most similar picture, using tables that provide typical or average values of n for various channel conditions, and a more detailed method involving the selection of a base value of n and then correcting it for factors such as channel irregularity, cross-section variation, obstructions, vegetation, and meandering."}, {"question": "How does vegetation affect the roughness coefficient in channel flow?", "answer": "Vegetation increases the surface roughness of the channel, thus the value of n must be increased to reflect the increased roughness due to vegetation. The degree of this increase depends on factors such as the height of the vegetation with respect to the depth of flow, the ability of the vegetation to resist bending under the force of the flowing water, and the degree to which the vegetation occupies the flow path within the channel. Tables, such as Table 3-9, provide values of n, for modifying the value of n, for the presence and character of vegetation in the channel."}, {"question": "In the context of channel meandering, why is it necessary to correct the basic roughness coefficient value?", "answer": "The basic roughness coefficient value assumes a straight channel reach, but meandering increases the turbulence and retardance of flow. The degree of meandering can be measured using the ratio of the total meander length of the channel to the straight length of the reach, and this ratio is used to correct the basic roughness coefficient value. This correction is necessary because meandering can significantly affect the flow characteristics and the accuracy of hydraulic computations."}, {"question": "What are the implications of interdependencies among the factors used to correct the basic roughness coefficient value?", "answer": "The factors used to correct the basic roughness coefficient value, such as channel irregularity, cross-section variation, obstructions, vegetation, and meandering, can be interdependent. For example, dense vegetation may be seen as obstructions, and obstructions may contribute to irregularity of the channel cross section. It is essential to identify the primary factor and use that factor to modify the value of n to avoid double counting, which can lead to biased estimates of n. This requires careful evaluation of channel conditions and consideration of how these factors interact to affect flow retardance or roughness."}, {"question": "How does the sensitivity of the final roughness coefficient value to various channel conditions affect the estimation process?", "answer": "The sensitivity of the final roughness coefficient value to various channel conditions, such as vegetation, obstructions, irregularity, and meandering, can significantly affect the estimation process. Vegetation is often the dominant factor, with the potential for the largest correction, and its accuracy is crucial. Obstructions have the next greatest potential for effect, followed by meandering, especially in cases where the subtotal roughness coefficient is large due to significant vegetation or obstructions. Understanding these sensitivities is essential for making informed decisions during the estimation process and for recognizing the potential impacts of errors or uncertainties in the input values."}, {"question": "In the context of applying Manning's roughness coefficient in practice, what challenges or considerations arise from the use of ranges for modifying values?", "answer": "The use of ranges for modifying values, as seen in tables such as Table 3-8, reflects both the inaccuracy of the tabled values and the recognition that the effect of factors like obstructions will vary from site to site. This presents a challenge in selecting a representative value from the given range, as it requires careful consideration of the specific channel conditions and the potential interdependencies among factors. Unless there is convincing documentation for selecting another value, using the mean of the range is often recommended as the best choice for a value, highlighting the need for professional judgment and experience in applying these methods in practice."}, {"question": "Why is a site visit highly recommended for estimating Manning's roughness coefficient?", "answer": "A site"}]}
{"paragraph": "3.5.7 Uniform Flow Computations Given the complexity of flood runoff processes, both overland and channel flow, it is neces- sary to make a number of assumptions in hydrologic design work. It is quite common to as- sume that flood runoff can be described using equations developed for uniform flow condi- tions. Uniform flow exists when both the depth of flow and the flow rate (discharge) are constant with distance either along the flow path for overland flow or for every section in a channel reach. Although one could argue that this is not a valid assumption during flooding, Sec. 3.5 Channel Geomorphology 137 TABLE 3-12 Calculation of Manning's Roughness Coefficient: Example 3-1 1 - Channel: Camp Creek dredged channel near Seymour, Illinois.

Bull. 129, Plate 29-C for photograph and Table 9, p. 86, for data. the assumption permits necessary simplifications. Also, it has not been shown that the as- sumption of uniform flow leads to incorrect hydrologic designs. In uniform flow, the energy grade line, the water surface, and the channel bottom are parallel to each other; that is, the slopes of the three are equal. As indicated, flow characteris- tics (discharge, flow depth, velocity distribution, and cross-sectional area) are constant along the flow path. If these conditions exist, the resistance of the channel cross section will equal and be opposite to the force component due to gravity. To develop an equation that can be used to describe uniform flow, a force diagram of an incremental section of the flow regime will be used. Figure 3-18 shows a force diagram for an increment section of length Ax. For the body of fluid in the section, the following forces must be considered: (1) the weight of the water W, (2) the hydrostatic pressure forces, F, and F2, which act on each end of the section; and (3) the friction force Ff of the channel cross section on the water. Summing forces in the x direction yields + Wsin 0 F, - F, - Ff = 0 Recognizing that the hydrostatic forces are equal and that the weight of the water in the sec- tion equals yAAX yields in which y is the specific weight of the water and A is the cross-sectional area of the flow. For small slopes sin@ is approximately equal to the bed slope So. Since for uniform flow the depth is constant, the slopes of the energy grade line (EGL) and hydraulic grade line (HGL) equal the bed slope; thus Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 I I Datum Section Section FIGURE 3-18 Force diagram for uni- 1 2 form flow conditions. The friction force Ffequals the product of the shear stress, and the surface contact area be- 7, tween the flow path and the water. The contact area equals the wetted perimeter P times the length of the flow path AX. Chezy showed that the shear stress is proportional to the velocity squared. Thus the friction force is given by where Cf is a proportionality constant. Substituting Equation 3-39 into Equation 3-38 and solving for the velocity yields V = CR,0, .5p.5 (3-40) in whlch R, is called the hydraulic radius (in ft) and equals AIP, and C is a constant called the Chezy coefficient.

Manning's roughness coefficient plays a crucial role in this context by providing a quantitative measure of the channel's resistance to flow, allowing designers to adjust the computation of flow velocity and discharge accordingly. Vegetation's impact on flow resistance is reflected in the value of Manning's roughness coefficient, with higher values indicating greater resistance."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what are the implications of assuming uniform flow conditions for flood runoff processes, and how might this assumption impact design outcomes?", "answer": "Assuming uniform flow conditions for flood runoff processes implies that the design may not fully capture the complexities of actual flood events, potentially leading to inaccuracies in predicted flow characteristics. However, this assumption is often necessary for simplifying computations and has not been shown to lead to incorrect hydrologic designs.

{"paragraph": "3.6 TRAVEL TIME Most hydrologic designs involve some measure of a flood discharge. Discharges have units of volume per time (L~/T)s uch as ft3/sec, m3/sec, or acre-ftlday. Various watershed and hydrometeorological characteristics can be used to reflect the volume of flood runoff; Sec. 3.6 Travel Time 139 for example, the product of the drainage area and the depth of rainfall gives a volume of water that is potentially available for runoff. But volume alone is not adequate for many design problems. As the dimensions of discharge indicate, time is an important element in hydrologic design. A given volume of water may or may not present a flood hazard; the hazard will depend on the time distribution of the flood runoff. If a significant portion of the total volume passes a given location at about the same time, flood damages will occur. Conversely, if the total volume is distributed over a relatively long period of time, flood damages may be minimal. In some cases, instantaneous inundation causes major damages, such as when an automobile is submerged. Short-duration inundation of an agricultural- crop field does not usually cause major damage. Duration of flooding is an important factor. Because of the importance of the timing of runoff, most hydrologic models require a watershed characteristic that reflects the timing of runoff. A number of time parameters have been developed. While the timing of runoff is a characteristic of a watershed, time parame- ters are formulated as a function of other watershed characteristics and, in some cases, rain- fall intensity. A number of time parameters are commonly used with hydrologic and hydraulic mod- els, including the time of concentration, the time lag, and reach travel time. Why is time an important input to hydrologic and hydraulic models? Recognizing that this is a somewhat philosophical question from a hydrologic design standpoint, it may still be worthwhile to consider three types of hydrologic design problems. For designs on small watersheds, such as for the design of either rooftop drains or street-drainage inlets, the time parameter may be an indicator of the intensity and volume of rainfall and the degree to which the rainfall will be attenuated; a short time period would suggest little attenuation of the rainfall intensity be- cause the storages of the hydrologic processes have minimal effects. For designs on larger watersheds, time parameters may be indicators of watershed storage and the effect of storage on the time distribution of runoff. Watershed storage directly affects the shape and the time distribution of the runoff hydrograph. For designs where the time variation of flood runoff is routed through channel reaches, the reach travel time reflects the effect of channel storage on the attenuation of the flood discharge. Errors in a time parameter will cause errors in designs based on the time parameter. As much as 75% of the total error in an estimate of the peak discharge can result from errors in the estimated value of the time parameter. Recognizing the importance of time parameters in hydrologic design and evaluation, hydrologists have developed numerous methods for esti- mating the various time parameters. Unfortunately, most of the empirical formulas have been based on very limited data. Their applicability is constrained by the lack of diversity in the data; an empirical estimation method should be used with considerable caution either for wa- tersheds having characteristics different from those of the watersheds used to calibrate the method or for watersheds in other geographic regions. Both uses represent extrapolation of data. Thus a design engineer, when faced with a design problem requiring an estimate of a time parameter, must choose from among many of the alternatives and often apply the time parameter with little or no knowledge of its accuracy. The most frequently used time parameters are the time of concentration, the lag time, the time to peak, the time to equilibrium, and the time-area curve. Time parameters are usu- ally defined in terms of either the physical characteristics of a watershed or the distribution of rainfall excess and direct runoff.

{"paragraph": "3.6.1 Definitions There are two commonly accepted definitions of the time of concentration. First, t, is defined as the time required for a particle of water to flow hydraulically from the most distant point in the watershed to the outlet or design point; methods of estimation based on this definition use watershed characteristics, and sometimes a precipitation index such as the 2-yr, 2-hr rainfall intensity. A number of empirical equations that are based on this definition will be discussed herein. The second definition is introduced here only for completeness because some of the terms have not been previously introduced. In the second definition, the t, is based on a rain- fall hyetograph (defined in Chapter 4) and the resulting runoff hydrograph (defined in Chap- ter 9). From the actual hyetograph and hydrograph, the rainfall excess and direct runoff are computed. The time of concentration is the time between the center of mass of rainfall excess and the inflection point on the recession of the direct runoff hydrograph. As an alternative, t, is sometimes computed as the time difference between the end of rainfall excess and the in- flection point. This definition is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. It is recognized that both methods of estimating t, do not provide either the true value or reproducible values of I,. Methods based on watershed characteristics may assume, for ex- ample, that Manning's Equation is always valid and that the roughness coefficient applies throughout the flow regime. Ignoring both the difficulties in selecting a single value of the roughness coefficient for a seemingly homogeneous flow regime and the assumption that the hydraulic radius remains constant, one must still contend with the problem of reproductibil- ity of the input; that is, different users of a method would select different values of the input variables even when applying the method on the same drainage area. In summary, while the time of concentration is an important input to hydrologic design, it is neither a highly accu- rate input nor highly reproducible. Obtaining t, estimates from rainfall and runoff data suffers from some difficulties. Uni- versally accepted methods of separating either base flow from direct runoff or losses from rainfall excess do not exist. Both of these separation requirements can introduce significant variation in estimated t, values. In using rainfall and runoff data to estimate t,, one must also recognize and adjust for factors such as antecedent soil moisture, intermittent rainfall pat- terns, nonlinearities in the convolution process, and variation in the recurrence intervals of the storm. In summary, every designer should recognize that a single correct method for esti- mating t, is not possible, and therefore, the true value can never be determined.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what is the significance of the time of concentration?", "answer": "The time of concentration is an important input to hydrologic design, although it is neither highly accurate nor highly reproducible."}, {"question": "How do methods based on watershed characteristics estimate the time of concentration?", "answer": "These methods use watershed characteristics and sometimes a precipitation index, such as the 2-yr, 2-hr rainfall intensity, and are based on empirical equations."}, {"question": "Why do methods of estimating the time of concentration based on watershed characteristics lack reproducibility?", "answer": "Methods based on watershed characteristics lack reproducibility because they assume Manning's Equation is always valid, and the roughness coefficient applies throughout the flow regime.

{"paragraph": "3.6.2 Classifying Time Parameters A system for classifying time parameters is helpful because numerous empirical formulas have been developed. Almost all of the methods are based on four types of input: slope, wa- tershed size, flow resistance, and water input. These characteristics are either for the over- land flow portion of the watershed, the pipe system, or the channel system. Methods for overland flow can be further subdivided into sheet flow and concentrated flow methods. Sec. 3.6 Travel Time 141 Methods for estimating time parameters can be distinguished on the basis of both their input requirements and dominant flow regime. The classification system presented here (Table 3-13) could be further separated on the basis of the time parameters (for example, time of concentration, time lag, or time to peak); however, this additional separation criterion will not be used because the time of concentration is of primary interest herein. Methods that are intended to predict the time of concentration for watersheds on which overland flow dominates can include variables to represent each of the four input types. Measures of the overland-flow resistance include Manning's roughness coefficient, n; the runoff coefficient of the Rational Method, C; the SCS runoff curve number, CN; the percent- age of imperviousness, I; or a qualitative descriptor of the land cover type. Any one of a number of size and slope parameters can be used to represent the length and slope of over- land flow. A rainfall parameter, such as the 2-yr, 24-hr rainfall depth, is sometimes used as input to indicate the effect of the surface runoff availability on the time of travel. Methods for estimating t, that include channel characteristics as input variables should be used when channel flow makes a significant contribution to the total travel time of runoff (see Table 3-13). Manning's roughness coefficient, n, is the most widely used index of channel-flow resistance. Espey and Winslow developed a coefficient to indicate the degree of channelization, which could also be an indicator of flow resistance. Several slope and size parameters are used as variables, with the length and slope of the main channel being the most frequently used. The input factor for a channel can be represented by one of several variables, including the precipitation intensity, the volume of surface runoff, and the hy- draulic radius for bankfull flow. For many small urban watersheds, the timing characteristics of the runoff are con- trolled by a pipe system (see Table 3-13). Thus methods for predicting time parameters on such watersheds should include one or more input variables that reflect the physical charac- teristics of the pipe system. Manning's roughness coefficient for the pipe could be used to re- flect flow resistance. The input could be represented by the maximum flow rate, q,, the largest or smallest pipe diameter, or the mean hydraulic radius of the pipe system. Any one of a number of size variables could be included in these equations to represent size. The slope of the pipe is obviously the variable used to represent slope. The classification system given in Table 3-13 can be used for classifying time parame- ter prediction methods. Whlle some prediction methods will fall into one of the four classes TABLE 3-1 3 Criteria for Classifying Time Parameters and Variablesa Commonly Used to Represent the Input Type Input Type Flow Watershed Water Flow Regime Resistance Size Slope Input Sheet flow n L S I Concentrated flow n, C, CN L, A S I Channel 4 4 L ~L*1& 8s+ SC,S ,CLX, Rh, i, Q Pipe n L S Rh. qp 'Variables are defined in the Notation. 142 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 based on flow regime, a significant number of others will have to be identified as a \"mixed\" method (i.e., one that includes variables reflecting different flow regimes). For example, de- signs required for urbanized watersheds that include both a significant pipe system and over- land flow may require a time-parameter model that includes variables that reflect all four flow regimes: sheet flow, concentrated flow, channel flow, and pipe flow. In practice, terminology is not always applied consistently; therefore, it is worthwhile clarifying some common terms associated with the time of concentration. The term overland flow could be applied to a number of flow regimes. It is, however, worthwhile separating this into sheet flow and concentrated flow. Sheet flow occurs in the upper reaches of a watershed, usually over very short flow paths. Typically, this is evident on steeply sloped paved sur- faces, where it appears as shallow layers, often with small waves. A lunematic wave equa- tion is usually used to compute travel times for sheet flow. After some distance, topography usually causes the flow to concentrate in rills, then swales or gutters, and then gullies. This is referred to as concentrated flow. Either Manning's Equation or the velocity method is com- monly used to estimate travel times of concentrated flow. Manning's Equation is used to estimate velocities of overland flow, both sheet flow and concentrated flow. It can be shown that the lunematic-wave equation for estimating sheet-flow travel time is based on Manning's Equation with the assumption that the hydraulic radius equals the product of the rainfall intensity and the travel time. The velocity method for concen- trated flow uses Manning's Equation with an assumed depth and Manning's n. Frequently used curves of velocity versus slope are valid only as long as the assumed depth and n are accurate.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}, {"question": "In the context of classifying time parameters in hydrology, what are the primary input types used in empirical formulas?", "answer": "The primary input types used are slope, watershed size, flow resistance, and water input, which can apply to overland flow, pipe systems, or channel systems."}, {"question": "How do methods for estimating time parameters in overland flow differ from those in channel flow?", "answer": "Methods for overland flow can be further subdivided into sheet flow and concentrated flow methods, whereas channel flow methods include variables such as Manning's roughness coefficient, channel length, and slope, reflecting the characteristics of the channel system."}, {"question": "Why is it important to distinguish between sheet flow and concentrated flow in the context of overland flow?", "answer": "Distinguishing between sheet flow and concentrated flow is important because they occur in different parts of a watershed and are modeled differently. Sheet flow occurs in the upper reaches, typically on steeply sloped surfaces, and is often computed using a lunematic wave equation. Concentrated flow, which occurs after the flow has been concentrated into rills, swales, or gutters, can be estimated using Manning's Equation or the velocity method. This distinction is crucial for accurately estimating travel times and understanding the hydrological processes at play."}, {"question": "In the context of urban watersheds, how do pipe systems influence the timing characteristics of runoff?", "answer": "Pipe systems can significantly control the timing characteristics of runoff in urban watersheds. To predict time parameters in such watersheds, methods should include input variables that reflect the physical characteristics of the pipe system, such as Manning's roughness coefficient for the pipe, maximum flow rate, pipe diameter, and hydraulic radius. This is because the flow through pipes can dominate the travel time of runoff, especially in areas with extensive urban infrastructure."}, {"question": "What is the role of Manning's roughness coefficient in estimating travel times for different flow regimes?", "answer": "Manning's roughness coefficient (n) plays a crucial role in estimating travel times for various flow regimes, including overland flow (both sheet and concentrated flow), channel flow, and pipe flow. It is used to represent flow resistance and is a key variable in equations such as Manning's Equation, which estimates velocities of overland flow, and in methods predicting travel times for concentrated flow and channel flow."}, {"question": "How do the characteristics of the land cover type influence the estimation of time parameters?", "answer": "The characteristics of the land cover type can influence the estimation of time parameters through measures such as Manning's roughness coefficient (n), the runoff coefficient of the Rational Method (C), the SCS runoff curve number (CN), and the percentage of imperviousness (I). These parameters help to represent the overland-flow resistance and are used in various methods to estimate time parameters, reflecting how different land covers affect runoff and travel times."}, {"question": "In the context of mixed flow regimes, such as those found in urbanized watersheds, what challenges arise in selecting appropriate time-parameter models?", "answer": "Urbanized watersheds often present a challenge because they can include a mix of flow regimes, such as sheet flow, concentrated flow, channel flow, and pipe flow. Selecting an appropriate time-parameter model for such watersheds requires considering variables that reflect all these regimes. This can be complex because different models may be suited to different parts of the watershed, and the terminology is not always applied consistently, leading to potential confusion in model selection and application."}, {"question": "Why is clarifying terminology important in the context of hydrological time parameters?", "answer": "Clarifying terminology is important because terms like \"overland flow\" can be applied to several flow regimes, and without clear distinctions, there can be confusion. For instance, separating overland flow into sheet flow and concentrated flow helps in choosing the appropriate method for estimating travel times. Consistent terminology ensures that hydrologists and engineers can accurately communicate and apply the correct methods for different hydrological conditions."}, {"question": "How does the choice of input variables affect the estimation of time parameters in hydrological models?", "answer": "The choice of input variables significantly affects the estimation of time parameters. Different flow regimes require different input variables to accurately represent the characteristics of the watershed or pipe system. For example, channel flow models may include variables like Manning's roughness coefficient, channel length, and slope, while pipe flow models might include the pipe's roughness coefficient, diameter, and hydraulic radius. The selection of appropriate input variables is crucial for the accuracy of time parameter predictions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not accounting for the specific flow regime in estimating travel times?", "answer": "Not accounting for the specific flow regime can lead to inaccurate estimates of travel times. Each flow regime (sheet flow, concentrated flow, channel flow, pipe flow) has distinct characteristics and requires specific methods and input variables for accurate modeling. Failure to recognize these differences can result in poor predictions of runoff timing,"}]}
{"paragraph": "3.6.3 Velocity Method The velocity method is based on the concept that the travel time (T,) for a particular flow path is a function of the length of flow (L) and the velocity (V): in which T,, L, and V have units of rnin, ft, and ft/sec, respectively. The travel time is com- puted for the principal flow path. Where the principal flow path consists of segments that have different slopes or land cover, the principal flow path should be divided into segments and Equation 3 4 3 should be used for each flow segment. The time of concentration is then the sum of the travel times: in which k is the number of segments and the subscript i refers to the flow segment. The velocity of Equation 3 4 3 is a function of the type of flow (sheet, concentrated flow, gully flow, channel flow, pipe flow), the roughness of the flow path, and the slope of the flow path. A number of methods have been developed for estimating the velocity. Flow velocities in pipes and open channels can be computed using Manning's Equation: Sec. 3.6 Travel Time 14 3 in which V is the velocity (fdsec), n is the roughness coefficient, R, is the hydraulic radius (ft), and S is the slope (fdft). Values of n for overland-flow surfaces are given in Table 3-3. Values of n for channels can be obtained from either Table 3-4 or through the computation of Cowan's method (Table 3-1 1). Equation 3-45 can be simplified so that V is only a function of the slope by assuming values for n and R,. This gives a relationship between the velocity and the average slope of the surface: in which V is the velocity (fdsec) and S is the slope (fdft). Thus, k equals 1.486~;'~ln. For Equation 3-46, the value of k is a function of the land cover with the effect measured by the value of n and R,. Values for selected land covers are given in Table 3-14. These are shown in Figure 3-19. Equation 3-46 and Figure 3-19 are a simplification of Manning's Equation (Equation 3-45). Values were assumed for n and R, and used to compute the values for k for Equation 3-46. Other curves could be developed for different flow regimes by selecting val- ues for n and R,. The assumed values of n and R, are given in Table 3-14. After short distances, runoff tends to concentrate in rills and then gullies of increasing proportions.

Alternatively, the average velocity can be obtained using Equation 3-46 or Figure 3-19, where values are given for grassed waterways, unpaved gullies, and paved areas. Flow in gullies empties into channels or pipes. Open channels are assumed to begin where either the blue stream shows on USGS quadrangle sheets or the channel is visible on aerial photographs. Cross-section information (for example, depth-area and roughness) should be obtained for all channel reaches in the watershed. Manning's Equation or water surface profile information can be used to estimate average flow velocities. The velocity should be computed for normal depth, which varies with the magnitude of the storm. Flows with return periods from 1.5 to 3 years often represent bank-full conditions, with flows greater than bankfull causing inundation of the floodplain.

This simplification enables the use of a single equation to estimate travel time for different land covers, with values of k (which equals 1.486 * n^(-1/3) * R^2/3) provided for various land covers in Table 3-14. However, this simplification may not accurately capture the complexities of real-world flow regimes, and other curves could be developed for different flow regimes by selecting alternative values for n and R."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to estimate travel time in areas with varying land cover and flow regimes?", "answer": "Estimating travel time in areas with varying land cover and flow regimes is challenging because the velocity of flow is affected by the type of flow, roughness of the flow path, and slope of the flow path. Different land covers have different roughness coefficients (n) and hydraulic radii (R), which affect the velocity and travel time. Additionally, the flow regime can change over short distances, with runoff concentrating in rills and gullies, and eventually emptying into channels or pipes, making it necessary to consider multiple flow paths and regimes when estimating travel time."}, {"question": "In the context of channel flow, how is the average flow velocity computed?", "answer": "The average flow velocity in channels can be computed using Manning's Equation or water surface profile information.

For example, forested areas tend to have higher roughness coefficients than grassed areas, resulting in lower velocities and longer travel times."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.6.4 Sheet-Flow Travel Time At the upper reaches of a watershed, runoff does not concentrate into well-defined flow paths, such as gullies or swales. Instead it flows over the surface at reasonably uniform, shal- low depths. Hydrologically speaking, h s i s sheet flow. It is evident on long, sloping streets during rainstorms. After some distance, the flow begins to converge into concentrated flow paths that have depths noticeably greater than that of the shallow flow. The distance from the upper end of the watershed or flow surface to the point where significant concentrated flow begins is termed the sheet-flow length. For steeply sloped, impervious surfaces the sheet- flow length can be several hundred feet. For shallow slopes or for pervious surfaces concen- trated flow will begin after relatively short sheet-flow lengths. In the upper reaches of a watershed, sheet-flow runoff during the intense part of the storm will flow as a shallow layer with a reasonably constant depth. An equation, referred to as the kinematic wave equation for the equilibrium time, can be developed using Manning's equation with the assumption that the hydraulic radius equals the product of the rainfall in- tensity and the travel time, for example, R, = i T,. Using the velocity equation of Equation 3-43 with the travel time equal to the time of concentration, Manning's Equation becomes in which i [=I in./hr, T, [=I min, S [=I ft/ft, and L [=I ft. Solving for the travel time yields Equation 3-47 requires the rainfall intensity i for the time of concentration. Since T, is not initially known, it is necessary to assume a value of T, to obtain i from a rainfall IDF curve (see Figure 4-4) and then compute Ti. If the initial assumption for T, was incorrect, then a new estimate of i is obtained from the IDF curve using the computed value of T,. The itera- tive process should be repeated until the value of T, does not change. To by-pass the necessity to solve Equation 3-47 iteratively, Welle and Woodward (1986) assumed a power-model relationship between rainfall intensity and rainfall duration. Using a return period of two years, they substituted the 2-yr, 24-hr rainfall depth for the rain- fall intensity i and derived the following alterative model for Equation 3-47: in which L is the flow length (ft), S is the average slope (ft/ft), P, is the 2-yr, 24-hr rainfall depth (in.) and T, [=I min. Equation 3-48 has the important advantage that an iterative solu- tion is not necessary. The n values for use with Equations 3-47 and 3-48 are given in Table 3-3 and are for very shallow flow depths, 0.1 ft or so; these values reflect the effects of rain drop impact; drag over plane surfaces; obstacles such as litter, crop ridges, and rocks; and erosion and transportation of sediment. The rainfall depth P2 for Equation 3-48 can be obtained from an IDF curve such as Figure 4-4. Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 In addition to the previously mentioned assumptions, these kinematic equations make the following assumptions: (1) no local inflow; (2) no backwater effects; (3) no storage ef- fects; (4) the discharge is only a function of depth, for example, q = uyb; and (5) planar, non- converging flow. These assumptions became less realistic for any of the following condi- tions: the slope decreases, the surface roughness increases, or the length of the flow path increases. Recognizing that Equations 3-47 and 3-48 can yield unusually long times of con- centration, limits are often, somewhat arbitrarily, placed on flow lengths. Common length limits are from 100 ft to 300 ft. TR-55 (SCS, 1986) places a limit of 300 ft on Equation 3-48; however, many feel that this is too long and a shorter length of 100 ft should be used. This limit would not necessarily apply to Equation 3-47. However, it should be recognized that the five assumptions given above can be violated for the other inputs, n and S. Empirical evi- dence (McCuen and Speiss, 1995) suggests that Equation 3-47 (but not Equation 3-48) should only be used for flow conditions where the term n ~ l f eiq uals approximately 100. For a given n and S, the allowable length can be estimated as 100 9.5n-1. Example 3-12 Consider a short-grass surface of 120 ft in length and at a slope of 0.2%, or 0.002 ft/ft. Assume that the local drainage policy requires use of a 10-yr return period for design. Manning's rz for short grass is 0.15 (see Table 3-3). When using Equation 347, an estimate of TI is used to ob- tain i from Figure 4-4. In this example, a T, of 5 min is assumed; thus, the initial estimate of the intensity is 8 in./hr, which gives the following estimate of the sheet-flow travel time: 0.938 [0 .15 (120) ] 0 .6 34.28 -- 34.28 = i 0.4 (0.002)0.5 = io.4 -(8)o,4 = 14.9 min. Since this is substantially greater than the initial estimate of 5 min, the revised travel time of 15 min is entered into Figure 4-4 to obtain a new estimate of the intensity, which is 5.1 in./hr. This produces a new estimate of T,: 34.28 TI = --- = 17.9 min. (5.1)0.4 Another iteration produces i = 4.7 in./hr and T, = 18.5 min. A final iteration yields i = 4.6 in./hr and T, = 18.6 min. As an alternative, the SCS kinematic wave equation could be used. From Figure 4-4, the 2-yr, 24-hr intensity is 0.13 in./hr, which yields a P, of 3.12 in. Thus, Equation 3 4 8 y ields 0.42 [0 .15 (120) ] = 28.8 min = (3.12)O.~ 0.002~,~ This is substantially greater than the 18.6 min obtained with Equation 3-47. The difference be- tween the two estimates is due in part to the return period used and the structural coefficients of the two equations. Example 3-13 The data of Table 3-15 can be used to illustrate the estimation of the time of concentration with the velocity method. Two watershed conditions are indicated: pre- and post-development. In the pre-development condition, the 4-acre drainage area is primarily forested, with a natural channel having a good stand of high grass. In the post-development condition, the channel has been elim- inated and replaced with a 15-in.-diameter pipe.

For the slopes given in Table 3-15, the velocities are 0.25 and 1.40 ftfsec, respectively. For the roadside channel, the velocity can be estimated using the equation for concentrated flow in an unpaved gully, which has a k of 23.5. Thus, the velocity is 2.1 ftfsec. The pre-development time of concentration can be computed with Equation 3 4 : 140 260 480 + + + + tc = - - --- = 560 186 229 = 975 sec = 16.2 min 0.25 1.4 2.1 For the post-development conditions, the flow velocities for the first three segments can be de- termined from Equation 3-46 and Table 3-14. For the slopes given in Table 3-15, the velocities for the first three segments are 0.21,2.08, and 1.40 ftfsec, respectively. Assuming Manning's co- efficient of 0.01 1 for the concrete pipe, the full-flow velocity is A slope of 0.009 ftfft is used since the meandering roadside channel was replaced with a pipe, which resulted in a shorter length of travel and, therefore, a larger slope. Thus the time of con- centration is = 238 + 24 + 214 + 71 = 547 sec = 9.1 min Thus the land development decreased the time of concentration from 16.2 min to 9.1 rnin.

The characteristics of each section are given in Table 3-16, including the land uselcover, slope, and length. Equation 3-46 is used to compute the velocity of flow for section A to B: Thus, the travel time, which is computed with Equation 3-43, is Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 FIGURE 3-20 Time of concentration estimation: (a) principal flow path for existing conditions; (b) principal flow path for developed conditions. 500 ft T, = = 12.6 min 0.661 ft/sec (60) For the section from B to C, Manning's Equation is used.

The hydraulic radius is Thus, the velocity is and the travel time is 3600 ft Tt = = 12.6 min 4.78 ft/s (60) Thus, the total travel time is the sum of the travel times for the individual segments (Equation 3-44): + + t, = 12.6 19.1 12.6 = 44.3 min For the developed conditions, the principal flow path is segmented into five parts (see Figure 3-20b). For the first part of the overland-flow portion, the runoff is sheet flow; thus, the kinematic wave equation (Equation 3-47) is used. An initial time of concentration of 5 rnin is as- sumed and used with the 2-yr IDF curve to estimate the intensity: Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 Thus, Equation 3-47 yields a revised estimate of the travel time: 0.938 (0 .013 (80) 5 )06 = 1.12 rnin T, = Since this differs from the initial estimate of 5 rnin, the intensity is recomputed from the IDF re- lationship. A value of 6.09 in./hr results, which then yields a revised travel time of 1.1 rnin, which is used as the value for this part of the flow path because it is essentially the same as the travel time of 1.12 rnin computed after the first iteration. For the section from F to G, the flow path consists of grass-lined swales. Equation 3-43 can be used to compute the velocity: Thus, the travel time is L 400 ft T = - = -- - 1.6 rnin V 4.15 ft/sec (60) For the segment from G to H, the principal flow path consists of paved surface and gut- ters. Thus, Equation 3-43 with Table 3-15 is used: and the travel time is 900 ft T, = --- = 2.3 min 6.55 ft/sec (60) The segment from H to J is a 18-in. pipe. Thus, Manning's equation is used. The full-flow hydraulic radius is one-fourth the diameter (D/4),s o the velocity for full flow is and the travel time is L T = - = 1950 ft = 5.1 min V 6.33 ft/sec (60) The final section J to K is an improved trapezoidal channel. The hydraulic radius is Manning's Equation is used to compute the velocity: and the travel time is L 2950 ft T = - - = = 5.7 rnin V 8.57 ft/s (60) Thus, the total travel time through the five segments is the post-development time of con- centration: Sec. 3.6 Travel Time + + + + tc = C. T, = 1.1 1.6 2.3 5.1 5.7 = 15.8 min The tc for developed conditions is 36 % of the tc for the existing conditions. Example 3-15 For large watersheds, the overland flow processes are less important than the channel processes when estimating times of concentration. The contribution of the upland-area overland flow to the overall time of concentration can usually be neglected. Therefore, the principal flow path is usu- ally taken as channel segments that are homogeneous in roughness, slope, and flow depth. Man- ning's Equation is used to compute the velocities in the segments of the principal flow path. While the roughness and slope are obtained in the conventional way, the hydraulic radius must be estimated. The bankfull discharge rate is usually used with the station rating curve, if avail- able, or a regional relationship between flow depth and discharge, if necessary. The hydraulic ra- dius is approximated by the depth of flow. Consider the following data for a 52-mi2 watershed: A S L d Station (mi2) n (fUft) (ft) (ft) The drainage area is the total area upstream of the station. The channel length L is the length be- tween stations. The depth (4,w hich is used as the hydraulic radius, was estimated from a re- gional equation that related depth and drainage area: Manning's equation is used to compute the velocity, and Equation 3-43 is used to compute the reach travel times (T,): v =t Station (~Ps) (hr) Therefore, the time of concentration, which equals the sum of the travel times, is 4.65 hours.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}, {"question": "In the context of sheet-flow travel time, what is the significance of the sheet-flow length, and how does it vary with surface characteristics?", "answer": "The sheet-flow length is the distance from the upper end of the watershed or flow surface to the point where significant concentrated flow begins. It varies with surface characteristics such as slope and perviousness; for steeply sloped, impervious surfaces, the sheet-flow length can be several hundred feet, while for shallow slopes or pervious surfaces, concentrated flow begins after relatively short sheet-flow lengths."}, {"question": "How does the kinematic wave equation for the equilibrium time account for rainfall intensity and travel time in sheet flow?", "answer": "The kinematic wave equation for the equilibrium time, such as Equation 3-47, accounts for rainfall intensity and travel time by assuming the hydraulic radius equals the product of the rainfall intensity and the travel time. This relationship allows for the calculation of travel time based on rainfall intensity, which can be obtained from a rainfall IDF curve, and requires iterative solutions to converge on a stable value of travel time."}, {"question": "Why are limits often placed on flow lengths in equations like 3-47 and 3-48, and what are the implications of these limits?", "answer": "Limits are placed on flow lengths because equations like 3-47 and 3-48 can yield unusually long times of concentration. Common length limits are from 100 ft to 300 ft, with TR-55 placing a limit of 300 ft on Equation 3-48. However, many argue that this is too long and a shorter length of 100 ft should be used. These limits are crucial because they affect the estimated time of concentration, which in turn impacts design and planning decisions in hydrology and water resource management."}, {"question": "In the context of the velocity method for estimating time of concentration, how are velocities of flow for different segments of the principal flow path determined?", "answer": "Velocities of flow for different segments of the principal flow path are determined using equations such as 3-46 for overland flow and Manning's Equation for channel flow. The choice of equation depends on the type of flow (overland, grassed waterway, paved, etc.) and the characteristics of the flow path segment, including slope, length, and roughness coefficients."}, {"question": "What are the assumptions underlying the kinematic wave equations for sheet flow, and under what conditions do these assumptions become less realistic?", "answer": "The kinematic wave equations for sheet flow assume no local inflow, no backwater effects, no storage effects, that discharge is only a function of depth, and planar, non-converging flow. These assumptions become less realistic when the slope decreases, surface roughness increases, or the length of the flow path increases. Recognizing these limitations is essential for applying these equations appropriately and interpreting their results accurately."}, {"question": "How does land development affect the time of concentration in a watershed, as illustrated by the examples provided?", "answer": "Land development can significantly affect the time of concentration in a watershed. For instance, in Example 3-13, the development of a watershed changed the flow path characteristics, reducing the time of concentration from 16.2 minutes to 9.1 minutes. This reduction is due to changes in surface roughness, slope, and the introduction of more efficient flow paths like pipes, which increase the velocity of flow and thus decrease the travel time."}, {"question": "Why is the iterative process necessary when using Equation 3-47 to solve for travel time, and how does this process account for the relationship between rainfall intensity and travel time?", "answer": "The iterative process is necessary because the travel time (Tc) is initially unknown, and the rainfall intensity (i) required for the equation is dependent on Tc. The process involves assuming a value of Tc, obtaining i from a rainfall IDF curve, and then computing a new Tc. This cycle repeats until the value of Tc stabilizes, ensuring that the solution accounts for the dynamic relationship between rainfall intensity and travel time accurately."}, {"question": "In the context of large watersheds, why is the contribution of upland-area overland flow to the overall time of concentration often neglected, and what method is used instead to estimate the time of concentration?", "answer": "For large watersheds, the contribution of upland-area overland flow to the overall time of concentration is often neglected because channel processes dominate. Instead, the principal flow path is considered to be channel segments that are homogeneous in roughness, slope, and flow depth. Manning's Equation is used to compute velocities in these segments, with the hydraulic radius approximated by the depth of flow, often estimated from a regional equation or station rating curve."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.6.5 Empirical Formulas Nine empirical methods of estimating t, will be reviewed. Not all the methods were origi- nally presented as equations for computing the time of concentration; therefore, it was neces- sary to adjust the empirical equations so that they would compute t, in hours. For those meth- 152 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 ods designed to predict the lag time, the computed lag values were multiplied by a constant; the value of the constant depended on the definition of the lag. A value of 1.417 was used for the lag defined as the time difference between the centers of mass of rainfall excess and di- rect runoff, determined on the basis of the relationship between the time lag and the time of concentration for a SCS triangular hydrograph. This assumption is probably unimportant; that is, the results of comparisons are insensitive to this assumption. A conversion factor of 1.67 was used for methods in which the lag was defined as the time difference between the center of mass rainfall excess and the peak discharge; this constant was also based on analy- sis of a triangular hydrograph. Again, the use of this conversion factor would not be expected to affect the accuracy of the methods. The Carter lag equation for partially sewered watersheds. Using data from the Washington, D.C., area, Carter (1961) calibrated an equation for predicting the wa- tershed lag for watersheds that have natural channels and partially sewered land uses. The length (L, in mi) and slope (S,, in ftlmi) variables in the equation should be measured from the longest channel: in which tc is the time of concentration (min). The data that were used to calibrate the equa- tion included watersheds less than 8 mi2 in area, with channel lengths less than 7 mi and slopes less than 2%. Manning's coefficients for the channels varied between 0.013 and 0.025. While the input variables reflect the channel characteristics, one must assume that the coefficients reflect a significant amount of pipe flow because the watersheds were in urban- ized areas and the Manning's n suggest a concrete surface. The Eagleson lag model. Eagleson (1962) presented an equation for predicting the time between the center of gravity of the rainfall excess and the peak of direct runoff; Equation 3-50 includes a factor for converting the time lag to a time of concentration: in which Lj is the hydraulic length (ft), R, is the hydraulic radius (ft), Sj is the slope of the principal flowpath (ftlft), and tc is the time of concentration (min). The original equation was calibrated from data for watersheds less than 8 mi2. The variables that were used in calibrat- ing the model were computed using the characteristics of the sewer system. The length, slope, and n value are for the main sewer, while R, is for the main channel when flowing full. This is a \"mixed method. The Espey-Winslow equation. Espey and Winslow, as reported by Schultz and Lopez (1974) and Espey et al. (1966), calibrated an equation for predicting the time to peak using data measured in Houston from 1964 to 1967. Six of the seventeen watersheds were predominately rural; the remaining were urbanized. The watersheds ranged in size from 1 to 35 mi? The length and slope variables were measured from the channel. The channelization + factor was designed to measure subjectively the hydraulic efficiency of the drainage net- + work. The value of is the sum of two parts, one indicating the amount of channel vegeta- tion and the other indicating the degree of channel improvement. The impervious area factor Sac. 3.6 Travel Time 153 represents the resistance of the overland flow portion of the travel time. Equation 3-51 in- cludes a coefficient to convert the model from a time to peak to a time of concentration equation: tc = 31+ ~ y~9~ 0 . 1 14-05.6 (3-5 1) in which LC is the channel length (ft), Sc is the channel slope (ftlft), I is the percent impervi- ousness, and tc is the time of concentration (min). Because it includes variables for both overland and channel flow, it is considered to be a \"mixed method. Federal Aviation Agency equation. Equation 3-52 was developed from airfield drainage data (FAA, 1970): in which C is the Rational Formula runoff coefficient, L is the flow length (ft), S is the slope (ftlft), and tc is the time of concentration (min). Thus it is probably most valid for small wa- tersheds where sheet flow and overland flow dominate. The length, slope, and resistance variables are for the principal flow path. Kerby-Hathaway formula. Kerby (1959) calibrated Equation 3-53 for computing the time of concentration on very small watersheds in which surface flow dominated: in which L is the flow length (ft), Sc is the slope (ftlft), and tc is the time of concentration (min). The length used in the equation is the straight-line distance from the most distant point of the watershed to the outlet and is measured parallel to the slope until a well-defined chan- nel is reached. Watersheds of less than 10 acres were used to calibrate the model; the slopes were less than 1%, and Manning's n values were 0.8 and less. Consider the similarities be- tween Equations 3-53 and 3-47. Kirpich's methods. Kn-pich (1940) calibrated two equations for computing the time of concentration (min) for small watersheds in Pennsylvania: ~p~~ tc = 0.0013 s;O '. (3-54) and Tennessee: s ; ~ ~ ~ ~ tc = 0.0078 L : ~ ~ The length (ft) and slope (ft/ft) parameters in the equations are for the channel. The Tennessee watersheds ranged in size from 1 to 112 acres, with slopes from 3 to 10%. The computed times of concentration should be multiplied by 0.4 and 0.2 for watersheds where the overland flow path is either concrete or asphalt and the channel is concrete lined, respectively. The SCS lag formula. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) provided an equation for estimating the watershed lag, which was defined as the time in hours from the center of 15 4 Watershed Characteristics Chap. 3 mass of the excess rainfall to the peak discharge. They also indicate that the time of concen- tration equals 1.67 times the lag. Thus, tc in min is in which L is the watershed length (ft) and S is the watershed slope (ftlft). Equation 3-56 is intended for use on watersheds where overland flow dominates and was developed for nonurban watersheds. The SCS had recommended that the lag equation be used for homoge- neous watersheds 2000 acres and less. The method primarily reflects concentrated flow. While the 1986 TR-55 does not include this formula, it was shown by McCuen et al. (I 984) to provide accurate estimates of tc up to 4000 acres. The Van Sickle equation. Van Sickle provided a time-to-peak equation cali- brated from data collected in Houston, with drainage areas less than 36 mi'. The equation is based on two length variables; the first, L, (mi), is the total length of all drainageways and storm sewers greater than 36 in. in diameter, while the second, L, (mi), is the total basin length. The prediction equation reflects both channel and pipe flow; thus it is a \"mixed\" method. Equation 3-57 includes a factor for converting the time-to-peak equation to one for predicting the time of concentration: in which Sf is the slope (ftfft) and tc is the time of concentration (min).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of estimating the time of concentration, what empirical methods are reviewed, and how do they differ in their approach?", "answer": "The paragraph reviews nine empirical methods for estimating the time of concentration, including the Carter lag equation, Eagleson lag model, Espey-Winslow equation, Federal Aviation Agency equation, Kerby-Hathaway formula, Kirpich's methods, SCS lag formula, and Van Sickle equation. These methods differ in their approach, with some focusing on channel characteristics, others on overland flow, and some combining both, hence classified as \"mixed methods.\" The differences in approach reflect the variety of hydrological conditions and watershed characteristics they are designed to accommodate."}, {"question": "Why are conversion factors used in some empirical methods to adjust the computed lag values to obtain the time of concentration?", "answer": "Conversion factors are used in some empirical methods because the original equations were designed to predict the lag time, not the time of concentration directly. For instance, a value of 1.417 is used for the lag defined as the time difference between the centers of mass of rainfall excess and direct runoff, based on the relationship between the time lag and the time of concentration for a SCS triangular hydrograph. This adjustment allows for the estimation of the time of concentration from lag time predictions."}, {"question": "How do the channelization and impervious area factors in the Espey-Winslow equation influence the estimation of the time of concentration?", "answer": "The channelization factor in the Espey-Winslow equation is designed to measure the hydraulic efficiency of the drainage network, taking into account the amount of channel vegetation and the degree of channel improvement. The impervious area factor represents the resistance of the overland flow portion of the travel time. These factors are crucial because they allow the equation to account for both overland and channel flow characteristics, making it a \"mixed method\" that can be applied to a variety of watershed conditions, including urbanized areas with significant impervious surfaces."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS lag formula, what is the relationship between the lag and the time of concentration, and what are the recommended conditions for its application?", "answer": "According to the SCS lag formula, the time of concentration equals 1.67 times the lag, where the lag is defined as the time from the center of mass of the excess rainfall to the peak discharge. The SCS recommends this formula for use on homogeneous, nonurban watersheds where overland flow dominates, with a suggested limit of 2000 acres. However, studies have shown that it can provide accurate estimates of the time of concentration for watersheds up to 4000 acres, indicating its potential applicability beyond the initially recommended conditions."}, {"question": "Why are the Kerby-Hathaway and Kirpich equations considered suitable for very small watersheds, and what are the specific conditions under which they were calibrated?", "answer": "The Kerby-Hathaway and Kirpich equations are considered suitable for very small watersheds because they were calibrated using data from such areas. The Kerby-Hathaway equation, for example, was calibrated with watersheds of less than 10 acres, slopes less than 1%, and Manning's n values of 0.8 or less. Kirpich's equations were calibrated for small watersheds in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, with specific ranges of size, slope, and Manning's n values. These equations are tailored to the hydrological characteristics of small watersheds, where surface flow and specific channel conditions dominate."}, {"question": "How does the Van Sickle equation account for both channel and pipe flow in its prediction of the time of concentration?", "answer": "The Van Sickle equation accounts for both channel and pipe flow by incorporating two length variables: the total length of all drainageways and storm sewers greater than 36 inches in diameter (L1) and the total basin length (L2). This approach allows the equation to reflect the combined effects of channel and pipe flow on the time of concentration, making it a \"mixed method\" suitable for watersheds with significant urban drainage infrastructure."}, {"question": "What is the significance of Manning's coefficients in the context of the empirical methods discussed, and how do they influence the estimation of the time of concentration?", "answer": "Manning's coefficients are significant in the context of the empirical methods because they reflect the hydraulic roughness of channels and pipes, influencing the flow velocity and, consequently, the time of concentration. Different values of Manning's n are used in various equations to account for the range of surface conditions, from natural channels to concrete-lined pipes. The variation in Manning's coefficients across different equations and applications highlights the importance of accurately characterizing the hydraulic properties of the watershed in estimating the time of concentration."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.6.6 Summary The input parameters of tc formulas can be separated into four groups: roughness or flow re- sistance, slope, watershed size, and water input. The roughness or flow resistance effect is most often represented by a parameter such as Manning's roughness coefficient (n) or the SCS runoff curve number (CN). The slope of the watershed reflects the momentum of flood runoff. The watershed length is most often used as the watershed size factor, while a rainfall intensity is usually used to represent the water input effect. The importance of each of these inputs varies with the type of analysis being made. For small watershed analyses, the water input is one of the more important inputs. For large watershed analyses and channel reach routing, the water input is much less important, even to the point that methods for estimat- ing time parameters often do not include a variable to reflect the water input. The variation in importance of these inputs reflects the hydrologic factors for which the inputs are used to in- dicate. Since rainfall intensity is an important factor in small watershed design, the rainfall intensity is an important input for time parameters calibrated from small watershed data. The slope and roughness input parameters become more important in the time parameters cali- brated using data from large watersheds; these inputs reflect the storage effects on runoff. Length is more important for channel time parameters because it is a good indicator of the distance a flood wave must travel and the potential for channel storage to attenuate the flood wave. The point here is not to assess the relative importance of each input, but to indicate that time parameters and the input variables that make up these time parameters should be viewed as indicators of the physical processes that are important in runoff estimation. Such Sec. 3.7 Runoff Curve Numbers 155 recognition should lead to proper application and, thus, more accurate assessments of runoff rates. RUNOFF CURVE NUMBERS The SCS runoff cuwe number (CN) was developed as an index that represents the combina- tion of a hydrologic soil group and a land use and treatment class. Empirical analyses sug- gested that the CN was a function of three factors: soil group, the cover complex, and an- tecedent moisture conditions.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of small watershed analyses, why is water input considered one of the more important inputs?", "answer": "Water input is crucial in small watershed analyses because rainfall intensity is a significant factor in small watershed design, directly influencing runoff estimation. This importance is reflected in the calibration of time parameters from small watershed data, where rainfall intensity plays a key role. The emphasis on water input in small watersheds underscores the need to accurately account for rainfall intensity in hydrologic models to predict runoff rates effectively."}, {"question": "How do the importance of input parameters vary with the type of analysis being made in hydrology?", "answer": "The importance of input parameters such as roughness, slope, watershed size, and water input varies significantly with the type of analysis. For small watershed analyses, water input is more critical, whereas for large watershed analyses and channel reach routing, water input becomes less important. This variation reflects the different hydrologic factors that these inputs are used to indicate, such as the momentum of flood runoff and storage effects on runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of large watershed analyses, why do slope and roughness input parameters become more significant?", "answer": "Slope and roughness input parameters become more important in large watershed analyses because they reflect the storage effects on runoff. In larger watersheds, the slope influences the momentum of flood runoff, and roughness affects how water flows over the land surface, impacting runoff rates. These factors are critical in understanding how runoff is generated and routed through the watershed, making slope and roughness key parameters in time parameters calibrated from large watershed data."}, {"question": "What is the role of the SCS runoff curve number (CN) in hydrologic analyses?", "answer": "The SCS runoff curve number (CN) serves as an index that represents the combination of a hydrologic soil group and a land use and treatment class. It is a function of three factors: soil group, the cover complex, and antecedent moisture conditions, providing a simplified way to account for the complex interactions between soil, land use, and moisture in runoff estimation."}, {"question": "How does the length of a watershed impact the estimation of runoff rates?", "answer": "The length of a watershed is an important factor in channel time parameters because it indicates the distance a flood wave must travel and the potential for channel storage to attenuate the flood wave. Longer watersheds may have more opportunities for flood wave attenuation due to channel storage, affecting the timing and magnitude of runoff. This highlights the importance of considering watershed length in hydrologic models to accurately predict runoff rates and flood wave behavior."}, {"question": "In the context of channel reach routing, why is water input often considered less important?", "answer": "Water input is often considered less important in channel reach routing because the methods for estimating time parameters in these contexts frequently do not include a variable to reflect water input. This is due to the diminished role of rainfall intensity in larger watersheds and channel routing, where other factors such as slope, roughness, and channel storage become more dominant in influencing runoff rates and flood wave propagation."}, {"question": "What factors influence the SCS runoff curve number (CN), and how do they relate to runoff estimation?", "answer": "The SCS runoff curve number (CN) is influenced by three primary factors: soil group, the cover complex, and antecedent moisture conditions. These factors collectively impact the runoff potential of a watershed by influencing infiltration rates, surface roughness, and the initial moisture content of the soil. By accounting for these factors, the CN provides a useful index for estimating runoff rates, as it simplifies the complex interactions between soil, land cover, and moisture conditions that affect runoff generation."}, {"question": "How do time parameters and input variables relate to the physical processes important in runoff estimation?", "answer": "Time parameters and the input variables that comprise them should be viewed as indicators of the physical processes that are crucial in runoff estimation. These parameters and variables, such as water input, slope, and roughness, reflect the underlying hydrologic factors that influence runoff, including rainfall intensity, flood momentum, and storage effects. Recognizing this relationship is essential for the proper application of hydrologic models and for achieving more accurate assessments of runoff rates, as it ensures that the models capture the key physical processes governing runoff generation and routing."}, {"question": "In what way does the recognition of input variables as indicators of physical processes lead to more accurate runoff assessments?", "answer": "Recognizing input variables as indicators of physical processes leads to more accurate runoff assessments by ensuring that hydrologic models capture the essential factors influencing runoff. This understanding promotes the proper application of models, as it highlights the need to select and calibrate parameters based on the specific hydrologic characteristics of the watershed being studied. By doing so, models can more effectively simulate the complex interactions between rainfall, soil, land use, and channel characteristics, resulting in more reliable predictions of runoff rates and flood behavior."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.7.1 Soil Group Classification The soil scientists of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) classified more than 4000 soils on the basis of their runoff potential and grouped them into four hydrologic soil groups that are identified by the letters A, B, C, and D. Soil characteristics that are associated with each group are given in Table 3-17. The SCS soil group can be identified at a site using one of three ways: 1. Soil characteristics 2. County soil surveys 3. Minimum infiltration rate The soil characteristics associated with each group are given in Table 3-17 and provide one means of identifying the SCS soil group and are discussed in Section 3.7.4. County soil sur- veys, which are available from Soil Conservation Districts, give detailed descriptions of the soils at locations within a county; these surveys are usually the best means of identifying the soil group and are discussed in Section 3.7.4. As a third method, soil sampling and analysis can also be used to estimate the minimum infiltration rates, which can be used to classify the soil using the following values: Minimum Infiltration Group Rate (in./hr) The published soil survey is the most common method for identifying the soil group.

Soil characteristics, 2. County soil surveys, or 3. Minimum infiltration rate."}, {"question": "In the context of soil group classification, why are county soil surveys considered the best means of identifying the soil group?", "answer": "County soil surveys are considered the best means of identifying the soil group because they provide detailed descriptions of the soils at locations within a county, offering a more precise and localized understanding of soil characteristics. This is crucial for accurate hydrologic soil classification, as it allows for a more nuanced assessment of runoff potential and infiltration rates. Furthermore, these surveys are typically conducted by Soil Conservation Districts, ensuring a level of expertise and reliability in the data provided."}, {"question": "What are the characteristics associated with each hydrologic soil group, and how do they relate to runoff potential?", "answer": "The characteristics associated with each group are given in Table 3-17 and include factors such as soil texture, organic content, and clay composition. These characteristics influence the runoff potential of each group, with Group A having the highest infiltration rates and Group D having the lowest due to its high clay content and tendency to swell when wet."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating minimum infiltration rates, how can soil sampling and analysis be used to classify the soil?", "answer": "Soil sampling and analysis can be used to estimate the minimum infiltration rates, which can then be used to classify the soil into one of the four hydrologic groups based on the following values: Group A, B, C, or D, depending on the infiltration rate. This method provides a direct measurement of the soil's ability to absorb water, allowing for a more quantitative approach to soil classification."}, {"question": "Why do soils in Group D have significantly lower infiltration rates compared to those in Group A?", "answer": "Soils in Group D have significantly lower infiltration rates compared to those in Group A because they are characterized by high clay content and a tendency to swell when wet, which reduces their ability to absorb water. This swelling can lead to a decrease in pore space, further limiting infiltration and resulting in higher runoff potential. In contrast, Group A soils, such as deep sands and aggregated silts, have higher infiltration rates due to their larger pore spaces and lower clay content."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic soil classification, what is the role of organic content in determining the soil group?", "answer": "Organic content plays a role in determining the soil group, as soils low in organic content are typically classified as Group C. Organic content can influence the soil's structure and water-holding capacity, with higher organic content generally associated with higher water retention and lower runoff potential."}, {"question": "How do the characteristics of Group B soils compare to those of Group A soils in terms of runoff potential?", "answer": "Group B soils, characterized by shallow loess and sandy loam, have lower infiltration rates and higher runoff potential compared to Group A soils, which include deep sand and aggregated silts. This difference is due to the shallower depth and finer texture of Group B soils, which reduce their ability to absorb and retain water."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed characteristics, why is understanding hydrologic soil groups important?", "answer": "Understanding hydrologic soil groups is important for watershed characteristics because it allows for the prediction of runoff potential and infiltration rates, which are critical factors in managing water resources and mitigating the effects of flooding and erosion.

However, it implies that these practices have distinct hydrologic characteristics, which is why they are separated in the classification system. Contoured practices may reduce runoff by allowing water to infiltrate the soil, whereas straight row practices may increase runoff due to the lack of obstruction. This difference in hydrologic runoff potential is likely due to the variation in land treatment, which affects the amount of water that infiltrates the soil versus running off the surface."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the level of land management when estimating runoff curve numbers?", "answer": "Considering the level of land management is crucial because it can significantly impact the hydrologic runoff potential of a given land use. Poor land management can lead to increased runoff, while good land management can reduce runoff. By accounting for the level of land management, hydrologists can make more accurate predictions of runoff potential, which is essential for designing effective water management strategies. For instance, in areas with poor land management, additional measures may be necessary to mitigate the increased runoff potential, such as implementing conservation practices or constructing detention ponds."}, {"question": "How does the SCS cover complex classification system account for variations in hydrologic characteristics across different land uses?", "answer": "The SCS cover complex classification system accounts for variations in hydrologic characteristics by separating land uses into distinct categories based on their hydrologic properties. This separation allows hydrologists to estimate runoff curve numbers that reflect the unique hydrologic characteristics of each land use. Additionally, the system considers the level of land management and treatment or practice, which can further impact the hydrologic runoff potential of a given land use.

However, this assumption also places a responsibility on planners and managers to ensure that the vegetation cover is indeed maintained at a high level, potentially requiring ongoing management and conservation efforts to protect the hydrologic condition of these areas."}, {"question": "How does the percentage of ground surface protected by vegetation influence the hydrologic condition of a watershed?", "answer": "The percentage of ground surface protected by vegetation directly influences the hydrologic condition by affecting the infiltration capacity of the soil. Higher percentages of protected ground surface, indicative of better cover quality, lead to increased infiltration and reduced runoff, whereas lower percentages, associated with poorer cover quality, result in decreased infiltration and increased runoff. This relationship underscores the importance of vegetation cover in managing watershed hydrology."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic condition assessment, what are the challenges in maintaining good cover quality, especially in areas prone to certain activities?", "answer": "Maintaining good cover quality can be challenging, especially in areas prone to heavy grazing or regular burning. These activities can significantly degrade the vegetation cover, reducing the percentage of the ground surface protected and thereby decreasing the infiltration capacity of the soil. Addressing these challenges requires proactive and sustainable land management practices that balance human activities with the need to protect and restore vegetation cover, ensuring the long-term health and resilience of the watershed."}]}

For urban land uses with percentages of imperviousness different than those shown in Table 3-18, curve numbers can be computed using a weighted CN approach, with a CN of 98 used for the impervious areas and the CN for open space (good condition) used for the pervious portion of the area.

The following equation can be used to compute a weighted CN (CN,): in which f is the fraction (not percentage) of imperviousness and CN, is the curve number for the pervious portion (39,61,74, or 80). To show the use of Equation 3-58, the CN values for commercial land use with 85% imperviousness are as follows: + A soil: 39(0.15) 98(0.85) = 89 + B soil: 61(0.15) 98(0.85) = 92 + C soil: 74(0.15) 98(0.85) = 94 + D soil: gO(0.15) 98(0.85) = 95 These are the same values shown in Table 3-18. Equation 3-58 can be placed in graphical form (see Figure 3-21a). By entering with the percentage of imperviousness on the vertical axis at the center of the figure and moving horizontally to the pervious area CN, the weighted CN can be read. The examples given for commercial lahd use can be used to illustrate the use of Figure 3-21a for an 85% impervi- ousness. For a commercial land area with 60% imperviousness on a B soil, the composite CN would be The same value can be obtained from Figure 3-21a.

A higher percentage of imperviousness results in a higher composite curve number, indicating a greater proportion of impervious surfaces and a corresponding increase in runoff potential. This relationship is illustrated in the equation CN = (f * 98) + ((1-f) * CNp), where f is the fraction of imperviousness. For example, a commercial land use with 85% imperviousness will have a higher composite curve number than one with 60% imperviousness, due to the increased proportion of impervious surfaces."}, {"question": "What is the implication of using a weighted CN approach for estimating curve numbers in urban areas?", "answer": "The weighted CN approach allows for a more accurate estimation of curve numbers in urban areas, as it takes into account the varying percentages of imperviousness and perviousness. This approach is particularly useful for urban land uses with complex mixtures of impervious and pervious surfaces, as it provides a more nuanced representation of the hydrologic characteristics of the area. However, the accuracy of this approach relies on the accuracy of the input data, including the percentage of imperviousness and the curve numbers for the pervious portion. Additionally, the weighted CN approach may not account for other factors that influence urban hydrology, such as the connectivity of impervious surfaces to the storm drain system."}, {"question": "How does the connectivity of impervious surfaces to the storm drain system affect the composite curve number?", "answer": "The connectivity of impervious surfaces to the storm drain system can significantly impact the composite curve number, as it influences the proportion of impervious surfaces that contribute to runoff. If all impervious surfaces are connected to the storm drain system, the composite curve number will be higher, indicating a greater potential for runoff. In contrast, if less than 30% of the impervious surfaces are not connected, the composite curve number will be lower, indicating a reduced potential for runoff. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 3-21a, which shows the graphical computation of composite curve numbers for different percentages of imperviousness and connectivity to the storm drain system."}, {"question": "In the context of urban land use planning, why is it important to consider the hydrologic implications of imperviousness?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the hydrologic implications of imperviousness in urban land use planning because impervious surfaces can significantly increase the potential for runoff, leading to increased flooding, erosion, and water quality degradation. By understanding the relationship between imperviousness and curve numbers, urban planners can make informed decisions about land use development, taking into account the potential hydrologic impacts of different land use scenarios. This can help to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization on hydrologic systems and promote more sustainable urban development practices."}, {"question": "How do the CN values for different hydrologic soil groups affect the composite curve number?", "answer": "The CN values for different hydrologic soil groups (A, B, C, and D) affect the composite curve number by influencing the curve number for the pervious portion of the urban land use.

{"paragraph": "3.7.8 Effect of Unconnected Impervious Area on Curve Numbers Many local drainage policies are requiring runoff from certain types of impervious land cover (for example, rooftops, driveways, patios) to be directed to pervious surfaces rather than connected to storm drain systems. Such a policy is based on the belief that disconnecting these impervious areas will require smaller and less costly drainage systems and lead both to increased ground water recharge and to improvements in water quality. In the belief that dis- Problems 16 3 connecting some impervious surfaces will reduce both the peak runoff rates and volumes of direct flood runoff, some developers believe that they should be given credit for the reduc- tions in peak rates and volumes in the design of the drainage system. Thus, a need to account for the effect of disconnecting impervious surfaces on runoff rates and volumes exists. Estimating CNs for areas with some unconnected imperviousness requires three impor- tant variables: the pervious area CN, the percentage of impervious area, and the percentage of the imperviousness that is unconnected. The existing figure (Figure 3-21a) for computing composite CN values is based on the pervious area CN and the percentage of impervious- ness. A correction factor to the composite CN is a function of the percentage of unconnected imperviousness. The method of adjustment is given in Figure 3-21b. The correction can only be applied when the percentage of impervious is less than 30%. A correction is not made if the total imperviousness is greater than 30%. The adjusted CN (CN,), Figure 3-21b, can be computed with the following equation: in which If is the fraction of impervious cover, CN, is the pervious area CN, and R is the ratio of the unconnected impervious area to the total impervious area. Example 3-16 To illustrate the use of Figure 3-21, consider the case of a drainage area having 25% impervi- ousness, a pervious area CN of 61, and 50% of the imperviousness unconnected. Enter the right- hand side of Figure 3-21b using 25% imperviousness and move up the graph to the point on the line corresponding to 50% unconnected. Then move from this point horizontally to the left-hand side of the figure until the horizontal line intersects the interpolated line corresponding to the pervious area CN of 61. From this intersection move down to the abscissa and read the value of the composite CN. In this case, the composite CN would be 68. Using Equation 3-59 If credit were not given for unconnected imperviousness, the percent of imperviousness could be entered on Figure 3-21a and the composite CN found using the pervious area CN. For 25% im- perviousness and a pervious area CN of 61 the composite CN would equal 70, which means that disconnecting 50% of the impervious cover allows for the CN to be reduced by 2. This savings can lead to a reduction in peak discharge and runoff volume. PROBLEMS 3-1. A rectangular 3-acre lot is being developed into multifamily housing.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to making technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1. What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rational- ization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved?

An engineer is designing a debris flow protection facility for use at the outlet of a steep canyon. The method that is used to predict the volume of debris (mud flow) that can be expected at the outlet of the canyon requires values of some labor-intensive watershed characteristics (a hypsometric index and the length to the center of area). To keep project costs at a minimum by avoiding the computations for the complex watershed, the engineer uses average values from past projects on which she has worked rather than making the com- putations.

With respect to hydrologic design, only rain and snow are important. This chapter is concerned with rainfall. The problem of snowmelt runoff is addressed in another chapter. Rainfall is the driving force of most hydrologic designs. Design needs arise when and where rainfall occurs at extreme volumes or rates. High rates of rainfall on small urban wa- tersheds often cause flooding of streets and parking lots because drainage facilities are not usually designed to drain all of the water generated by high rainfall intensities. High rainfall rates can also severely damage crops. The absence of rain over long periods of time reduces the rate of flow in streams and rivers, as well as causing lake levels to decline sharply. Low streamflow rates due to the lack of rain can damage stream habitat as well as reduce the ca- pacity of the stream to assimilate wastes discharged into the stream. The decline of lake lev- els can reduce the recreational capacity of a lake, as well as reduce the water available for power generation and inigation. Excessive moisture from low-intensity, long-duration storms can create plant stress, thus limiting the growth of crops. It should be evident that problems can occur from extremes in rainfall, with the extremes in either the rate, the dura- tion, or the time interval between storms. Some hydrologic planning and design problems only require a volume of rainfall. However, for purposes of hydrologic analysis and design, the distribution of rain with re- spect to time is usually required; this time distribution of rainfall is called a hyetograph. A hyetograph is a graph of the rainfall intensity or volume as a function of time. The concept of a hyetograph will be discussed in detail after definitions are provided for precipitation char- acteristics. Storm events can be separated into two groups: actual storms and design storms. Rain- fall analysis is based on actual storms. Either actual or design storms can be used in design. Measurements during an actual storm event are recorded as a series of rainfall depths that oc- Precipitation Chap. 4 Time (hr) FIGURE 4-1 Hourly precipitation at Washington, D.C., on September 13, curred during known time intervals. For example, the precipitation record of the catch at the Washington, D.C., National Airport for September 1983 made at 1-hr intervals is shown in Table 4-1. The storm event of September 13, 1983 starting at 8 a.m. had a total volume of 1.21 in. and a duration of 9 hr. The maximum hourly rate was 0.33 in./hr, which occurred be- tween 10 and 11 a.m. Figure 4-1 shows the hyetograph for this rainfall event. Almost all hydrologic designs are based on what is called the design-storm approach. A design storm is a rainfall hyetograph that has preselected characteristics. A design storm is not an actual measured storm event; in fact, a real storm identical to the design storm has probably never occurred and it is unlikely that it will ever occur. However, most design storms have characteristics that are the average of the characteristics of storms that occurred in the past and, thus, are hypothetical storms that have the average characteristics of storm events that are expected to occur in the future.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why are rain and snow considered important forms of precipitation?", "answer": "Rain and snow are considered important forms of precipitation in hydrologic design because they are the driving forces behind most hydrologic designs, with design needs arising when and where these forms of precipitation occur at extreme volumes or rates."}, {"question": "How do high rates of rainfall impact urban watersheds, and what are the consequences of such events?", "answer": "High rates of rainfall on small urban watersheds often cause flooding of streets and parking lots because drainage facilities are not usually designed to drain all of the water generated by high rainfall intensities.

Furthermore, high rainfall rates can also severely damage crops, highlighting the importance of considering rainfall intensity in hydrologic design and planning."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the time distribution of rainfall in hydrologic analysis and design, and how is it represented?", "answer": "The time distribution of rainfall is crucial in hydrologic analysis and design because it provides a detailed understanding of how rainfall varies over time, which is essential for predicting the impact of rainfall on watersheds and designing appropriate drainage systems. This time distribution is represented by a hyetograph, which is a graph of the rainfall intensity or volume as a function of time."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic planning and design, what are the implications of extremes in rainfall, and how do these extremes impact water resources?", "answer": "Extremes in rainfall, whether in rate, duration, or time interval between storms, can have significant implications for hydrologic planning and design. For instance, excessive moisture from low-intensity, long-duration storms can create plant stress, limiting crop growth, while the absence of rain over long periods can reduce streamflow rates, damage stream habitats, and decrease the capacity of streams to assimilate wastes. These extremes highlight the need for careful consideration of rainfall variability in hydrologic design to mitigate potential negative impacts on water resources and ecosystems."}, {"question": "How do actual storms and design storms differ in the context of hydrologic analysis and design?", "answer": "Actual storms refer to real storm events that have been measured and recorded, whereas design storms are hypothetical storms with preselected characteristics that are used as the basis for hydrologic design. Design storms are not actual measured storm events but rather represent the average characteristics of storms that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of a design storm important in hydrologic design, and what are its underlying assumptions?", "answer": "The concept of a design storm is important in hydrologic design because it provides a standardized and hypothetical scenario against which the performance of drainage systems and water resources infrastructure can be evaluated. The underlying assumption of the design storm approach is that it represents the average characteristics of future storms, allowing designers to plan for and mitigate the potential impacts of extreme rainfall events. This approach is based on the idea that while a real storm identical to the design storm may never occur, the design storm's characteristics are representative of the average conditions that can be expected, thus providing a robust basis for design."}, {"question": "In the context of rainfall analysis, what is the purpose of measuring rainfall depths at known time intervals, and how is this data used?", "answer": "Measuring rainfall depths at known time intervals is crucial for understanding the temporal distribution of rainfall and for constructing hyetographs. This data is used to analyze the characteristics of actual storms, such as total volume, duration, and maximum hourly rate, which are essential for hydrologic design and planning. By analyzing these characteristics, hydrologists can better understand the potential impacts of rainfall on watersheds and design appropriate mitigation strategies."}, {"question": "How does the absence of rain over long periods impact water resources, and what are the potential consequences for ecosystems and human activities?", "answer": "The absence of rain over long periods can significantly impact water resources by reducing the rate of flow in streams and rivers, causing lake levels to decline sharply, and damaging stream habitats. These changes can have cascading effects on ecosystems, reducing the capacity of streams to assimilate wastes and impacting the recreational and economic uses of lakes, such as power generation and irrigation. Furthermore, the decline in water availability can have significant implications for human activities that depend on these water resources, highlighting the need for sustainable water management practices that account for rainfall variability."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between rainfall intensity and crop damage, and how do hydrologists consider this relationship in design and planning?", "answer": "High rainfall rates can severely damage crops, indicating a direct relationship between rainfall intensity and crop damage. Hydrologists consider this relationship in design and planning by analyzing the potential impacts of extreme rainfall events on agricultural areas and designing drainage systems that can mitigate these impacts. This involves understanding the characteristics of rainfall events, including intensity and duration, and how these characteristics affect crop growth and productivity."}]}
{"paragraph": "4.2.1 Volume-Duration-Frequency What are the characteristics that must be identified in either assessing an actual storm or de- veloping a design storm?

THE TIME INDICATED IS THE ENDING TIME OF THE INTERVAL. DATE AND TIME ARE NOT ENTERED FOR TRACE AMOUNTS. 176 Precipitation Chap. 4 Closely related to these definitions is the concept of intensity, which equals the volume di- vided by the duration. For example, a storm having a duration of 2 hr and a volume of 24 acre-in. would have an intensity of 12 acre-in./hour. Volume and depth. The volume of a storm is most often reported as a depth, with units of length such as inches or centimeters; in such cases, the depth is assumed to occur uniformly over the watershed. Thus the volume equals the depth times the watershed area. For example, if the 2-hr storm with a volume of 24 acre-in. occurred on a 6-acre watershed, the depth of rainfall would be 4 in. and the intensity would be 2 in./hr. This interchanging use of units for storm volume often leads to confusion because the terms depth and volume are applied to a quantity having units of length. One might speak of the rainfall volume, but express it in inches. Such statements imply that the depth occurred uniformly over the entire watershed and the units are \"area-inches,\" with the area of the watershed used to compute a volume in acre-inches or some similar set of units. Just as each concept is important by itself, it is also important to recognize the interde- pendence of these terms. A specified depth of rainfall may occur from many different combi- nations of intensities and durations, and these different combinations of intensities and dura- tions will have a significant effect on both runoff volumes and rates, as well as on engineering designs that require rainfall characteristics as input. For example, 3 in. of precip- itation may result from any of the following combinations of intensity and duration: Intensity (in./hr) Duration (hr) Depth (in.) Because the rainfall intensity is an important determinant of the hydrologic response, it is important to specify both the depth and duration (or intensity and duration) and not just the total volume (i.e., depth). Frequency. Just as intensity, duration, and volume are interdependent, the fourth concept, frequency, is also a necessary determinant. Frequency can be discussed in terms of either the exceedence probability or the return period, which are defined as follows: Exceedence probability: the probability that an event having a specified depth and du- ration will be exceeded in one time period, which is most often assumed to be one year. Return period: the average length of time between events having the same depth and duration. The exceedence probability (p) and return period (T) are related by: Sec. 4.2 Rainfall Characteristics The following tabulation gives selected combinations of Equation 4-1 : For example, if a storm of a specified duration and depth has a 1% chance of occurring in any one year, it has an exceedence probability of 0.01 and a return period of 100 years. The argument for not using the term return period to interpret the concept of frequency is that it is sometimes improperly interpreted. Specifically, some individuals believe that if a 100-yr rain (or flood) occurs in any one year, it cannot occur for another 100 years; this belief is false be- cause it implies that storm events occur deterministically rather than randomly. Because storm events occur randomly, there is a finite probability that the 100-yr event could occur in two consecutive years, or not at all in a period of 500 years. Thus the exceedence probability concept is preferred by many. However, engineers commonly use the term return period, and its meaning should be properly understood. VDF interdependence. Events having similar intensities may differ significantly in depth and duration when a difference in frequency occurs. For example, the three storms have similar intensities, but differ significantly in depth, duration, and frequency: Depth Duration Frequency Intensity (in.) (hr) (yr) (in./hr) The table illustrates the need to consider the frequency of the event, as well as the depth, in- tensity, and duration. It is also important to recognize that the relationship between volume, duration, and frequency (VDF) is location dependent; that is, a 3-in. storm for a duration of 3 hr in Miami will occur at a different frequency than the same storm in St. Louis. This implies that, since design storms depend on the VDF characteristics, design storms will vary from one location to another. The following tabulation gives the approximate depth of rainfall for the 2-year, 2-hr storm event: Location P(in.1 Miami Atlanta St. Louis New York Tucson 178 Precipitation Chap. 4 Thus a storm of 3 in. over a period of 2 hr can be expected once every 2 yr in Miami, but a lot less frequently in the other cities, especially Tucson. The values above indicate that the volume of a 2-yr, 2-hr design storm will vary with location. One more tabulation can be used to illustrate further the location dependency of the VDF relationship; the following return periods are for a 4-in. storm event with a duration of 24 hr: Location T(Y~) Miami Atlanta St. Louis New York Tucson In Miami, such a storm occurs more often than once every 2 yr, but in Tucson, the same rain- fall would occur less frequently than once every 100 yr. Relationships between rainfall depth, duration, and frequency can be displayed graphi- cally. The relationship is shown with the depth as the ordinate and the duration on the ab- scissa, with separate curves given for selected exceedence frequencies. Frequencies of 0.5, 0.2,O. 1,0.04,0.02, and 0.01, which correspond to return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25,50, and 100 years, respectively, are the ones most commonly used. VDF curves are developed using a statistical method called frequency analysis, which is the subject of another chapter.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic analysis and design, what are the three key characteristics that must be identified in assessing an actual storm or developing a design storm?", "answer": "The three key characteristics are duration, volume, and frequency, which are crucial in understanding the behavior and impact of precipitation events."}, {"question": "How do the concepts of intensity, volume, and depth relate to each other in the context of storm events, and why is it important to understand these relationships?", "answer": "Intensity equals the volume divided by the duration, and volume can be expressed as a depth over a watershed area. Understanding these relationships is important because a specified depth of rainfall may occur from many different combinations of intensities and durations, significantly affecting runoff volumes, rates, and engineering designs. For instance, the same depth of rainfall can result from various combinations of intensity and duration, leading to different hydrologic responses and design implications."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of frequency, in terms of exceedence probability or return period, necessary for understanding storm events, and how does it relate to the other characteristics?", "answer": "Frequency is necessary because it determines the likelihood of an event occurring, which is crucial for design and planning purposes. The exceedence probability and return period are related, with the return period being the average time between events of the same depth and duration. This concept is important because it helps in understanding that storm events occur randomly, and there is a finite probability that a significant event could occur in consecutive years or not at all in a long period, which has implications for design storms and flood protection."}, {"question": "In the context of storm events, how does the location dependency of the volume-duration-frequency (VDF) relationship affect design storms, and what implications does this have for hydrologic design?", "answer": "The VDF relationship is location-dependent, meaning that a storm of the same depth and duration will occur at different frequencies in different locations. This affects design storms because the volume of a design storm will vary with location. For example, a 3-inch storm over 2 hours can be expected once every 2 years in Miami but less frequently in other cities like Tucson. This location dependency implies that design storms must be tailored to the specific hydrologic characteristics of each location, which can be challenging due to the variability in rainfall patterns and the need for accurate frequency analysis."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of frequency analysis in the context of hydrology, and how is it used to develop volume-duration-frequency (VDF) curves?", "answer": "Frequency analysis is a statistical method used to develop VDF curves, which display the relationship between rainfall depth, duration, and frequency. The purpose of frequency analysis is to quantify the probability of storm events of different magnitudes and durations, allowing for the creation of VDF curves that are essential for hydrologic design and planning. These curves are developed by analyzing the statistical distribution of rainfall events and are critical for understanding the likelihood and potential impact of future storm events."}, {"question": "Why is it important to recognize the interdependence of the terms volume, duration, and frequency in hydrologic analysis, and what are the implications of this interdependence?", "answer": "Recognizing the interdependence of volume, duration, and frequency is important because it affects the hydrologic response and design implications. Different combinations of these characteristics can lead to significantly different outcomes in terms of runoff volumes and rates. The interdependence implies that design storms should consider all these factors to accurately predict and prepare for potential flood events and other hydrologic challenges. This understanding is crucial for developing effective hydrologic designs that can mitigate the impacts of storm events."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, how does the use of the term \"return period\" relate to the concept of frequency, and why is there an argument against using this term to interpret frequency?", "answer": "The return period is related to the concept of frequency as it represents the average length of time between events of the same depth and duration. However, there is an argument against using the term \"return period\" because it can be misinterpreted to imply that storm events occur deterministically rather than randomly. This misconception can lead to incorrect assumptions about the likelihood of future events, highlighting the importance of understanding the probabilistic nature of storm occurrences."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the location dependency of the VDF relationship for hydrologic design and planning, especially in terms of designing for extreme events?", "answer": "The location dependency of the VDF relationship implies that hydrologic designs must be tailored to the specific location, considering the local rainfall patterns and frequencies. This is particularly important for designing for extreme events, as the same event could have vastly different return periods in different locations. For example, a storm that is considered rare in one location might be more common in another, necessitating different design approaches to ensure safety and resilience. This highlights the need for detailed, location-specific hydrologic analyses to inform design decisions."}]}

This is crucial for accurate design and planning, as national maps might not capture the specific rainfall characteristics of a particular region.

{"paragraph": "4.2.3 Intensity-Duration-Frequency In addition to volume-duration-frequency curves, intensity-duration-frequency curves are readily available because a rainfall intensity is used as input to many hydrologic design methods. Because of the importance of the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship in hydrologic analyses, IDF curves have been compiled for most localities; the IDF curve for Baltimore, Maryland, is shown in Figure 4-4. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve is most often used by entering with the duration and frequency to find the intensity. For example, the 10-yr, 2-hr rainfall intensity for Baltimore is found from Figure 4-4 by entering with a duration of 2 hr, moving vertically to the 10-yr frequency curve, and then moving horizontally to the intensity ordinate, whch yields i = 1.3 in./hour. This corresponds to a storm depth of 2.6 in. The IDF curve could also be used to find the frequency for a measured storm event. The predicted frequency is determined by finding the intersection of the lines defined by the measured intensity and the storm duration. If the volume rather than the intensity is mea- Sec. 4.2 Rainfall Characteristics FIGURE 4-2 Twenty-four-hour rainfall, in inches, to be expected once in 100 years.

Using this intensity and duration, the curve can be consulted to find the corresponding frequency or return period, which indicates how often such a storm can be expected to occur."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between storm volume, intensity, and duration, and how is it used in hydrologic analyses?", "answer": "The relationship between storm volume, intensity, and duration is fundamental in hydrologic analyses. The intensity of a storm is determined by dividing the volume by the duration. Knowing any two of these variables allows the third to be calculated. For example, if the volume and duration of a storm are known, the intensity can be calculated, and then the intensity-duration-frequency curve can be used to find the frequency or return period of the storm. This relationship is crucial for understanding and predicting storm events and their impacts on hydrologic systems."}, {"question": "Why is it important to determine the intensity of a storm before finding its frequency if only the volume is measured?", "answer": "Determining the intensity of a storm is necessary before finding its frequency because the intensity-duration-frequency curve is based on intensity and duration, not volume. If only the volume is measured, calculating the intensity first allows hydrologists to use the IDF curve correctly. This step is essential because the frequency or return period of a storm, which is critical for hydrologic design and planning, cannot be directly determined from the volume alone without first converting it into an intensity value."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what implications does the intensity-duration-frequency relationship have for planning and management?", "answer": "The intensity-duration-frequency relationship has significant implications for hydrologic design, planning, and management. Understanding this relationship allows hydrologists to predict the likelihood and characteristics of future storm events, which is crucial for designing infrastructure such as drainage systems, dams, and flood protection measures. By knowing the expected intensity and frequency of storms, planners can design systems that are resilient to extreme events, thereby reducing the risk of flooding and ensuring the safety and efficiency of water resources management systems."}, {"question": "How does the intensity-duration-frequency curve facilitate the comparison of storm events across different locations?", "answer": "The intensity-duration-frequency curve facilitates the comparison of storm events across different locations by providing a standardized framework for analyzing rainfall intensity, duration, and frequency. Although the specific curves may vary by location due to differences in climate and rainfall patterns, the concept and application of IDF curves remain consistent. This consistency enables hydrologists to compare the characteristics of storm events in different areas, which is valuable for regional planning, water resources management, and understanding the variability of hydrologic conditions across different geographical locations."}, {"question": "In the context of water resources management, why is understanding the return period of storm events important?", "answer": "Understanding the return period of storm events is important in water resources management because it helps in assessing the risk and likelihood of extreme hydrologic events. The return period, which is the reciprocal of the exceedance probability, indicates how often a storm of a certain intensity and duration can be expected to occur. This information is critical for designing and operating water infrastructure, managing flood risk, and making informed decisions about water allocation and conservation. By knowing the return period of significant storm events, managers can better prepare for and respond to these events, reducing the potential for damage and ensuring the sustainable use of water resources."}]}
{"paragraph": "4.2.4 Mathematical Representation of lDF Curves Given the interest in computerizing the elements of hydrologic design, it is worthwhile to present mathematical forms to represent the IDF curve. The following equations can provide a reasonably accurate representation of an IDF curve: a / m i = for D a 2 hr in which i is the rainfall intensity (in./hr); D is the duration (hr); and a, b, c, and d are fitting coefficients that vary with the frequency. Values for the coefficients are easily obtained by transforming Equation 4-2 to linear forms and evaluating the coefficients using any two points of the IDF curve by solving two simultaneous equations. Equation 4-2a is trans- formed to linear form as follows: Sec. 4.2 Rainfall Characteristics Baltimore, Maryland 1903-1951 ' 20.0 15.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 2 - 1.0 . .c- > 0.8 .4-- In 0.6 -4c- -- 0.4 r.C- 2 0.2 0.1 0.08 0.06 - 0.04 0.02 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 2 3 4 5 6 8 1012 18 24 Minutes DURATION Hours FIGURE 4-4 Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency. (National Weather Service, 1961.) in which y = lli,f = bla, and g = lla. Equation 4-2b is transformed to linear form by making a logarithmic transform: i = C D ~ (4-44 + logi = logc dlog D (4-4b) y = h + d x (4-4~) in which y = log i, h = log c, and x = log D. Either natural or base-10 logarithms can be used. Equations 4-3c and 4-4c are linear and can be solved as two simultaneous equations using 182 Precipitation Chap. 4 any two points from an IDF curve. The accuracy depends on the reading accuracy of the two points selected and on the ability of Equation 4-2a to represent the shape of the IDF curve. Greater accuracy can be achieved by using numerous points from the IDF curve and fitting the coefficients of Equations 4-3c and 4-4c using least squares (see Chapter 2). Be- cause the ordinate and abscissa of Figure 4 4 a re both logarithmic, it is not always possible to accurately interpolate the values from the curve. The use of many points will minimize the effect of interpolation error; however, greater computational effort is obviously required when the least squares approach is used. Example 4-1 To illustrate the calculation of the coefficients of Equation 4-2a, the following two points from Figure 44 for a 2-yr frequency will be used with Equation 4-3c: (i = 4.1 in./hr, D = 116 hr) and (i = 0.81, D = 2). Making the necessary transformations yields Solving Equations 4-5 for f and g yields f = 0.1538 and g = 0.5404. Solving for a and b yields the following: 1.8505 1 = -- for D s 2 hr + 0.2847 D Equation 4-6 should provide intensities that are within 0.01 of values obtained from Figure 4-2. For durations greater than 2 hr, the following two points can be used to estimate c and d for Equation 4-2b: (i = 0.5, D = 4) and (i = 0.3, D = 8). Making natural-logarithm transforma- tions yields d = -0.7370 and h = 0.3286. Thus Equation 4-2b is Using two points to define the function can lead to a discontinuity at the 2-hr point of separation. For a D of 2 hr, Equation 4-6b yields a computed intensity of 0.833 in./hr, which is greater than the value predicted by Equation 4-6a. It is also higher than the value taken from Figure 4 4 fo r a duration of 2 hr. This problem can be solved either by using a more complex fitting method, such as numerical least squares with a constraint that the lines match at D = 2 hrs, or by includ- ing a greater number of sample points from the curve near the 2-hr duration. Equations 4-6 can be used to represent the IDF curve for the 2-yr event in Baltimore. Similar equations can be de- veloped for the other return periods. Example 4-2 A set of points, given in Table 4-2, were taken for both segments of the 2-yr IDF curve of Fig- ure 4-4. The following equations were fit using least squares: 1.804 i = for D < 2 hr + D 0.284 i = 1.37 D - ~ .fo~r D~ 2 2 hr (4-7b) The curves agree closely with the measured points except for durations less than 10 min. The two computed curves also show a discontinuity at the point of intersection (i.e., 2 hr).

This variation is crucial in hydrologic design, as it enables engineers to account for the changing rainfall intensity and duration characteristics associated with different frequencies. The ability to accurately model these changes is essential for designing infrastructure that can withstand various rainfall events."}, {"question": "In the context of calculating the coefficients of the IDF curve equations, why is it necessary to transform the equations to linear forms?", "answer": "Transforming the equations to linear forms is necessary to facilitate the calculation of the coefficients using any two points of the IDF curve by solving two simultaneous equations. This transformation enables the use of linear regression techniques, such as least squares, to determine the coefficients, which is a more straightforward and efficient process than working with non-linear equations."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using only two points to define the IDF curve function, and how can this issue be addressed?", "answer": "Using only two points to define the IDF curve function can lead to a discontinuity at the point of separation, resulting in inaccurate predictions. This issue can be addressed by using a more complex fitting method, such as numerical least squares with a constraint that the lines match at the point of separation, or by including a greater number of sample points from the curve near the point of separation. This approach can help to minimize the effect of interpolation error and provide a more accurate representation of the IDF curve."}, {"question": "How do the equations for the IDF curve change for durations greater than 2 hours, and what are the implications of this change?", "answer": "For durations greater than 2 hours, the equation for the IDF curve changes to i = cD^d, where c and d are new coefficients that need to be estimated. This change implies that the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration is different for longer durations, and that a separate set of coefficients is required to accurately model this relationship. This change can have significant implications for hydrologic design, as it may require the use of different design criteria for longer-duration events."}, {"question": "In the context of fitting the IDF curve using least squares, what are the benefits and challenges of using this approach?", "answer": "The benefits of using least squares to fit the IDF curve include the ability to minimize the effect of interpolation error and provide a more accurate representation of the curve. However, the challenges of this approach include the need for a large number of sample points from the curve, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. Additionally, the use of least squares requires a good understanding of statistical analysis and regression techniques, which can be a barrier for some users."}, {"question": "Why is it important to use a sufficient number of sample points from the IDF curve when fitting the equations using least squares?", "answer": "Using a sufficient number of sample points from the IDF curve is important because it helps to minimize the effect of interpolation error and provides a more accurate representation of the curve. With a large number of sample points, the least squares method can better capture the underlying relationship between rainfall intensity and duration, resulting in more accurate predictions and a more reliable design. This is particularly important in hydrologic design, where small errors can have significant consequences."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what are the implications of accurately representing the IDF curve, and why is this important?", "answer": "Accurately representing the IDF curve is important in hydrologic design because it enables engineers to design infrastructure that can withstand various rainfall events. The IDF curve provides critical information about the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration, which is essential for designing stormwater management systems, flood control structures, and other hydrologic infrastructure. Inaccurate representations of the IDF curve can lead to inadequate design, which can result in flooding, erosion, and other negative consequences."}, {"question": "How do the coefficients of the IDF curve equations relate to the frequency of rainfall events, and what are the implications of this relationship?", "answer": "The coefficients of the IDF curve equations vary with the frequency of rainfall events, which means that different coefficients are required to accurately model the IDF curve for different return periods. This relationship implies that the characteristics of rainfall events change with frequency, and that these changes need to be accounted for in hydrologic design. The use of frequency-dependent coefficients enables engineers to design"}]}
{"paragraph": "4.2.5 Depth-Area Adjustments The rainfall depths for IDF curves, such as those of Figure 4-4, represent estimates for small areas. For designs on areas larger than a few square miles, the point rainfall estimates ob- tained from IDF curves must be adjusted. The point estimates represent extreme values. As the spatial extent of a storm increases, the average depth of rainfall over the watershed de- creases; actual storms have a spatial pattern as well as time variation. Figure 4-5 shows the storm pattern for the total storm rainfall (inches) for the August 1, 1985, event in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Figure 4-6 shows a design storm rainfall pattern that is used in estimating proba- ble maximum floods. Both of these figures show that the rainfall depth decreases from the center of the storm as the size of the storm cell increases. When selecting a point rainfall to apply uniformly over a watershed, the point value from an IDF curve needs to be reduced to account for the areal extent of the storm. The reduction is made using a depth-area adjust- ment factor. The factor is a function of the drainage area (square miles) and the rainfall dura- tion. Figure 4-7 shows depth-area adjustment factors based on Weather Bureau Technical Paper No. 40. Tlxs set of curves can be used unless specific curves derived from regional analyses are available. Figure 4-7 shows that the adjustment factor decreases from 100% as the watershed area increases and as the storm duration decreases. Beyond a drainage area of 300 mi2 the adjustment factor shows little change with increasing area. Example 4-3 To illustrate the use of Figures 4 4 a nd 4-7, consider the case of a 200-mi' watershed near Bal- timore, Maryland, where the design standard requires the use of a 24-hr storm duration and a Sec. 4.2 Rainfall Characteristics Isohyet Areas Isohyet Areas A- 10mi2 Not Shown B- 25 0- 10000mi2 C- 50 P-15000 0- 100 Q-25000 E- 175 R-40000 0 10 20 30 40 50 F- 300 S-60000 I l l I G- 450 Miles H- 700 I- loo0 J- 1500 K- 2 150 L- 3000 M- 4500 N- 6500 FIGURE 4-6 Standard isohyetal pattern. 100-yr return period. The point rainfall from Figure 4-4 is 0.3 in./h.r or a depth of 7.2 in. The depth-area curve of Figure 4-7 indicates an adjustment factor of 91% or 0.91. Therefore, the rainfall depth, which will be assumed constant over the 200-mi2 watershed, is 6.55 in. The re- duction of 0.65 in. from the point rainfall of 7.2 in. accounts for the reduction in rainfall volume due to the variability of rainfall depth over the watershed, as illustrated by the actual and hypo- thetical rainfall patterns of Figures 4-5 and 4-6, respectively.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of rainfall depth estimation for large areas, why is it necessary to adjust point rainfall estimates obtained from IDF curves?", "answer": "It is necessary to adjust point rainfall estimates because as the spatial extent of a storm increases, the average depth of rainfall over the watershed decreases, and actual storms have both spatial patterns and time variations. This adjustment accounts for the reduction in rainfall volume due to the variability of rainfall depth over the watershed. The adjustment is crucial for accurate design and planning, especially for areas larger than a few square miles."}, {"question": "How do depth-area adjustment factors change with increasing watershed area and storm duration, according to the provided information?", "answer": "Depth-area adjustment factors decrease as the watershed area increases and as the storm duration decreases. However, beyond a drainage area of 300 mi^2, the adjustment factor shows little change with increasing area. This indicates that for very large watersheds, the adjustment factor becomes less sensitive to the size of the watershed but remains influenced by storm duration."}, {"question": "In the context of designing for probable maximum floods, what is the significance of understanding the spatial pattern of storm rainfall?", "answer": "Understanding the spatial pattern of storm rainfall is significant because it allows for the estimation of probable maximum floods by considering how rainfall depth decreases from the center of the storm as the size of the storm cell increases. This spatial variability affects the total rainfall volume over a watershed, impacting flood predictions and design standards."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the areal extent of a storm when selecting a point rainfall to apply uniformly over a watershed?", "answer": "Considering the areal extent of a storm is important because point rainfall values from IDF curves represent extreme values for small areas. Applying these values uniformly over larger areas without adjustment would overestimate rainfall depths, leading to inaccurate designs and potentially unsafe structures. The adjustment for areal extent helps in achieving a more realistic and safe design."}, {"question": "How does the depth-area adjustment factor account for the variability of rainfall depth over a watershed?", "answer": "The depth-area adjustment factor accounts for the variability of rainfall depth by reducing the point rainfall estimate to reflect the average depth of rainfall over the larger area. This reduction acknowledges that rainfall is not uniform over the watershed and that the point value from an IDF curve needs to be adjusted to accurately represent the rainfall volume for design purposes."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological design, what implications does the spatial pattern of rainfall have on flood prediction and watershed management?", "answer": "The spatial pattern of rainfall has significant implications for flood prediction and watershed management. It affects the distribution and volume of rainfall over a watershed, influencing runoff, flood peaks, and the overall hydrological response of the watershed. Understanding and accurately modeling this spatial variability are crucial for effective flood prediction, design of hydraulic structures, and watershed management strategies."}, {"question": "Why do depth-area adjustment factors decrease with increasing storm duration, according to the principles outlined?", "answer": "The decrease in depth-area adjustment factors with increasing storm duration is not explicitly stated as a principle in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that longer storm durations might lead to more uniform rainfall distribution over larger areas, potentially reducing the need for significant adjustments. This inference requires further hydrological principles not directly mentioned in the paragraph."}, {"question": "How does the example provided illustrate the application of depth-area adjustment factors in hydrological design?", "answer": "The example illustrates the application of depth-area adjustment factors by considering a 200-mi^2 watershed near Baltimore, Maryland, with a design standard requiring a 24-hr storm duration and a 100-yr return period. The point rainfall from the IDF curve is adjusted using a depth-area curve, resulting in a reduced rainfall depth that accounts for the areal extent of the storm. This adjusted depth is then used for design purposes, demonstrating how depth-area adjustment factors are applied in practice to ensure more accurate and safe designs."}, {"question": "In the context of rainfall depth estimation, what is the role of isohyetal patterns in understanding storm rainfall variability?", "answer": "Isohyetal patterns, as shown in figures like Figure 4-6, play a crucial role in understanding storm rainfall variability by illustrating how rainfall depth decreases from the center of the storm as the size of the storm cell increases. These patterns help in visualizing and quantifying the spatial distribution of rainfall, which is essential for accurate depth-area adjustments and hydrological design."}, {"question": "Why is it recommended to use specific curves derived from regional analyses if available, instead of the general depth-area adjustment factors provided?", "answer": "Using specific curves derived from regional analyses is recommended because they can provide more accurate and location-specific adjustments. General depth-area adjustment factors, like those shown in Figure 4-7, are based on broader data and may not capture the unique hydrological characteristics of a specific region. Regional analyses can offer more tailored adjustments, leading to more precise hydrological designs and better management of water resources."}]}

Some designs are based on average expected rainfall depths, while high-hazard projects are often based on extreme amounts. Therefore, it is necessary to have some idea of both the typ- ical and the not-so-typical amounts. Table 4-3 provides the recorded maximum point rain- falls at different locations.

This understanding is essential for designing projects that can withstand various precipitation scenarios, from average to extreme events. By acknowledging the variability in rainfall, engineers can develop more resilient and reliable designs."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to accurately estimate the return frequency of maximum recorded precipitation values?", "answer": "It is challenging to accurately estimate the return frequency of maximum recorded precipitation values because these values represent the extremes, and there may not be sufficient historical data to establish a reliable frequency analysis. The rarity of such extreme events means that the dataset for analysis is limited, making it difficult to predict with certainty how often these events might recur."}, {"question": "How do the comparisons between recorded maximum point rainfalls and expected values for return periods illustrate the variability of rainfall?", "answer": "The comparisons between recorded maximum point rainfalls (like the 24-hr maximum of about 46 in. in the Philippines) and expected values for return periods (such as the 100-yr event in New York) vividly illustrate the variability of rainfall. These comparisons show that rainfall depths can vary significantly with duration, frequency, and location, emphasizing the need for location-specific and duration-specific data in hydrologic design. For example, the 24-hr recorded maximum in the Philippines is almost seven times larger than the expected 24-hr event in New York, highlighting the considerable geographic variation in extreme rainfall events."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation extremes, how does the location influence the expected rainfall depths for given return periods?", "answer": "Location significantly influences the expected rainfall depths for given return periods, as evidenced by the differences in expected rainfall depths for cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Phoenix (as shown in Table 4-4). For instance, the expected rainfall depth for a 100-yr, 24-hr event varies substantially among these locations, ranging from 5.0 in. in Phoenix to 9.0 in. in Los Angeles. This variation underscores the importance of using location-specific data in hydrologic design to accurately assess precipitation-related risks."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the significant variation in rainfall depths with duration, frequency, and location for hydrologic design?", "answer": "The significant variation in rainfall depths with duration, frequency, and location has a critical implication for hydrologic design: it necessitates the use of detailed, location-specific, and duration-specific precipitation data. This requirement ensures that designs can accommodate the range of potential precipitation scenarios, from typical to extreme events, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of hydrologic projects. The failure to account for this variability could lead to underestimation or overestimation of precipitation risks, potentially resulting in design failures or unnecessary costs."}, {"question": "How do the recorded maximum point rainfalls, such as those in Table 4-3, contribute to the understanding of extreme precipitation events?", "answer": "The recorded maximum point rainfalls in Table 4-3 contribute to the understanding of extreme precipitation events by providing actual measurements of the most intense rainfall events recorded at various locations. These measurements serve as a reference for the upper limits of precipitation that can occur, helping engineers and hydrologists to better understand the potential extremes in rainfall.

{"paragraph": "4.3 ESTIMATING MISSING RAINFALL DATA Measured precipitation data are important to many problems in hydrologic analysis and de- sign. Because of the cost associated with data collection, it is very important to have com- plete records at every station. Obviously, conditions sometimes prevent this. For gages that require periodic observation, the failure of the observer to make the necessary visit to the gage may result in missing data. Vandalism of recording gages is another problem that re- sults in incomplete data records, and instrument failure because of mechanical or electrical malfunctioning can result in missing data. Any such causes of instrument failure reduce the length and information content of the precipitation record. Certainly, rainfall records are important. Rainfall data are an important input to hydro- logic designs, whether measured storm event data or synthetic data based on characteristics of measured data. A number of federal and state agencies, most notably the National 188 Precipitation Chap. 4 Weather Service, have extensive data collection networks. They collect and analyze data to provide those who need such information with reasonably complete data records and accu- rate data summaries, such as IDF curves. Those involved in legal cases, such as for flooding that may be the result of human-made watershed modifications, also require accurate and complete rainfall records. Those involved in hydrologic research also require precipitation records to test models and evaluate hydrologic effects. Where parts of records are missing, it may be desirable, even necessary, to estimate the missing part of the record. A number of methods have been proposed for estimating missing rainfall data. The station-average method is the simplest method. The normal-ratio and quadrant methods pro- vide a weighted mean, with the former basing the weights on the mean annual rainfall at each gage and the latter having weights that depend on the distance between the gages where recorded data are available and the point where a value is required.

This ensures that the estimation is based on similar hydrological conditions, thereby increasing the reliability of the estimated missing data. Furthermore, understanding the average annual catch provides a basis for evaluating the representativeness of the regional gages for the point of interest, which is crucial for making informed decisions in hydrological studies and applications."}, {"question": "How does the station-average method conceptually simplify the estimation of missing rainfall data?", "answer": "The station-average method conceptually simplifies the estimation by using a straightforward averaging approach, where the missing point rainfall is estimated as the average of the catches at the regional gages. This simplicity makes the method easy to apply, provided the conditions for its use are met. However, this simplicity also means that the method may not capture complex spatial variations in rainfall patterns, which could be a limitation in certain hydrological contexts. The method's conceptual simplicity is based on the assumption of uniformity in the catch values among the regional gages, which, if violated, could lead to inaccuracies in the estimated missing data."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the station-average method when the annual catches at the regional gages differ significantly from the point of interest?", "answer": "Using the station-average method under such conditions could lead to inaccurate estimates of the missing rainfall data. This inaccuracy arises because the method assumes a level of homogeneity in the hydrological characteristics of the regional gages and the point of interest, which may not be valid if the annual catches differ significantly. As a result, the estimated missing data may not accurately represent the actual hydrological conditions at the point of interest, potentially leading to misinformed decisions in water resource management and planning. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the applicability of the station-average method based on the similarity of hydrological conditions before proceeding with its application."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating missing rainfall data, why is it necessary to evaluate the difference in annual catches between the regional gages and the point of interest?", "answer": "Evaluating this difference is necessary to determine the applicability of the station-average method. A significant difference (more than 10%) may indicate that the hydrological conditions at the regional gages are not representative of the point of interest, thereby suggesting that the station-average method may not provide accurate estimates. This evaluation step is critical for ensuring that the chosen estimation method is appropriate for the specific hydrological context, which in turn affects the reliability and usefulness of the estimated missing data for further analysis and decision-making."}]}
{"paragraph": "4.3.2 Normal-Ratio Method The normal-ratio method is conceptually simple, but it differs from the station-average method of Equation 4-8 in that the average annual catch is used to derive weights for the P: rainfall depths at the individual stations. The general formula for computing is in which wiis the weight for the rainfall depth Pi at gage i. The weight for station i is com- puted by in which Ai is the average annual catch at gage i, A, is the average annual catch at station X, and n is the number of stations. The weights will not sum to 1 unless the mean of the average annual catches for the n stations equals the average annual catch at gage X. The sum of the weights will equal the ratio of the average annual catch at gage X to the mean of the average annual catches for the n gages. This is rational because, if gage X has a lower average annual catch, we would then expect the catch for an individual storm to be less than the mean of the storm event catches for the gages. When the average annual catches for all of the gages are equal, the station-average and normal-ratio methods yield the same estimate. When the vari- ation in the average annual catches is small (less than lo%), the two methods provide esti- mates that are nearly similar, and the difference in the estimates does not warrant use of the additional information in the form of the average annual catches. When the average annual catches differ by more than lo%, the normal-ratio method is preferable; such differences might occur in regions where there are large differences in elevation (for example, regions where orographic effects are present) or where average annual rainfall is low but has high annual variability. The conceptual basis of the normal-ratio method may be more apparent if Equations 4-10 and 4-1 1 are rewritten as The ratio Pi/Aii s the proportion for gage i of the mean annual catch that occurs in the specific storm; thus the right-hand side of Equation 4-12 is the average proportion. This average pro- portion is then used as the proportion at gage X where amount P, was not recorded, and the estimate of P, is found by multiplying the average proportion, j, by the average annual catch p at gage X, A,. The value of is considered to be the best estimate of the true proportion p of the catch during the storm for which the recorded value is missing. 190 Precipitation Chap. 4 Example r15 To illustrate the normal-ratio method, consider the following data: Average Annual Total Storm Gage Rainfall (in.) Rainfall (in.) The storm-event catch for gage Xis missing and can be estimated using the data from the table. The average annual rainfall at the four gages is 41 in. Ten percent of this is 4.1 in. Since the an- nual rainfall at gage C is more than 4.1 in. from the mean of 40 in., the normal-ratio method should be used. The estimate from the normal-ratio method is + + = 0.325(2.4) 0.360(2.3) 0.290(3.1) = 2.51 in. Whereas the station-average method would yield an estimate of 2.60 in., Equation 4-13a indi- cates a value of 2.5 1 in. with the normal-ratio method. The latter value is less than the average of the other stations because the mean annual catch at gage X is less than the mean of the average annual catches at gages A, B, and C (i.e., 40 in. versus 41.33 in.). For the data used with Equation 4-13 the storm rainfall estimated with the normal-ratio method expressed in the form of Equation 4-10 is = 40(0.06270) = 2.51 in. Thus the proportion at the gages with a known storm catch ranged from 0.059 to 0.067, with a mean proportion of 0.0627; this mean proportion is used as the best estimate of the proportion for the gage with the missing storm event rainfall. The estimate equals the estimate obtained from Equations 4-10 and 4-1 1. 4.3.3 lsohyetal Method The isohyetal method is another alternative for estimating missing rainfall data. The proce- dure is essentially the same as that used for the isohyetal method when it is applied to the problem of estimating mean areal rainfall (see Section 4.5.3). The location and catch for each Sec. 4.3 Estimating Missing Rainfall Data 191 gage are located on a map and used to draw lines of equal catch (that is, isohyets) for the storm duration of interest. The location of the gage for which data are missing is then plotted on the map and the catch estimated by interpolation within the isohyets. Of course, the accu- racy of the estimate will depend on the number of gages used to draw the isohyets, the homo- geneity of the meteorological conditions that generated the storm, and, if they exist, oro- graphic effects. Example 4-6 The isohyetal pattern shown in Figure 4-5 can be used to illustrate the isohyetal method. If a rain gage were located at the confluence of Diamond and Crow Creeks and the data for the August 1, 1985, storm event were missing, the isohyets would suggest a total storm depth of 3.5 in. In some parts of the isohyetal map, interpolation is not wholly objective; for example, in the area about the point defined by a latitude and longitude of 41°10'N and 104\"45'W, the isohyet for 2 in. deviates considerably from the isohyet for 3 in. and there is no isohyet shown for 1 in.

Specifically, the weight for station i is calculated as the ratio of the average annual catch at gage i to the average annual catch at station X, multiplied by the inverse of the number of stations. This approach allows for the incorporation of the average annual catch data into the weight calculation, providing a more nuanced estimate of rainfall depths."}, {"question": "Why does the normal-ratio method yield the same estimate as the station-average method when the average annual catches for all gages are equal?", "answer": "The normal-ratio method yields the same estimate as the station-average method when the average annual catches for all gages are equal because, in such cases, the weights computed for each station are essentially the same. This occurs because the ratio of the average annual catch at each gage to the mean of the average annual catches for all gages is constant, resulting in equal weights for all stations. Consequently, the weighted average of the rainfall depths is equivalent to the simple average of the rainfall depths, making the two methods equivalent."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating missing rainfall data, how does the isohyetal method differ from the normal-ratio method?", "answer": "The isohyetal method differs from the normal-ratio method in that it involves drawing lines of equal catch (isohyets) on a map to estimate missing rainfall data. This approach relies on the spatial distribution of rainfall data from surrounding gages, whereas the normal-ratio method uses the average annual catch data from individual gages to compute weights for estimating missing rainfall depths. The isohyetal method can provide a more detailed, spatially explicit estimate of rainfall patterns, but its accuracy depends on the density of gage locations and the homogeneity of meteorological conditions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the normal-ratio method when the variation in average annual catches is small (less than 10%)?", "answer": "When the variation in average annual catches is small (less than 10%), the normal-ratio method provides estimates that are nearly similar to those obtained using the station-average method. In such cases, the additional information provided by the average annual catch data does not significantly improve the estimate, and the use of the normal-ratio method may not be warranted. However, when the variation in average annual catches is larger, the normal-ratio method can provide a more accurate estimate by accounting for the differences in average annual catch between gages."}, {"question": "Why is the normal-ratio method preferable when the average annual catches differ by more than 10%?", "answer": "The normal-ratio method is preferable when the average annual catches differ by more than 10% because it takes into account the variation in average annual catch between gages. This is particularly important in regions with large differences in elevation or where average annual rainfall is low but has high annual variability. By incorporating the average annual catch data into the weight calculation, the normal-ratio method can provide a more accurate estimate of missing rainfall depths, especially in areas with significant spatial variability in rainfall patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of the isohyetal method, what factors can affect the accuracy of the estimated missing rainfall data?", "answer": "The accuracy of the estimated missing rainfall data using the isohyetal method can be affected by several factors, including the number of gages used to draw the isohyets, the homogeneity of the meteorological conditions that generated the storm, and the presence of orographic effects. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimate can be influenced by the spatial distribution of gages and the complexity of the rainfall pattern. In areas with sparse gage coverage or complex rainfall patterns, the isohyetal method may not provide accurate estimates of missing rainfall data."}, {"question": "How does the normal-ratio method account for the proportion of the mean annual catch that occurs in a specific storm?", "answer": "The normal-ratio method accounts for the proportion of the mean annual catch that occurs in a specific storm by using the ratio of the rainfall depth at each gage to the average annual catch at that gage.

{"paragraph": "4.3.4 Quadrant Method The station-average method does not account for either the closeness of the other gages to the location of the missing measurement or the density of the raingage network. The normal- ratio method requires information in addition to the storm event catches at all gages; namely, the average annual catch at each gage is required. The isohyetal method requires a reason- ably dense network of gages in order to accurately construct the isohyets. Each of the meth- ods has disadvantages. The quadrant method is an alternative to these other methods. Once again, the esti- P mated catch is a weighted average of catches at other gages, and Equation 4-10 is used. The method is based on two assumptions: (1) catches at gages that are located close to each other are not independent estimates of the catch at the unknown point, and therefore, all k gages are not necessary; and (2) the weight assigned to a gage used to estimate should de- crease as the distance between the gage and the point where an estimate is required increases. To estimate P, the region is divided into four quadrants using north-south and east- west lines that intersect at the point where the catch is missing (point X in Figure 4-8). The coordinates of each gage with respect to the center location are determined and used to com- pute the distance between the gages and the center point. The quadrant method uses only the point in each quadrant that is closest to the center location (that is, point X); this attempts to ensure that the gages used to estimate P are somewhat independent. The weights are defined as a function of the reciprocal of the square of the distance between the gage and the center location X, ~ d : .If there is a gage in each quadrant, the weight for quadrant i is where dii s the distance between gage i and the center location. In some cases, there may not be a gage in one or more quadrants or a gage may be too far from the center point to have a significant weight. In such cases, the summation in the de- Precipitation Chap. 4 FIGURE 4-8 Rain gage location for estimating storm rainfall by using the quadrant method. nominator of Equation 4-15 will be over those quadrants that include a gage that yields a significant weight. The delineation of quadrants does not have to be based on a north-south, east-west axis system.

In such cases, the reasons for adopting the alternative system should be clearly stated.

Only these four gages are used to compute the weights and estimate P. Since gage C is closest to point X, it has the largest weight. It is of interest to note that gage A is not used to estimate P even though it is the second closest gage to point X; it is not used because gage C is in the same quadrant and closer to point X. Even though gage His much farther from point X, it is used to estimate P because it is in a different quadrant and, therefore, assumed to be an independent estimate of the rainfall at point X.

{"paragraph": "4.4 GAGE CONSISTENCY Estimating missing data is one problem that hydrologists need to address. A second problem occurs when the catch at rain gages is inconsistent over a period of time and adjustment of the measured data is necessary to provide a consistent record. A consistent record is one where the characteristics of the record have not changed with time. Adjusting for gage con- sistency involves the estimation of an effect rather than a missing value. An inconsistent record may result from any one of a number of events; specifically, adjustment may be nec- essary due to changes in observation procedures, changes in exposure of the gage, changes in land use that make it impractical to maintain the gage at the old location, and where vandal- ism frequently occurs. Double-mass-curve analysis is the method that is used to check for an inconsistency in a gaged record. A double-mass cuwe is a graph of the cumulative catch at the rain gage of in- terest versus the cumulative catch of one or more gages in the region that has been subjected to similar hydrometeorological occurrences and are known to be consistent. If a rainfall record is a consistent estimator of the hydrometeorological occurrences over the period of record, the double-mass curve will have a constant slope. A change in the slope of the double- mass curve would suggest that an external factor has caused changes in the character of the measured values. If a change in slope is evident, then the record needs to be adjusted, with ei- ther the early or later period of record adjusted. Conceptually, adjustment is nothing more than changing the values so that the slope of the resulting double-mass curve is a straight line. The method of adjustment is easily understood with the schematic of Figure 4-9. The double-mass curve between the cumulative regional catch X and the cumulative catch at the gage Y where a check for consistency is needed is characterized by two sections, which are denoted in Figure 4-9 by the subscripts 1 and 2. The slopes of the two sections, S, and S ,, can be computed from the cumulative catches: A Yi S. = -ax-, ' in which Sii s the slope of section i, AY, is the change in the cumulative catch for gage Y be- tween the endpoints of the section i, and AXi is the change in the cumulative catch for the sum of the regional gages between the endpoints of section i. Either section of the double-mass curve can be adjusted for consistency.

If the gage has been relocated only temporarily or if the exposure at the gage adversely affected the catch for a brief period, it would be of interest to adjust the latter part of the record so that it would be consistent with the initial part of the record; this adjustment will make the latter part of the record consistent with both the initial part of the record and the data that will be collected in the future. If it is of interest to adjust the initial part of the record of station Y , then S,, which is based on Y, and X,, is correct, and it is necessary to adjust the Y, values. The adjustment will provide an adjusted series of data, which will be denoted as y,. If S, is correct, the slope S, should be removed from Y, and replaced with slope S,; this adjustment is made by in which the ratio S,/S, is the adjustment factor. The adjustment is shown in Figure 4-9b. By multiplying each value in the Y, series by the adjustment factor of Equation 4-17, a series y, that has the same slope as the upper section, Y,, will be produced.

The intent is to replace the slope of the upper section with the slope of the lower section (see Figure 4-9c). The adjusted values are computed by Dividing by S2 removes the effect of the existing slope and replaces it with S, through multi- plication by S,. The series y2 will have slope S,.

{"paragraph": "4.5 AVERAGE AREAL RAINFALL For analyses involving areas larger than a few square miles, it may be necessary to make es- timates of average rainfall depths over subwatershed areas. Two of the more common prob- lems where this type of analysis could be used is in the computation of the probable maxi- mum flood for larger watersheds and in the analysis of actual storm events in which the 198 Precipitation Chap. 4 rainfall depths were measured at more than one rain gage. The probable maximum flood is used in the design of many large structures. The analysis of actual storm events, such as hur- ricanes, may be required for legal cases involving flooding or to assess the effect of the larger storms of record on a proposed structure. In these design cases, it is necessary to ex- tend the point rainfall measurements to areal estimates. Three methods of extending point estimates to areal averages will be presented. The station-average method is the simplest to apply; however, when the rain gages are not uni- formly dispersed throughout the watershed, the station-average method may not provide an areal average rainfall that reflects the actual spatial distribution of rainfall. For such cases, a method that can account for the nonhomogeneity of the rain gage locations would provide a more accurate estimate of the actual rainfall depth. Two such methods will be demonstrated. The Theissen Polygon Method assigns weights to the rain gages according to the proportions of the total watershed area that are geographically closest to each of the rain gages. The iso- hyetal method, which should be more accurate than the Theissen Polygon Method, weights the catch at each of the rain gages according to the watershed area that is physically associ- ated with the catch of the rain gage. Whereas the Theissen Method is easier to apply and is more reproducible (that is, different individuals would be more likely to provide the same es- timates) than the isohyetal method, the isohyetal method permits the hydrologist to incorpo- rate orographic effects and storm morphology into the calculation of the weights. In sum- mary, each of the three methods can be viewed as providing a weighted average of measured catches. The station-average method assumes equal weights. The weights for the Theissen Method are proportional to the size of the area geographically closest to each gage. The iso- hyetal method assigns weights on the basis of storm morphology, the spatial distribution of the rain gages, and orographic effects. As a general model, the average watershed catch is defined by in which P is the average rainfall, Piis the rainfall measured at station i, n the number of rain gages, and w iis the weight assigned to the catch at station i. The mean P has the same units as the Pi.E quation 4-21 is valid only when the following holds: The general model of Equation 4-21 can be applied with all the methods discussed here.

{"paragraph": "4.5.3 Isohyetal Method The Theissen Method is considered to be more accurate than the station-average method. But the Theissen Method does not allow the hydrologist to consider factors, such as topography, that can affect the catch at a gage in delineating areas in which the catch at the gage is repre- sentative. The isohyetal method is designed to overcome this deficiency. Specifically, the isohyetal method requires the hydrologist to delineate the boundaries of the region associated with the catch at each gage by drawing isohyets (that is, lines of equal rainfall depths). The area within each pair of adjacent isohyets can then be used to weight the average rainfall as- sociated with the adjacent isohyets. Mathematically, the estimated mean areal precipitation for a watershed of area A is in which A; is the area of the watershed between isohyets i and i + 1, Pi is the average precip- + itation for isohyets i and i 1, and n the number of isohyetal intervals. The ratio A,IA is the weight applied to the particular precipitation range. Sec. 4.5 Average Areal Rainfall 201 While the opportunity to incorporate knowledge of the factors affecting the catch at each gage into making a weighted estimate is an advantage of the isohyetal method, it is also its disadvantage. Specifically, the drawing of the isohyets is somewhat subjective when the network of rain gages is not dense. Thus two or more hydrologists will not necessarily arrive at the same rainfall pattern, which will result in unequal estimates of the weighted average rainfall. Thus the accuracy of this method is dependent on the knowledge and skill of the hy- drologist. Additionally, the accuracy is dependent on the density of the rain gage network. It is difficult to accurately delineate the isohyets when there are only a few rain gages.

It should be ob- vious that there are a large number of possible isohyetal patterns that could be constructed from the data for the five gages. For this hypothetical example, the catches given in Table 4-8 were actually obtained from the isohyetal pattern shown in Figure 4-12c. The isohyets of Figure 4-12c can be used to estimate the average rainfall; the calculations are shown in Table 4-8, with the drainage area divided into eleven subareas. For each pair of isohyets, the average of the rain- fall amounts is used to represent the of Equation 4-25. The weight of w io f Equation 4-21 is taken to be the fraction of the area between the isohyets.

This weight is used to calculate the estimated mean areal precipitation, taking into account the varying rainfall depths across the watershed. By using this ratio, the isohyetal method can provide a more accurate estimate of mean areal precipitation by accounting for the spatial distribution of rainfall."}, {"question": "How does the density of the rain gage network impact the accuracy of the isohyetal method?", "answer": "The density of the rain gage network significantly impacts the accuracy of the isohyetal method, as a denser network provides more data points for delineating isohyets. With a dense network, hydrologists can more accurately draw isohyets, leading to a more precise estimate of mean areal precipitation. In contrast, a sparse network can lead to subjective and inaccurate isohyetal patterns, resulting in reduced accuracy of the estimated mean areal precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of the isohyetal method, why are the values of P_i considered average values between isohyets and within the watershed?", "answer": "The values of P_i are considered average values between isohyets and within the watershed because they represent the average rainfall amounts between adjacent isohyets, rather than values recorded at individual gages. This is in contrast to the station-average and Theissen Methods, which use values recorded at individual gages. By using average values between isohyets, the isohyetal method can provide a more detailed and accurate representation of rainfall distribution across the watershed."}, {"question": "What is the primary advantage of the isohyetal method over other methods, such as the station-average and Theissen Methods?", "answer": "The primary advantage of the isohyetal method is its ability to incorporate knowledge of factors affecting the catch at each gage, such as topography, into the estimation of mean areal precipitation. This allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of rainfall distribution, making it a valuable tool for hydrologists."}, {"question": "In the context of the isohyetal method, how do hydrologists estimate the average rainfall for each pair of adjacent isohyets?", "answer": "Hydrologists estimate the average rainfall for each pair of adjacent isohyets by using the average of the rainfall amounts associated with the adjacent isohyets. This average value is then used to represent the rainfall amount for the area between the isohyets, allowing for a more detailed and accurate estimate of mean areal precipitation."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to accurately delineate isohyets when there are only a few rain gages?", "answer": "It is challenging to accurately delineate isohyets when there are only a few rain gages because the limited data points can lead to subjective and inaccurate isohyetal patterns. With a sparse network, hydrologists may have to make assumptions or interpolations to draw isohyets, which can result in reduced accuracy of the estimated mean areal precipitation. A denser network of rain gages is necessary to provide more data points and increase the accuracy of isohyetal delineation."}]}
{"paragraph": "4.5.4 Average Rainfall for Subwatersheds In making a watershed analysis, it is often necessary to divide the watershed into subareas to account for nonhomogeneity of land use or soil characteristics. Also, some hydrologic mod- 202 Precipitation Chap. 4 els place limits on the size of subareas; in such cases, watershed subdivision is also neces- sary. In these cases, the average rainfall may have to be estimated for each subarea, and one of the methods above for computing average rainfalls will have to be applied to each subarea separately. When using the station-average method, a decision rule must be developed for assign- ing gages to specific subareas. For example, for the subdivided watershed of Figure 4-12b, would one use gages A, B, and C for computing the average for subarea 1 and gages D and E for subarea 2? This may seem rational, but the Theissen weight for Theissen section C in subarea 2 is still larger than the weight for section D (that is, 0.222 versus 0.126); this sug- gests that rainfall for gage C is possibly more indicative of the rainfall on subarea 2 than the catch at gage D. In any case, the decision rule is not as clear with the station-average method as it is with the Theissen Polygon Method. The isohyetal method can be used with a subdivided watershed by computing the weights according to the parts of the isohyets that are located within each subarea. The iso- hyets should be developed in the same manner regardless of the way the watershed is subdi- vided. Example 4-14 Consider the hypothetical watershed of Figure 4-12. If we assume that the watershed is divided into two equal subareas, as shown in Figure 4-12b, the weights for Equation 4-21 must now be calculated for each subwatershed. For the Theissen Method these are shown in Table 4-9. Using Equation 4-21, we get the following weighted average rainfalls for the subareas: P, + + = 3.90(0.286) 3.35(0.236) 3.55(0.478) (4-27 a) = 3.60 in. p, + + + = 3.35(0.002) 3.55(0.222) 3.50(0.126) 3.10(0.650) (4-27 b) = 3.25 in. Within the limits of roundoff accuracy, the mean watershed rainfall for the subdivided watershed equals the mean obtained by not subdividing: - + P = OS(3.60) OS(3.25) = 3.425 in.

{"paragraph": "4.6 DEVELOPMENT OF A DESIGN STORM To this point, the following characteristics of storms have been discussed: volume, duration, frequency, and intensity. Some design problems only require the total volume of rainfall for a specified duration and frequency. However, for many problems in hydrologic design, it is necessary to show the variation of the rainfall volume with time. That is, some hydrologic design problems require the storm input to the design method to be expressed as a hyeto- graph and not just as a total volume for the storm. Characteristics of a hyetograph that are important are the peak, the time to peak, and the distribution, as well as the volume, duration, and frequency. In developing a design storm for any region, empirical analyses of measured rainfall records are made to determine the most likely arrangement of the ordinates of the hyetograph. For example, some storm events will have an early peak (front loaded), some a late peak (rear loaded), some will peak in the center of the storm (center loaded), and some will have more than one peak.

For instance, if a design storm underestimates the peak rainfall intensity, the resulting drainage system may be insufficient to handle the actual rainfall, leading to flooding and damage.

{"paragraph": "4.6.1 Constant-Intensity Design Storm A design storm that is used frequently for hydrologic designs on very small urban water- sheds is the constant-intensity storm. It is quite common to assume that the critical cause of flooding is the short-duration, high-intensity storm. Therefore, it is assumed that for the criti- cal storm duration, the rainfall intensity will be constant. It is common to assume that the largest peak runoff rate occurs when the entire drainage area is contributing, which leads to the assumption that the duration of the design storm equals the time of concentration of the watershed. The intensity of the storm is obtained from an intensity-duration-frequency curve for the location, often using the time of concentration as the duration and the frequency spec- ified by the design standard; the storm volume is the intensity multiplied by the time of con- centration. Uses of this design storm are discussed in other chapters. Example 4-15 To illustrate the constant intensity design storm, we will assume the following condition: (1) the design standard specifies a 10-yr retum period for design; (2) the watershed time of concentra- tion is 15 min; and (3) the watershed is located in Baltimore, Maryland. From Figure 4-4 the rainfall intensity for a duration of 15 min is 5.5 in./hr, which yields a storm volume of 1.375 in. The resulting design storm is shown in Figure 4-13.

{"paragraph": "4.6.2 The SCS 24-Hour Storm Distributions The SCS developed four dimensionless rainfall distributions using the Weather Bureau's Rainfall Frequency Atlases (NWS, 1961). The rainfall-frequency data for areas less than 400 mi', for durations to 24 hr, and for frequencies from 1 yr to 100 yr were used. Data analyses indicated four major regions, and the resulting rainfall distributions were labeled type I, IA, 11, and 111. The locations where these design storms are applicable are shown in Figure 4-14. The distributions are based on the generalized rainfall volume-duration-frequency rela- tionships shown in technical publications of the Weather Bureau. Rainfall depths for dura- tions from 6 min to 24-hr were obtained from the volume-duration-frequency information in these publications and used to derive the storm distributions. Using increments of 6 min, in- cremental rainfall depths were determined. For example, the maximum 6-min depth was sub- tracted from the maximum 12-min depth and this 12-min depth was subtracted from the maximum 18-min depth, and so on to 24 hours. The distributions were formed by arranging these 6-min incremental depths such that for any duration from 6 min to 24 hr, the rainfall depth for that duration and frequency is represented as a continuous sequence of 6-min depths. The location of the peak was found from the analysis of measured storm events to be location dependent. For the regions with type I and IA storms, the peak intensity occurred at a storm time of about 8 hr, while for the regions with type I1 and 111 storms, the peak was found to occur at the center of the storm. Therefore for type I1 and 111 storm events, the great- est 6-min depth is assumed to occur at about the middle of the 24-hr period, the second largest 6-min incremental depth during the next 6 min and the third largest in the 6-min inter- FIGURE 4-14 Approximate geographic areas for SCS rainfall distributions. (SCS, 1986.) Sec. 4.6 Development of a Design Storm 205 val precelng the maximum intensity. This continues with each incremental rainfall depth in decreasing order of magnitude. Thus the smaller increments fall at the beginning and end of the 24-hr storm. This procedure results in the maximum 6-min depth being contained within the maximum 1-hr depth, the maximum 1-hr depth is contained within the maximum 6-hr depth, and so on. Because all of the critical storm depths are contained within the storm dis- tributions, the distributions are appropriate for designs on both small and large watersheds. This procedure can be used to show the values of the cumulative rainfall distribution of the SCS type I1 storm for a time increment of 0.25 hr; the values are given in Table 4-10 for hyetograph times from 10.00 to 14.00 hr. The largest incremental rainfall (27.6%) occurred between hyetograph times 11.75 and 12.00 hr. The next largest (10.4%) was placed just prior to the largest incremental amount. The third largest (4.4%) was placed just after the largest incremental amount. This procedure is followed approximately for the remainder of the storm. The resulting distributions (Figure 4-15) are most often presented with the ordinates given on a dimensionless scale. The SCS type I and type 11 dimensionless distributions plot as a straight line on log-log paper. Although they do not agree exactly with ZDF values from all locations in the region for which they are intended, the differences are within the accuracy of the rainfall depths read from the Weather Bureau atlases. Figure 4-15 shows the distribu- tions, and the ordinates are given in Table 4-1 1 for all four SCS synthetic design storms. Example 4-16 The procedure of forming a design storm can be illustrated with a simplified example.

The depth (that is, duration times intensity) is shown in column 4, with the incremental depth (column 5) taken as the difference between the depths for durations 1 hr apart. The incremental depths were used to form the 50-yr design storm, which is shown in column 6, by placing the largest incremental depth in hour 3 and the second largest incremental depth in hour 4. The remaining incremental depths were placed by alternating their location before and after the maximum incremental depth. It is important to notice that the maxi- mum three hours of the design storm has a volume of 3.90 in., which is the depth for a 3-hr dura- tion from Figure 4-4; this will be true for any storm duration from 1 to 6 hr. The cumulative form of the design storm is given in column 7 of Table 4-12. A dimensionless design storm can be developed by transforming the cumulative design storm of column 7 of Table 4-12 by dividing each ordinate by the total depth of 4.62 in. The di- mensionless cumulative design storm derived from the 50-yr intensities is shown in column 8 of Table 4-12. The calculation of a dimensionless design storm for a 2-yr frequency is shown in the lower part of Table 4-12. In comparing the 50-yr and 2-yr dimensionless design storms, it should be apparent that a cumulative design storm could be developed for any design frequency by multiplying the 6-hr rainfall depth for that frequency by the average ordinates of the dimen- sionless cumulative design storms of Table 4-12, which is approximately [0.05. 0.14,0.77,0.89, 0.97, 1.001.

{"paragraph": "4.6.3 Comparison of Design Storms Concern about the 24-hr duration of the SCS design storms has been expressed. The argu- ment is that flooding on small watersheds results from short duration storms, not 24-hr storms. Many prefer the constant-intensity design storm even though such a storm is unlikely to occur because storms usually begin and end with a period of low intensity. In this regard, the SCS design storms are rational.

Determination of 6-Hour incremental rainfall. To obtain the 6-hr incremental PMP, depth-area-duration (DAD) data are obtained from HMR No. 51 (Figures 18 to 47) for the location of the watershed. The geographic center of the watershed is usually used in ob- taining the DAD data. The center is determined using the method outlined in Section 3.3.5. Because of the necessity to interpolate for standard isohyet areas, relationships be- tween the DAD data and storm-area size (A,) will be necessary. For graphical relationships, the storm-area size should be plotted on the log scale of sernilog graph paper. The curves should be plotted so that they are parallel or converging with increasing size; the conver- gence should be such that the lines will not cross. Alternatively, sernilog relationships can be developed for all durations (6, 12, 24,48, and 72 hours): After obtaining values for a and b for each duration, the coefficients should be adjusted to ensure rational estimates. Using either the graphical or semilog equations, DAD values should be obtained for standard isohyet-area sizes, with at least four values smaller and four values larger than the storm-area size corresponding to the maximum precipitation volume. To obtain DAD estimates for the 18-hr duration, relationships between the DAD data and the duration are obtained for the storm-area sizes from the previous step. Graphical rela- tionships on linear paper can be used or polynomial equations can be fitted. In either case, adjusting may be necessary to ensure reasonable estimates of the 18-hr depth. Placement of the isohyetal pattern. Figure 4-6 shows the isohyetal pattern used to distribute the rainfall over the watershed. The spatial concentration of rainfall is de- termined largely by the location of the storm center and the orientation of the storm pattern. HMR No. 52 recommends centering the isohyetal pattern over the drainage area such that the runoff volume will be the greatest. This recommendation is based on the assumption of high correlation between the peak discharge and the maximum volume of runoff. While this cor- relation is usually high, it is good practice to move the storm center slightly closer to the wa- tershed outlet since the upper reaches of a watershed are often less important in determining the maximum discharge. The greatest peak flow is more likely to correlate with the greatest volume when the watershed is not subdivided for analysis. This occurs because the channel routing scheme assumes less storage than that assumed by the unit hydrograph. Irregularly shaped watersheds may require more analyses than a regularly shaped watershed. The location of the storm center is fairly straightforward for homogeneous water- sheds. Where there are significant variations in land coveriuse, soils, or channel character- Sec. 4.7 Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) 21 1 istics, finding the optimum storm center location may be more involved. The existence of storage reservoirs also can be an important factor. In the SCS TR-55, a peak discharge cor- rection factor, which reduces the design peak discharge, is used to adjust for the presence of small storage volumes. The correction factor depends on the location of the storage, with a larger correction factor being used when the storage is near the watershed outlet. While the TR-55 procedure is intended for use on small watersheds, the basic concept is still valid. The locational effects of detention storage have also been widely discussed with refer- ence to detention ponds in urban areas. Studes have shown that, when the detention basins are located near the outlet of the basin, the effect can be to increase the peak discharge over that which would have occurred even without the detention storage. The argument is as fol- lows: Storage basins tend to delay the time of the peak of the hydrograph out of the detention basin, thus giving the upstream flow the time to drain to the area of the downstream drainage facility. Thus, the peak of the upstream hydrograph occurs at about the time of the peak flow out of the detention facility. The point is, storage can alter the runoff characteristics for a wa- tershed and it is necessary to perform more analyses to identify the maximum peak dis- charge. There is a need for guidelines on locating the storm center for a developed watershed that includes significant amounts of detention storage. If the storage facilities are distributed over the entire watershed, then the storm center will need to be positioned near the center of the watershed. However, additional analyses need to be made. The storm center should first be moved closer to the watershed outlet. Several runs can be made with the storm center moved successively farther from the center of the watershed until the optimum is found. The extent of the storage will be a determining factor in finding the optimum storm positioning. Also, the interdependence of storage structures on the same tributary is a factor. In general, the effect of a storage facility is to delay the time of the peak of the outflow and reduce the peak. However, structures don't have a large effect on the volume of runoff, which itself is a determinant of the peak discharge at the watershed outlet. If the detention structures are located in one portion of the watershed rather than being uniformly distributed over the entire watershed, the effects are easier to describe. When the structures are predominantly in the headwaters of the watershed, the delay in the flow through the structures essentially reduces the contributing effects of the upper portion of the watershed. Thus, the storm center will be closer to the watershed outlet. Conversely, if the structures are concentrated near the outlet, then the delay of the flow through the structures can cause relatively large increases in peak discharges because the delay enables the water from the upstream portion of the watershed to \"catch up\" with the flow going through the structures. The elongated, flat peak of the hydrograph out of the structures combines with the peak of the flow from upstream to produce the peak of the total flow. In this case, the storm center should be located more in the portion of the watershed away from the structures, which means the storm center is above the center of the watershed. This will give a larger peak from the upstream portion of the watershed, which will combine with the volume and flat peak of the portion of the watershed that is controlled by the structure. The problem of locating the storm center is compounded by the need to provide equal protection at every hydrologic facility in the watershed. Assume that the 100-yr storm is used for all design work. This implies that the runoff will have a 100-yr exceedence fre- quency. But the 100-yr storm for the entire watershed will not provide a 100-yr runoff at 212 Precipitation Chap. 4 every point within the watershed. It will only provide 100-yr runoff at the outlet. Designs at other points in the watershed will require separate analyses including the proper positioning of the design isohyets to achieve the maximum peak at the interior design point. Use of the 100-yr rainfall pattern for design within the entire watershed will lead to underdesigned fa- cilities. The largest peak discharge must be considered as the 100-yr peak, so this will occur only when the optimum design storm is evaluated separately for each site within the water- shed. There are several factors that can make the problem more complex. First, if there are points within a watershed that act to control runoff rates, such as pipes designed for a small return period, these can cause surcharges. In such cases, the hydrologic facilities act like storage structures. Second, assumed antecedent moisture conditions are important when the watershed does not have uniform land cover. The positioning of the storm center will be more sensitive to the location of the undeveloped land and less to the urbanized land, espe- cially if dry initial conditions are used. Third, the shape of the watershed must also be con- sidered in positioning the storm center. Small parcels of land that are at the extreme headwa- ter of the watershed may not contribute to the peak so they can be ignored when positioning the storm isohyets. Determination of maximum precipitation volume. The objective of this step is to determine the maximum precipitation volume for the three largest 6-hr time increments. This requires a somewhat subjective step of moving the isohyetal pattern over the drainage area and assessing the volume at each trial location. The area in each isohyet can be com- puted graphically or planimetered and used to compute the rainfall volume. The watershed should be completely covered by the isohyetal pattern and all partial areas used to compute the volume. Distribute the storm-area averaged PMP. The 6-hr incremental depths equal the incremental PMP divided by the drainage area. For cases where increments less than 6 hr are needed, the depth-duration curve should be used. HMR 52 provides a figure for interpo- lating ratios of the 1-hr to 6-hr rainfall. Determine the temporal distribution of the PMS. The temporal distribution is formed in much the same way as the SCS 24-hr design storms (see Section 4.6.2). The in- dividual 6-hr ordinates are arranged in decreasing proportion about the maximum 6-hr ordi- nate. HMR 52 indicates that large storms are usually rear loaded, so the maximum 6-hr ordi- nate should not be placed within the first 24 hr of the 72-hr storm. HMR 52 does not state the specific sequence. It is usually better to analyze rainfall records from nearby gages and deter- mine the temporal distribution of recent large events. Such information can be used in devel- oping an appropriate temporal pattern. Determine temporal distributions for subwatersheds. Large watersheds will most often be subdivided into subwatersheds that are relatively homogeneous in hy- drometeorological characteristics. The volumes for each subwatershed need to be consistent with the isohyetal pattern for the entire watershed. Subareas not near the location of the cen- Sec. 4.8 Summary 213 ter of the isohyetal pattern will have smaller volumes. However, the same temporal pattern of rainfall must be used for each subarea.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of design storms, why is there concern about the 24-hr duration of the SCS design storms?", "answer": "The concern arises because flooding on small watersheds often results from short-duration storms, not 24-hr storms, suggesting that the SCS design storms may not accurately represent the typical storm patterns that lead to flooding in these areas."}, {"question": "How do detention storage facilities affect the runoff characteristics of a watershed?", "answer": "Detention storage facilities can alter the runoff characteristics by delaying the time of the peak of the hydrograph out of the detention basin, thus giving the upstream flow time to drain to the area of the downstream drainage facility. This can lead to an increase in the peak discharge over that which would have occurred even without the detention storage, especially when the detention basins are located near the outlet of the basin.

If the storage facilities are distributed over the entire watershed, the storm center should be positioned near the center of the watershed. However, if the structures are concentrated near the outlet, the storm center should be located more in the portion of the watershed away from the structures.

{"paragraph": "4.8 SUMMARY Watershed characteristics and precipitation are necessary inputs to many hydrologic design methods. For designs based on rainfall, the rainfall represents an upper limit on the amount of water that must be considered in the design. For a small asphalt parlung lot in an urban &ea, almost all of the rainfall will run off immediately, so the success of the outlet design will depend largely on the accuracy of the design rainfall estimate. For a large forested wa- tershed of several hundred square miles, a design may be less sensitive to the accuracy of the rainfall input; however, the rainfall characteristics will still be important to the design. The degree of importance of the rainfall input also depends on the effect of watershed and chan- nel storage. In the small parking lot, there is very little storage, and thus the outflow is much more sensitive to the input (the rainfall). In the case of the large forested watershed, large amounts of storage in the form of interception, depression, subsurface, and channel storage decrease the sensitivity of the outflow from the watershed to the rainfall input. Thus, the im- portance of rainfall and watershed characteristics varies with the design problem but both re- main important determinants of the final design.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design methods, what are the necessary inputs?", "answer": "Watershed characteristics and precipitation are necessary inputs to many hydrologic design methods."}, {"question": "How does the size of a watershed affect the sensitivity of outflow to rainfall input?", "answer": "The sensitivity of outflow to rainfall input decreases with the size of the watershed due to increased storage in the form of interception, depression, subsurface, and channel storage, which buffers the impact of rainfall on outflow."}, {"question": "Why is the accuracy of the design rainfall estimate crucial for the success of outlet design in a small asphalt parking lot?", "answer": "The accuracy of the design rainfall estimate is crucial for the success of outlet design in a small asphalt parking lot because almost all of the rainfall will run off immediately, and there is very little storage to buffer the outflow, making the outflow highly sensitive to the input."}, {"question": "In the case of a large forested watershed, how do storage mechanisms affect the design sensitivity to rainfall input?", "answer": "In a large forested watershed, large amounts of storage in the form of interception, depression, subsurface, and channel storage decrease the sensitivity of the outflow from the watershed to the rainfall input. This is because these storage mechanisms can absorb and delay the release of water, thereby reducing the peak flow rates and making the design less sensitive to the accuracy of the rainfall input.

However, it also necessitates a thorough understanding of these storage mechanisms and their capacities to accurately predict the hydrologic response of the watershed and design effective hydrologic systems.

{"paragraph": "4.8.1 Analysis and Synthesis Most of the concepts discussed in this chapter relate to the design or synthesis phase; little at- tention has been given to the analysis problem. In terms of the systems framework intro- duced in Chapter 1, the measured rainfall record is the input, and rainfall intensity-duration- frequency characteristics are one type of output. An important task in rainfall analysis is to transform measured rainfall data into IDF characteristic curves such as those displayed in Figure 4-4. The method of making such a transformation was not introduced in this chapter since it is a task that is more involved than would be appropriate for an introductory text; however, the general approach is based on frequency analysis (see Chapter 5). The topics discussed in this chapter represent problems in synthesis. Using an IDF curve to develop a synthetic hyetograph uses the IDF curve as input and a procedure or set of decision rules for setting up the output, which is the design storm. Depth-area-duration curves, which have been derived from the analysis of many measured storm events, serve as a model for converting a point rainfall depth to an area averaged rainfall depth; thus figures such as Figure 4-7 serve as the transformation tool. The methods of estimating areal aver- ages of rainfall volumes are models that synthesize areal averages from point rainfall esti- mates. Analysis of actual storm event data have shown that the methods provide reasonable approximations. The same is true for the methods that are used to estimate missing rainfall data, although these methods may also be used as part of a method in precipitation analysis. In summary, this chapter has centered on discussions of methods used for design pur- poses. It has been assumed that the products of rainfall analyses are available for solving de- sign problems and that problems in rainfall analysis are more involved than would be appro- priate to outline here.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to malung technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1 What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? 226 Precipitation Chap. 4 You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. A hydrologist is hired as a consultant on a legal case. A small shopping mall, behind which is a stream, was flooded. The owners of the stores in the mall sue the owners of a large arena that was built five years earlier upstream of the mall. The arena has a large paved parking lot, which the store owners argue caused the flood levels to increase. They in- dicate that they had never experienced flooding in the twenty years prior to the construction of the arena. The hydrologist is hired by the owners of the arena. In making his analysis, the hydrologist collects data for the storm event from the four rain gages in the region. None of the gages are located in the 32-mi2 watershed that drains to the location of the mall. The hy- drologist wants to show that the flooding occurred because the storm was unusually large, not because of the impervious area on the arena owner's land. In computing a weighted aver- age rainfall, the hydrologist elects not to include one gage in the analysis because it has a much lower total storm rainfall than the other three gages. Including the rainfall from the one station would reduce the strength of the hydrologist's argument that the arena was not a fac- tor in the flooding. The hydrologist omits any reference to the one gage in his report.

The implications for urban hydrology and flood risk management are substantial, as increased imperviousness can exacerbate flood risks, necessitating the implementation of stormwater management practices and flood mitigation measures to reduce the impact of urbanization on hydrological systems."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.1 INTRODUCTION Hydrologic design centers around runoff, not the rainfall that generates the runoff or the wa- tershed processes that transform the rainfall into runoff. Like rainfall, runoff is a function of time and space. Imagine standing near a stream during a very heavy rainfall. At the start of the storm the water level in the stream would probably be relatively low; the stream bed might even be dry. After a period of time the water level would begin to rise, especially shortly after a heavy burst of rainfall. At some point in time, the rainfall rate would taper off and shortly thereafter, the level in the stream would reach its highest level. The rainfall might then stop and the level of the water in the stream would start to decrease. The time that it takes to decrease from the time of the highest level to the level that existed prior to the start of rainfall is usually much longer than the time that it took to reach the maximum level. This brief description of a rainfall-runoff event can be used to illustrate several points. 5.1 . I Hydrographs and Discharge In Chapter 4 the time sequence of rainfall was called a hyetograph. The time sequence of runoff is called a hydrograph. If you had taken measurements of the level of water in the stream above some datum, such as the bottom of the channel, at regular intervals of time, say every minute or every five minutes, a stage hydrograph of water level versus time could be plotted. The variation in the stage hydrograph would probably show some degree of associa- tion with the variation in the rainfall hyetograph, although the watershed processes usually smooth out much of the variation in the hyetograph. Table 5-1 gives the daily discharge hy- drograph for the 1984 water year for the Northeast Branch of the Anacostia River at hverdale, MD. The minimum occurred over a four-day period in September. The maximum mean daily discharge occurred on March 29. The maximum of 2190 ft3/sec was much less than the maximum record of 12,000 ft3/sec (June 22, 1972). While a stage hydrograph is important, hydrographs are usually reported in terms of the discharge rate, which has units of length cubed per unit time; for example, the discharge might be reported in cubic feet per second, cubic meters per second, or acre-feet per day. These units reflect the relationship between the cross-sectional area of the stream (A) and the average velocity of flow (V),w hich are related by the continuity equation, q = AV, in which q is the discharge rate. It is important to note that A in the continuity equation is the cross- sectional area of the stream and not the drainage area of the watershed, which is also com- 230 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE S 1 Mean Daily Discharge (ft3/sec) Record for the 1984 Water Year (Oct. 1983 to Sept. 1984) for Gage 01 649500 Northeast Branch Anacostia River at Riverdale, MD Day Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2 1 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 3 1 MEAN MIN IN.

The relationship between the depth of flow and the discharge is often assumed to have the following form: in which h is the depth of flow and a and b are constants for a particular stream section. The depth of flow and the area of the cross section are related geometrically.

{"paragraph": "5.1.2 Rainfall-Runoff Association As suggested above, the rates of rainfall and runoff are correlated. A sudden burst of rainfall can noticeably change the trend of a hydrograph. However, the watershed and channel processes that affect the transformation of rainfall to runoff smooth out many of the extreme variations in the rainfall; this is especially true of large watersheds and watersheds where there is a lot of storage, such as in a heavily forested basin. For small urban watersheds, such as an asphalt-covered parking lot, the opportunity for smoothing by watershed processes is less, so the common variations in rainfall and runoff would be more evident. Figure 5-2 shows the hyetograph and four hydrographs for a storm in Los Angeles. The rainfall was measured in the Eaton Wash watershed, and the rain gage is the only gage in the vicinity of the four urban watersheds, which are adjacent to each other. From Figure 5-2, the association between rainfall and runoff is evident; however, the association is differ- Discharge (cu ftlsec) FIGURE 5-1 Stage-discharge relation for station 34 on Pigeon Roost Creek, Miss.

The difference in the association may be due to the spa- tial variation in the rainfall on the four watersheds or because of differences in the watershed processes of the four watersheds. The large burst of rainfall at about 19 hr has a different ef- fect on each of the four watersheds. On Alhambra and Rubio Washes the rainfall results in a spike in the hydrographs. For Eaton and Arcadia Washes the effect is less peaked and sug- gests a greater degree of smoothing by the watershed processes. For the burst of rain at about 12 hr, the runoff on Arcadia Wash is the largest for the storm, while for the other three watersheds the peak runoff at about 12 hr is less than the peaks at about 9 hr. This may be due to either spatial variability in rainfall that cannot be assessed because data for only one rain gage is available or because of differences in watershed processes over the four water- sheds.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of rainfall-runoff association, how do watershed and channel processes affect the transformation of rainfall to runoff?", "answer": "Watershed and channel processes smooth out many of the extreme variations in rainfall, especially in large watersheds or those with significant storage, such as heavily forested basins. This smoothing effect is less pronounced in small urban watersheds like asphalt-covered parking lots, where the opportunity for smoothing is reduced. As a result, variations in rainfall and runoff are more evident in these urban areas."}, {"question": "Why do small urban watersheds, such as an asphalt-covered parking lot, exhibit a stronger correlation between rainfall and runoff compared to larger watersheds?", "answer": "Small urban watersheds have less opportunity for smoothing by watershed processes due to their size and lack of storage, making the variations in rainfall and runoff more directly correlated. In contrast, larger watersheds with more storage can absorb and release water more gradually, reducing the direct impact of rainfall on runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of the Los Angeles storm, what can be inferred about the spatial variation in rainfall across the four urban watersheds?", "answer": "The difference in the association between rainfall and runoff for each of the four watersheds may be due to spatial variation in the rainfall or differences in watershed processes. The fact that the large burst of rainfall at about 19 hours has a different effect on each watershed suggests that either the rainfall itself varied spatially or the watersheds responded differently to the same rainfall event. This highlights the challenge of assessing spatial variability in rainfall with limited data, such as having only one rain gage available."}, {"question": "How do differences in watershed processes among the four urban watersheds in Los Angeles affect the runoff response to rainfall?", "answer": "Differences in watershed processes, such as the degree of smoothing by storage and absorption, affect how each watershed responds to rainfall. For example, Eaton and Arcadia Washes show a less peaked response to the large burst of rainfall, indicating a greater degree of smoothing by watershed processes compared to Alhambra and Rubio Washes. This variability in response suggests that the characteristics of each watershed, including its size, land cover, and storage capacity, play a significant role in determining the runoff hydrograph."}, {"question": "What implications does the smoothing effect of watershed processes have for understanding rainfall-runoff relationships in different types of watersheds?", "answer": "The smoothing effect of watershed processes has significant implications for understanding rainfall-runoff relationships. In watersheds with substantial storage and smoothing capabilities, the direct correlation between rainfall and runoff may be less apparent, requiring consideration of these processes when analyzing or predicting runoff. Conversely, in areas with minimal smoothing, such as small urban watersheds, the relationship between rainfall and runoff may be more straightforward but also more susceptible to extreme variations. This understanding is crucial for accurate hydrological modeling and prediction."}, {"question": "In the context of the storm in Los Angeles, why does the runoff on Arcadia Wash peak at a different time compared to the other three watersheds?", "answer": "The runoff on Arcadia Wash peaks at a different time, specifically at about 12 hours, which is the largest for the storm, whereas for the other three watersheds, the peak runoff at about 12 hours is less than the peaks at about 9 hours. This difference could be due to either spatial variability in rainfall that cannot be assessed with the available data or differences in watershed processes over the four watersheds. The exact reason remains uncertain without more detailed information on rainfall distribution and watershed characteristics."}, {"question": "How does the presence of storage in a watershed, such as in a heavily forested basin, influence the rainfall-runoff association?", "answer": "The presence of storage in a watershed, such as in a heavily forested basin, significantly influences the rainfall-runoff association by smoothing out extreme variations in rainfall. This storage allows the watershed to absorb and release water more gradually, reducing the direct and immediate impact of rainfall on runoff. As a result, the hydrograph of a watershed with substantial storage will show a less peaked and more smoothed response to rainfall events compared to watersheds without such storage."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological analysis, what challenges are posed by spatial variability in rainfall and differences in watershed processes?", "answer": "Spatial variability in rainfall and differences in watershed processes pose significant challenges for hydrological analysis. These factors can lead to complex and variable runoff responses to rainfall, making it difficult to accurately predict runoff without detailed data on both rainfall distribution and watershed characteristics. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive data, such as having only one rain gage for multiple watersheds, can limit the ability to assess spatial variability in rainfall, thereby complicating the analysis and prediction of rainfall-runoff relationships."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the size and land cover of a watershed when analyzing rainfall-runoff relationships?", "answer": "Considering the size and land cover of a watershed is crucial because"}]}

Precipitation was shown to be a random variable, for which the underlying concepts were in- troduced in Chapter 2.

Runoff can also be viewed as a random variable, so the concept of frequency applies to runoff characteristics as well as to rainfall characteristics. The peak of the discharge hy- drograph is an important design variable, so the frequency of a peak discharge plays a cen- tral role in hydrology.

Frequency modeling is a statistical method that deals with a single random variable and is, thus, classified as a univariate method.

{"paragraph": "5.2.2 Analysis versus Synthesis As with many hydrologic methods that have a statistical basis, the terms analysis and synthe- sis apply to the statistical frequency method. Frequency analysis is the process of \"breaking down\" data in a way that leads to either a mathematical or graphical model of the relation- ship between the flood magnitude and its probability of occurrence. Conversely, synthesis refers to the estimation of either (1) a value of the random variable X for some selected ex- ceedence probability, or (2) the exceedence probability for a selected value of the random variable X. In other words, analysis is the derivation of a model that can represent the rela- tion between the random variable and its likelihood of occurrence, while synthesis refers to the use of the resulting relation for the purposes of estimation. Sac. 5.2 Frequency Analysis and Synthesis 235 It is important to point out that frequency analysis may actually be part of a more elab- orate problem of synthesis. Specifically, separate frequency analyses can be performed at a large number of sites within a region and the value of the random variable X for a selected exceedence probability determined for each site; these values can then be used to develop a regression model using the random variable X as the criterion or dependent variable. As an example, regression equations relating a peak discharge of a selected exceedence probability to watershed characteristics are widely used in hydrologic design. These equations are de- rived by (1) malung a frequency analysis of annual maximum discharges at a number (n) of stream gage stations in a region, (2) selecting the value of the peak discharge from each of the n frequency curves for a selected exceedence probability, say the 100-yr flood, and (3) developing the regression equation relating the n values of peak discharge to watershed characteristics for the same n watersheds.

{"paragraph": "5.2.3 Probability Paper Frequency analysis is a common task in hydrologic studies. A frequency analysis usually produces a graph of the value of a single hydrologic variable versus the probability of its oc- currence. The computed graph represents the best estimate of the statistical population from which the sample of data were drawn. Since frequency analyses are often presented graphically, a special type of graph paper, which is called probability paper, is required. The paper has two axes, with the ordi- nate being used to plot the value of the random variable, and the probability of its occurrence is given on the abscissa. The probability scale will vary depending on the probability distrib- ution being used. In hydrology, the normal and Gumbel extreme-value distributions are the two PDFs used most frequently to define the probability scale. The example of Figure 5-3 uses normal probability paper. The probability scale represents the cumulative normal distri- bution. The scale at the top of the graph is the exceedence probability; the probability that the random variable will be equaled or exceeded in one time period. It changes from 99.99% to 0.01%. The lower scale is the nonexceedence probability, which is the probability that the corresponding value of the random variable will not be exceeded in any one time period. This scale extends from 0.01% to 99.99% The ordinate of probability paper is used for the random variable, such as the peak discharge. The example shown in Figure 5-3 has an arith- metic scale. Log-normal probability paper is also available, with the scale for the random variable in logarithmic form. Gumbel and log-Gumbel papers can also be obtained and used to describe the probabilistic behavior of random variables that follow these probability distri- butions. A frequency curve provides a probabilistic description of the likelihood of occurrence or nonoccurrence of the variable. Figure 5-3 provides an example of a frequency curve, with the value of the random variable X versus its probability of occurrence. The upper probability scale gives the probability of X being exceeded in one time period, while the lower probability scale gives the probability of X not being exceeded. For example, for the frequency curve of Figure 5-3, the probability of X being greater than 7 in one time period 236 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Exceedence Probability (%) 0.010.050.10.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 98 99 99.899.9 99.99 Nonexceedence Probability (%) FIGURE 5-3 Frequency curve for a normal population with p = 5 and cr = 1. is 0.023; therefore, there is a probability of 0.977 of X not being greater than 7 in one time period. Although a unique probability plotting paper could be developed for each probability distribution, probability papers for the normal and extreme-value distributions are the most frequently used probability papers. The probability paper is presented as a cumulative distri- bution function. If the sample of data is from the distribution function that was used to scale the probability paper, the data will follow the pattern of the population line when properly plotted on the paper. If the data do not follow the population line, then either (1) the sample is from a different population or (2) sampling variation has produced a nonrepresentative Sec. 5.2 Frequency Analysis and Synthesis 237 sample.

The nonexceedence probability, on the other hand, represents the probability that the corresponding value of the random variable will not be exceeded in any one time period, ranging from 0.01% to 99.99%.

This cumulative distribution function representation enables the identification of patterns and trends in the data, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the frequency curve. Furthermore, it provides a basis for comparing the observed data with the expected behavior of the population, helping to identify any discrepancies or anomalies that may indicate issues with the data or the chosen probability distribution."}, {"question": "Why are probability papers for the normal and extreme-value distributions the most frequently used in hydrology, despite the possibility of developing unique papers for each distribution?", "answer": "Probability papers for the normal and extreme-value distributions are the most frequently used in hydrology because these distributions are commonly encountered in hydrologic data and are well-established for representing a wide range of hydrologic variables.

{"paragraph": "5.2.8 Return Period The concept of return period was introduced in Chapter 4 with respect to rainfall. It is also used to describe the likelihood of flood magnitudes. As Equation 4-1 indicates, the return period is the reciprocal of the exceedence probability. Just as a 25-yr rainfall has a probabil- ity of 0.04 of occurring in any one year, a 25-yr flood has a probability of 0.04 of occurring in any one year. As indicated in Chapter 4, it is incorrect to believe that once a 25-yr event occurs it will not occur again for another 25 years. Two 25-yr events can occur in consecu- tive years. Then again, a period of 100 years may pass before a second 25-yr event occurs following the passage of a 25-yr event. Does the 25-yr rainfall cause the 25-yr flood magnitude? Some hydrologic models make this assumption; however, it is unlikely to be the case in actuality. It is a reasonable as- sumption for modeling because models are based on the average of expectation or \"on the average\" behavior. In actual occurrence of storms, the 25-yr flood magnitude will not occur if the 25-yr rainfall occurs on a dry watershed. Similarly, a 50-yr flood could occur from a 25-yr rainfall if the watershed was saturated. Modeling often assumes that a T-yr rainfall on a watershed that exists in a T-yr hydrologic condition will produce a T-yr flood. For some engineering problems, discharge rates are needed for short recurrence inter- vals, such as six or three months. These magnitudes cannot be treated in the same way as the 240 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 less frequent events, such as a 50-yr event.

{"paragraph": "5.3.1 The Normal Distribution Normal probability paper, which is commercially available, is commonly used in hydrology. Following the general procedure outlined above, the specific steps used to develop a curve for a normal population are as follows: 1. Assume that the random variable has a normal distribution with population parameters CL and a. 2. Compute the sample moments X and S (the skew is not needed). - 3. For the normal distribution, the parameters and sample moments are related by CL = X and a = S. 4. A curve is fitted as a straight line with (X - S) plotted at an exceedence probability of + 0.8413 and (X S) at an exceedence probability of 0.1587. The frequency curve of Figure 5-3 is an example for a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important to note that the curve passes through the two points: (y - S, 0.8413) and (57 + S, 0.1587). It also passes through the point defined by the (z + mean and a probability of 0.5. Two other points that could be used are 2S, 0.0228) and (X - 2S, 0.9772). Using the points farther removed from the mean has the advantage that in- accuracies in the line drawn to represent the population will be smaller than when using more interior points. In practice, the sample values should then be plotted (see Section 5.2.7) to decide whether or not the measured values closely approximate the population. If the data provide a reasonable fit to the line, one can assume that the underlying population is the normal distrib- ution and the sample mean and standard deviation are reasonable estimates of the location and scale parameters, respectively. A poor fit would indicate that either the normal distribu- tion is not the population or that the sample statistics are not good estimators of the popula- tion parameters, or both. When using a frequency curve, it is common to discuss the likelihood of events in terms of either the exceedency frequency, the exceedence probability, or a return period. The concept of exceedence frequency was discussed in Chapter 4 with respect to rainfall and in Section 5.1.3 with respect to runoff. The return period (T) is related to the exceedence proba- Sec. 5.3 Population Models 241 bility (p) by p = lIT, or T = lip. Thus an event with an exceedence probability of 0.01 should be expected to occur 1 time in 100. In many cases, a time unit is attached to the return period. For example, if the data represent annual floods at a location, the basic time unit is 1 yr. In such a case, the return period for an event with an exceedence probability of 0.01 would be the 100-yr event (that is, T = 110.01 = 100); similarly, the 25-yr event has an exceedence probability of 0.04 (that is, p = 1125 = 0.04). It is important to emphasize that two T-yr events will not necessarily occur exactly T-yr apart. Two T-yr events could occur in successive years; then again, two T-yr events may be spaced three times T-yr apart. But on the average the events will be spaced T-yr apart. Thus, in a long period of time, say 10,000-yr, we would expect 10,000lT such events to occur. In any one 10,000-yr period, we may have more or less occurrences than the mean number of occurrences (for example, 10,000lT). Estimation with a normal frequency curve. For the normal distribution, esti- mation may involve either finding a probability corresponding to a specified value of the ran- dom variable or finding the value of the random variable for a given probability. Both esti- mation problems can be made using either a graphical analysis or the mathematical models of Equations 5-2 and 5-3. In a graphical analysis, estimation involves simply either entering with the probability and finding the corresponding value of the random variable or entering with the value of the random variable and finding the corresponding exceedence probability. In both cases, the fit- ted line (that is, the population) is used. Example 5-1 Figure 5 4 s hows a frequency histogram for the data of Table 5-2. The sample consists of 58 an- nual maximum instantaneous discharges, with a mean of 8620 ft3/sec, a standard deviation of 4128 ft3/sec, and a standardized skew of 1.14. In spite of the large skew, the normal frequency curve was fitted using the procedure of the preceding section. Figure 5-5 shows the cumulative normal distribution using the sample mean and the standard deviation as estimates of the loca- X + tion and scale parameters. The population line was drawn by plotting S = 12,748 at X p = 15.87% and - S = 4492 at p = 84.13%, using the upper scale for the probabilities. The data were plotted using the Weibull plotting position formula (Equation 5-5a). It is evident that the data do not provide a reasonable fit to the population; the data show a significant skew with an especially poor fit to the tails of the distribution (that is, high and low exceedence probabilities). Because of the poor fit, the line shown in Figure 5-5 should not be used to make probability statements about the future occurrences of floods; for example, the normal distribution (that is, the line) would suggest a 1% chance flood magnitude of slightly more than 18,000 ft3/sec. How- ever, if a line was drawn subjectively through the trend of the points, the 1% chance flood would be considerably larger, say about 23,000 ft3/sec. The 100-yr flood is estimated by entering with a probability of 0.01 and finding the corre- sponding flood magnitude. We could also estimate probabilities. For example, if a levee system at this site would be overtopped at a magnitude of 16,000 ft3/sec, the curve indicates a corre- sponding probability of about 4%, which is the 25-yr flood. To estimate either probabilities or flood magnitudes using the mathematical model, Equa- tion 5-2 becomes X = % + zS because the frequency factor K of Equation 5-2 becomes the stan- dard normal deviate z for a normal distribution, where values of z are from Table 2-2. To find X the value of the random variable X, values for and S must be known and the value of z ob- tained from Table 2-2 for any probability.

For exam- ple, the value of z from Table 2-2 for a probability of 0.01 (that is, the 100-yr event) is 2.327; thus the flood magnitude for the case of Example 5-1 is which agrees with the value obtained from the graphical analysis.

{"paragraph": "5.3.2 The Log-Normal Distribution When a poor fit to observed data is obtained, a different distribution function should be considered. For example, when the data demonstrate a concave-upward curve, as in Figure 5-5, it is reasonable to try a log-normal distribution or an extreme-value distribution. In some cases, it may be preferable to fit with a distribution that requires an estimate of the skew coefficient, such as a log-Pearson Type I11 distribution. However, sample estimates of the skew coefficient may be inaccurate for small samples, and thus they should be used with caution. The same procedure that is used for fitting the normal distribution can be used to fit the log-normal distribution. The underlying population is assumed to be log normal. The data must first be transformed to logarithms, Y = log X. This transformation creates a new random variable Y. The mean and standard deviation of the logarithms are computed and used as the parameters of the population; it is important to recognize that the logarithm of the mean does not equal the mean of the logarithms, which is also true for the standard deviation. Thus one should not use the logarithms of the mean and standard deviation as parameters; the mean and standard deviation of the logarithms should be computed and used as the parameters. Ei- ther natural or base 10 logarithms may be used, although the latter is more common in hy- drology. The population line is defined by plotting the straight line on arithmetic probability paper between the points (Y + S,, 0.1587) and (7 - S,, 0.84 13), where 7 and S, are the mean and standard deviation of the logarithms, respectively. In plotting the data, either the loga- rithms can be plotted on an arithmetic scale or the untransformed data can be plotted on a logarithmic scale. Sec. 5.3 Population Models Exceedence Probability (%I FIGURE 55 Piscataquis River near Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. When using a frequency curve for a log-normal distribution, the value of the random (Y variable Y and the moments of the logarithms and S,) are related by the equation in which z is the value of the standardized normal variate; values of z and the corresponding probabilities can be taken from Table 2-2. Equation 5-6 can be used to estimate either flood magnitudes for a given exceedence probability or an exceedence probability for a specific discharge. To find a discharge for a specific exceedence probability the standard normal de- viate z is obtained from Table 2-2 and used in Equation 5-6 to compute the discharge. To find the exceedence probability for a given discharge Y, Equation 5-6 is rearranged by solv- ing for z. With values of Y, Y, a nd S,, a value of z is computed and used with Table 2-2 to compute the exceedence probability. Of course, the same values of both Y and the probability can be obtained directly from the frequency curve. Example 5-2 The peak discharge data for the Piscataquis River were transformed by taking the logarithm of Y each of the 58 values. The moments of the logarithms are as follows: = 3.8894, S, = 0.20308, and g = -0.07. A histogram of the logarithms is shown in Figure 5-6. In comparison to the his- togram of Figure 5 4 , the logarithms of the sample data are less skewed. While a skew of -0.07 would usually be rounded to -0.1, this is sufficiently close to 0 such that the discharges can be Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 3.30 3.60 3.90 4.20 4.50 Logarithm of Discharge FIGURE 5-6 Histogram of logarithms of annual maximum series: Piscataquis River. represented with a log-normal distribution. The frequency curve is shown in Figure 5-7. To plot 9- the log-normal population curve, the following two points were used: S, = 3.686 at p = 84.13% and Y + S, = 4.092 at p = 15.87%. The data points were plotted on Figure 5-7 using the Weibull formula and show a much closer agreement with the population line in comparison to the points for the normal distribution in Figure 5-5. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the measured peak discharge rates can be represented by a log-normal distribution and that the future flood behavior of the watershed can be described statistically using a log-normal distri- bution. If one were interested in the probability that a flood of 20,000 ft3/sec would be exceeded in any one year, the logarithm of 20,000, which is 4.301, would be entered on the discharge axis and followed to the assumed population line. Reading the exceedence probability corresponding to that point on the frequency curve, one concludes that there is about a 1.7% chance of a flood of 20,000 ft3/sec being exceeded in any one year. It can also be interpreted that over the span of 1000 years, one could expect the flood discharge to exceed 20,000 ft3/sec in 17 of those years; it is important to understand that this is an average value. In any period of 1000 years a value of 20,000 ft3/sec may be exceeded more or less than 17, but on the average there would be 17 ex- ceedences in a period of 1000 years. The probability of a discharge of 20,000 ft3/sec can also be estimated mathematically.

Since the excee- dence probability is of interest, this is subtracted from 1, which yields a value of 0.0214. This corresponds to a 47-yr flood. The difference between the mathematical estimate of 2.1 % and the graphical estimate of 1.7% is due to the error in the graph. The computed value of 2.1% should be used. The frequency curve can also be used to estimate flood magnitudes for selected probabili- ties. The flood magnitude is found by entering the figure with the exceedence probability, mov- ing vertically to the frequency curve, and finally moving horizontally to the flood magnitude. For example, the 100-yr flood for the Piscataquis River can be found by entering with an exceedence probability of 1%, moving to the curve of Figure 5-7 and then to the ordinate, which indicates a logarithm of about 4.3586 or a discharge of 22,800 ft3/sec. Discharges for other exceedence probabilities can be found in the same way or by using the mathematical model of Equation 5-2. In addition to the graphical estimate, Equation 5 4 c an be used to obtain a more exact es- timate. For an exceedence probability of 0.01, a z value of 2.327 is obtained from Table 2-2. Thus, the logarithm is Taking the anti-logarithm yields a discharge of 23013 ft3/sec. Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Example 5-3 The histogram of Figure 5-8a indicates that the sediment yield data of Table 5-3 are from a highly skewed probability density function. Figure 5-8b shows the histogram of the logarithms. The shape of the histogram suggests that the logarithms could be normally distributed. The data were subjected to a frequency analysis for a log-normal population. The mean, standard devia- tion, and standardized skew of the logarithms are -0.5506, 0.6154, and -0.0334, respectively. The data and logarithms in ranked order and Weibull plotting positions are given in Table 5-3, and the frequency curve is shown in Figure 5-9. As expected, the points follow the straight line for a log-normal population. Estimates of sediment yield or probabilities can be obtained graphically from Figure 5-9 or mathematically using Equations 5-2 and 5-3.

Therefore, the exceedence probability is 0.0832. The graphical estimate agrees with the computed probability. The magnitude corresponding to an exceedence probability of 2% is computed using a z of 2.054 (from Table 2-2): Therefore, the sediment yield is = 5.17. This is larger than any of the measured values. The histogram of Figure 5-8b indicates there were no large values in the upper tail of the sample distribution of the logarithms. Thus, the computed 50-yr value is beyond the upper ordinate of the measured frequencies, which would be expected given the small sample size.

For a record of n years, the data base would then consist of n intensities that are the highest intensity for a given duration during any storm event in the year. The n values would then be subjected to a frequency analysis. The data in Table 5-4 are the annual peak intensities for 2-hr duration storms in a 19-yr record. Past analyses have suggested that peak intensities can be represented with a log-normal distribution; thus each intensity was transformed using base 10 logarithms, with the resulting values given in Table 5-4. The rank and plotting probability are also given in Table 5-4. The Y mean and standard deviation of the logarithms were computed as = -0.081256 and S , = 0.14698, respectively. Thus the assumed model for the population is The data are plotted in Figure 5-10 and suggest that the log-normal distribution is a reasonable representation of the population. 252 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-4 Log-Normal Frequency Analysis of Annual Peak ZHour Rainfall Intensities Normal Return Plotting deviate Year i(in./hr) log i Rank Probability Period Position z Y x = 1OV The assumed model of Equation 5-7 was used to compute the 2-hr rainfall intensities for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years, which are also given in Table 5-4. The values can also be obtained by entering Figure 5-10 with the corresponding exceedence probability and finding the corresponding logarithm. For example, for the 100-yr intensity the graph is entered with an exceedence probability of 1% and the population line yields a logarithm of about 0.261, which agrees closely with the value obtained with Equation 5-7. The population line could also be used to find the probability of a specified intensity. For example, to find the probability of a rainfall depth of 5 in. in 2 hr, or an intensity of 2.5 in./hr, the logarithm of 2.5 is 0.3979.

{"paragraph": "5.3.3 The Log-Pearson Type Ill Distribution Normal and log-normal frequency analyses were introduced because they are easy to under- stand and have a variety of uses in hydrology. However, the statistical distribution most commonly used in hydrology in the United States of America is the log-Pearson Type I11 (LP3) distribution because it was recommended by the U.S. Water Resources Council in Bulletin 17B. The Pearson Type I11 distribution is a probability density function. It is widely accepted because it is easy to apply when the parameters are estimated using the method of moments and because it usually provides a good fit to measured data. An LP3 analysis re- quires a logarithmic transformation of the data; specifically, the common logarithms of the data are used as the variate, and the Pearson Type I11 distribution is used as the PDF. Thls re- sults in an LP3 analysis. Sec. 5.3 Population Models 253 Exceedence Probability (%I FIGURE 5-10 Log-normal frequency analysis of 2-hr rainfall intensity (4). While LP3 analyses have been made for most stream gage sites in the United States and can be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey, a brief description of the analysis pro- cedure will be given here. While the method of analysis presented here will follow the proce- dure recommended by the Water Resources Council in Bulletin 17B, when performing an analysis, Bulletin 17B should be consulted because a number of options and adjustments that are included in Bulletin 17B are not discussed here. The intent here is only to provide suffi- cient detail so that a basic frequency analysis can be made and properly interpreted. Bulletin 17B provides details for the analysis of three types of data: a systematic gage record, regional data, and historic information for the site. The systematic record consists of the annual maximum flood record. It is not necessary for the record to be a continuous record as long as the missing part of the record is not the result of flood experience, such as the de- struction of the stream gage during a large flood. Regional information includes a general- ized skew coefficient, a weighting procedure for handling independent estimates, and a means of correlating a short systematic record with a longer systematic record from a nearby stream gaging station. Historic evidence, such as high-water marks and newspaper accounts of flooding that occurred prior to the installation of the gage, can be used to augment infor- mation at the site. The procedure for fitting an LP3 curve with a measured systematic record is similar to the procedure used for the normal and log-normal analyses described previously. The Bul- 254 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 letin 17B procedure for analyzing a systematic record is based on a method-of-moments analysis and is as follows: 1. Create a series that consists of the logarithms Yio f the annual maximum flood series. 2. Using Equations 5-4 compute the sample mean, Y, s tandard deviation, S,, and stan- dardized skew, g,, of the logarithms of Step 1. 3. For selected values of the exceedence probability (p) obtain values of the standardized variate K from Appendix 5-1 (round the skew to the nearest tenth). 4. Determine the values of the LP3 curve for the exceedence probabilities selected in Step 3 using the equation in which Y is the logarithmic value of the LP3 curve. Y, 5. Take the antilogarithm of the values and use them to plot the LP3 frequency curve. Having determined the LP3 population curve, the data can be plotted to determine the adequacy of the curve. Confidence limits can also be placed on the curve; the procedure for computing confidence intervals is discussed in Bulletin 17B. In Step 3 it is necessary to select two or more points to compute and plot the LP3 curve. If the absolute value of the skew is small, the line will be nearly straight and only a few points are necessary to draw the line accurately. When the absolute value of the skew is large, more points must be used because of the greater curvature of the LP3 curve. When se- lecting exceedence probabilities, it is common to include 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.002 because these correspond to return periods that are usually of interest. Example 5-5 Data for the Back Creek near Jones Springs, West Virginia (USGS gaging station 01-6140), is given in Table 5-5. Based on the 38 years of record (1929-1931, 1939-1973), the mean, stan- dard deviation, and skew of the common logarithms are 3.722,0.2804, and -0.731, respectively; the skew will be rounded to -0.7. Table 5-6 shows the K values of Equation 5-8 for selected values of the exceedence probability (p); these values were obtained from Appendix 5-1 using y and the sample skew of -0.7. Equation 5-8 was used to compute the logarithms of the LP3 dis- charges for the selected exceedence probabilities (Table 5-6). The logarithms of the discharges were then plotted versus the exceedence probabilities, as shown in Figure 5-1 1. The rank of each event is also shown in Table 5-5 and was used to compute the exceedence probability using the Weibull plotting position formula (Equation 5-5a). The loga- rithms of the measured data were plotted versus the exceedence probability (Figure 5-1 1). The data show a reasonable fit to the frequency curve, although the fit is not especially good for the few highest and the lowest measured discharges; the points with exceedence probabilities between 80 and 92% suggest a poor fit. Given that we can only make subjective assessments of the good- ness of fit, the computed frequency curve appears to be a reasonable estimate of the population. The curve of Figure 5-1 1 could be used to estimate either flood discharges for selected exceedence probabilities or exceedence probabilities for selected discharges. For example, the 100-yr flood (p = 0.01) equals 16,992 ft3/sec (that is, log Q = 4.2285 from Table 5-6). The ex- ceedence probability for a discharge of 10,000 ft3/sec (that is, log Q = 4) is approximately 0.155 from Figure 5-1 1; this would correspond to the 6-yr event.

{"paragraph": "5.3.4 Low-Flow Frequency Analysis Partially-treated wastewater is commonly discharged into streams and rivers where it mixes with the existing flow. Natural processes improve the overall quality of the total flow. Dur- ing periods of low flow the volume of wastewater may be too large to be safely discharged without reducing the quality of the water below established water-quality standards. When evaluating sites for suitability for a manufacturing or commercial business, it is important to Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-6 Computation of Log Pearson Type 111 Frequency Curve for Back Creek Near Jones Springs, West Virginia Exceedence Probability (%) FIGURE 5-11 Log Pearson Type 111 frequency curve for Back Creek near Jones Spring, WV, with station skew (-) and weighted skew (- 1. Sec. 5.3 Population Models 257 assess the probability that the stream will almost always have sufficient flow to meet the need for discharging wastewater. Such probabilities are estimated using a low-flow fre- quency analysis at the site. While instantaneous maximum discharges are used for flood frequency analyses, low- flow frequency analyses usually specify a flow duration (for example, 7-day). The instanta- neous discharge is used with high flows because damage often occurs even if the site is inun- dated only for a very short period of time. This may not be true for low flows because high pollution concentrations over very short periods of time may not be damaging to the aquatic life of the stream. Thus, the duration, such as seven days or one month, is specified in estab- lishing the policy. One difference between low-flow and flood frequency analyses is that the data for low- flow analyses consist of the annual events that have the lowest average flow of the required duration D during each water year of record. Thus, the records of flow for each water year are evaluated to find the period of D days during which the average flow was the lowest; these annual values are used as the sample data. The record of n years is then evaluated using frequency analysis. The. log-normal distribution is commonly selected for low-flow fre- quency analyses, however an LP3 analysis could be used. Once the data record has been collected, the procedure for making a low-flow fre- quency analysis is quite similar to that used for flood frequency analysis. The major differ- ences are listed here: 1. Instead of using the exceedence probability scale, the nonexceedence scale (that is, the scale at the bottom of the probability paper) is used to obtain probabilities. The nonex- ceedence scale is important because the T-yr event is the value that will not be ex- ceeded. 2. The data are ranked from low to high, with the smallest sample magnitude associated with a Weibull probability of ll(n+l) and the largest magnitude associated with a probability of nl(n+l); any other plotting position formula could be used in place of the Weibull. However, plotting position probabilities are nonexceedence proba- bilities. 3. The mathematical model for predicting magnitudes remains but since nonexceedence is of interest, the T-yr values are from the lower tail of the distribution; thus, values obtained from a normal distribution table should be from the lower tail (that is, negative values of z). In obtaining estimates from either the graph or Equation 5-9, the low magnitudes are the extreme events. Example 5 4 Table 5-7 includes the 7-day, low-flow series for a 19-yr record. The data were subjected to a log-normal, low-flow frequency analysis, with a mean and standard deviation of the logarithms -eq ual to 1.4028 and 0.1181, respectively. The population curve is plotted using two points: Y - S, = 1.2847 plotted at a nonexceedence probability of 0.1587 and 7 + S, = 1.5209 plotted at Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-7 Data for Example 5-6 Plotting Discharge Rank Probability (ft* *3ls) Logarithm a nonexceedence probability of 0.8413. The data are also plotted in Figure 5-12, with the Weibull equation used to compute the plotting position probabilities. The population curve agrees with the measured data, which suggests that the log-normal distribution is a good repre- sentation of the population. Estimates of 7-day low flows can be obtained from the frequency plot of Figure 5-12 or from the mathematical model in which z is the standard normal deviate. The following gives the estimated 7-day low flow (Q,) for selected exceedence frequencies (T): It is evident that, on the average, once every 50 years, the lowest 7-day average flow will fall to 14.5 ft3/sec.

{"paragraph": "5.4.2 Weighted Skew The skew is the moment most sensitive to sampling variation, especially for small samples, which are common in hydrology. Recognizing this, the Bulletin 17B recommends using a weighted skew coefficient rather than the sample skew.

The generalized skew is a regional estimate of the skew; it is based on regional trends in the skew coefficients from nearby gaging stations. Bulletin 17B includes a map of the generalized skew for the United States, as well as a general procedure for deriving estimates of general- ized skew. For small samples the weighting should significantly improve the accuracy of the skew. The two parts of the process will be introduced separately. Estimating generalized skew. Generalized skew is a skew value obtained through regionalization, that is, from pooling information about skew from all sites within a homogeneous region. Three methods can be used: (1) the construction of skew isolines on a map of a region, where the isolines are based on the station (sample) skew values for all sites in the region; (2) the development of prediction equations for estimating the skew using wa- tershed characteristics as predictor variables; and (3) the mean of the skew coefficients (g) for all stations in the region. Although these methods have been studied, their success has been limited. Isoline maps of the standardized skew of Equation 5 4 c can be constructed by plotting the station values of g for all gages in the region and drawing lines of equal skew, or isolines. Geographic and topographic trends should be considered in mapping the isolines. The value from the resulting map for the point of interest is referred to as the generalized skew and is g. denoted by The mean square error (MSE) should be computed and used to assess the accu racy of the isoline map. The accuracy of the map is significant only if the MSE of the map is less than the MSE of the mean skew for the stations used to construct the map. The MSE of the map is considered to be the accuracy of generalized skew estimates. The map of Figure 5-14 is a generalized skew map for the United States; the map is from the Bulletin No. 17B. This map can be used where data for a more complete map are not available. The MSE for the map of Figure 5-14 is 0.302. As an alternative to mapping the skew coefficient, a prediction equation can be devel- oped using the skew as the criterion variable and watershed and meteorologic characteristics as predictor variables. The MSE of the regression equation can be used as a measure of the accuracy of the equation. Like the isoline map, this procedure has not had much success. It appears that our lack of understanding of the factors that cause the skew coefficient to vary has limited the success of both the mapping and the prediction equation approaches. While Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 263 FIGURE 5-14 Generalized skew coefficients of annual maximum streamflow logarithms. (Bul- letin 17B, 1982.) watershed storage is probably the hydrologic reason for variation in skew, most watershed characteristics do not directly reflect storage. As an alternative to the mapping and prediction-equation approaches, the mean of sta- tion skews in the region can be computed and used as the generalized estimate of skew. The MSE of the mean skew should be compared with the mean square errors of the isoline map and the prediction equation. The estimate with the smallest MSE should be used as the esti- mate of generalized skew. Weighting of station and generalized skew. Given estimates of station skew g, g and a generalized skew a weighted skew coefficient can be computed using the follow- ing equation: in which MSE? and MSE, are the mean square errors for generalized skew and station skew, respectively. Equation 5-1 1 provides an estimate with the minimum mean square error, as- suming that the generalized skew is unbiased and independent of station skew.

{"paragraph": "5.4.3 Confidence Intervals on a Frequency Curve A frequency curve developed from sample data is the best estimate of the population curve. If we knew the data that would occur over the next two decades or any such short period, a different frequency record would result; thus we would have a different estimate of the T-yr event. If we could collect data for many time periods of n years, we would have an array of frequency curves and thus an array of estimates of the T-yr event. The variation of these T-yr events represents sampling error, or the variation that can be expected from taking a sample from a population. If we were to use this distribution to hypothesize about the true value, we could select a level of confidence about our statement and determine limits between which we would expect the true value to lie with y percent confidence. The interval between these limits is termed a confidence interval. The sample flood frequency curve represents some average estimate of the true popu- lation curve. When the flood estimate obtained from a frequency curve is used for design, we recognize that there is a high probability, possibly 50%, that the true value actually lies above the sample estimate of the T-yr event. This implies that there is a good likelihood that locations will be flooded by a T-yr event even when the design is based on the T-yr estimate obtained from a flood frequency analysis. Due to the possibility for flooding in areas where public facilities have been designed to provide flood protection at a T-yr level of protection, public agencies may wish to reduce the average flooding due to the T-yr event to some per- centage well below that provided by the T-yr frequency curve estimate. This is one possible motivation for computing and using a confidence interval on the frequency curve estimate. Either one-sided or two-sided confidence intervals can be developed. A two-sided con- fidence interval provides both an upper and lower limit. For one-sided confidence intervals, either a lower or an upper limit, but not both, can be constructed. The type of problem will determine which form is used. Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 265 Factors affecting a confidence interval. The width of a confidence interval is affected by a number of factors. First is the degree of confidence, which is indicated by the confidence coefficient, y, that one wishes to have in the decision. While a 95% confidence coefficient is commonly used, 75%, 9096, and 99% are also used. The larger the level of con- fidence, the greater the confidence one has in a decision; thus the width of the interval also increases as y increases. Second, the sample size used to compute the frequency curve affects the width of the confidence interval. A larger sample suggests greater accuracy in the statistics used to define the curve, so the width of the confidence interval decreases as the sample size increases. Third, the exceedence probability for which the confidence interval is needed affects the width of the interval. The interval will be smallest for the mean flood, whch is the 2-yr event, or the event with an exceedence probability of 0.5. Other factors (for example, n, y) being the same, the width of the confidence interval will increase as the exceedence fre- quency deviates from a value of 0.5. The width of the confidence interval is also affected by the skew coefficient. As is evi- dent from the standard errors of Section 5.4.1, the skew affects the standard error, with the width of the interval increasing as the absolute value of the skew increases. This reflects the greater error in the computed value of a standard deviation or skew coefficient as the magni- tude of the skew increases. This must be reflected in the width of the confidence interval computed for a frequency curve based on sample statistics. Bulletin 17B procedure for confidence intervals. Bulletin 17B provides an approximate solution for developing confidence intervals on a frequency curve. The general forms of the upper and lower bounds on the y percent confidence interval are Y + Y, = KuSy (5- 12 a) YL= Y - KLSy (5-12b) Y in which and S, are the mean and standard deviation of the logarithms, respectively; Ku and KL are the upper and lower distribution factors; and Y, and Y, are the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval. If a one-sided interval is computed, only one of the limits is computed. The distribution factors are computed by in which 266 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 in which K is the frequency factor of Appendix 5-1, n is the sample size, and z is the confi- dence limit deviate values for a normal distribution from Table 2-2. In summary, the following inputs are required to compute confidence intervals: the level of confidence, the return period or exceedence probability, the sample moments (Y, S , g ) for the logarithms of the flood series, and the sample size. The data for the Back Creek watershed can be used to illustrate the computation of confidence intervals for frequency curves. The 95% level of confidence is selected because of convention, and a one-sided upper limit will be computed. The upper limit will be computed for return peri- ods of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years since these return periods are commonly used in hydro- logic design. The sample mean and standard deviation of the common logarithms were given as 3.722 and 0.2804, respectively. The weighted skew was computed in Equation 5-1 1 as -0.2. The sample size was 38. The calculations for the 100-yr event will be shown here, with the results for the other re- turn periods given in Table 5-9. To apply Equations 5-12 to 5-14, the standard normal deviate for a 95% limit is required; from Table 2-2 z equals 1.645. From Appendix 5-1 the frequency factor for T = 100 yrs and g = -0.2 is 2.17840; therefore, Equations 5-14 yield Since only an upper limit is needed, Equation 5-13a can be used to compute the distribution factor: Equation 5-12a is used to compute the upper confidence limit: Taking the antilog yields an upper limit of 31,567 ft3/sec, which can be compared with the 100-yr flood estimate of i + = 3.722 0.2804(2.17840) = 4.33282 TABLE 5-9 Computation of 95% Upper Confidence Limits for Back Creek Watershed Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 267 which has an antilog of 21,519 ft3/sec. The values of Table 5-9 indicate that the difference be- tween the upper limit and the frequency curve increases as the return period increases, which re- flects the decrease in accuracy of the sample statistics and therefore the frequency curve. The confidence limit on the frequency curve defines a one-sided interval, and we can con- clude that we are 95% certain that true T-yr flood is less than the confidence limit. Both the points that describe the frequency curve and the confidence limits could be plotted on probabil- ity paper, with intermediate points then available by interpolation. For example, if either the 20-yr or 75-yr event at the gaged location were of interest, their values could be obtained from the plotted frequency line. However, it is important to emphasize that the resulting upper confi- dence interval defines an upper limit on the T-yr event and not an interval on the entire fre- quency curve. That is, confidence intervals computed using the procedure of Equations 5-12 to 5-14 is a method of estimating the confidence limit on the mean T-yr event.

By acknowledging the uncertainty in the estimated T-yr event, designers can make more informed decisions, potentially opting to design for a higher level of protection than that indicated by the point estimate of the T-yr event alone, thereby reducing the likelihood of flooding."}, {"question": "How does the computation of confidence intervals for different return periods reflect the accuracy of sample statistics?", "answer": "The computation of confidence intervals for different return periods reflects the accuracy of sample statistics in that the difference between the upper limit and the frequency curve estimate increases as the return period increases. This increase indicates a decrease in the accuracy of the sample statistics for estimating less frequent flood events, highlighting the challenge of predicting rare events with precision."}, {"question": "In what manner can the confidence limit on the frequency curve be interpreted, and what does it signify?", "answer": "The confidence limit on the frequency curve can be interpreted as defining an upper limit on the T-yr event rather than an interval on the entire frequency curve.

{"paragraph": "5.4.4 Adjusting for Historic Floods In addition to a systematic record of N years, historic flood information, such as high-water marks, is sometimes available at or near the gaging station. When such information can be used to provide a reliable estimate of a flood magnitude, the computed value can be used to adjust the frequency curve based on the systematic record. Procedure. Bulletin 17B provides the following procedure for adjusting a fre- quency curve for historic information: 1. Obtain data. (a) Identify the N annual maximum flows in the systematic record. (b) Identify the L low values to be excluded; this includes the number of zero flows or flows below a measurable base and the number of low outliers (outliers are dis- cussed in Section 5.4.5). (c) Identify the length of time (H years) over which the historic flood information is known to represent (note: the historic period includes the length of the systematic record). (d) Identify the number (2) of historic peaks (including high outliers); the hlstoric peaks and high outliers must be larger than the peaks in the systematic record. 2. Compute weights. (a) Assign a weight of 1 to each of the Z historic events in the historic period H and to any high outliers. (b) Compute a weight W to assign to each of the N events in the systematic record: H - Z W = N + L (Note: If high outliers are removed from the systematic record for treatment as his- toric peaks, the value of N should be adjusted accordingly.) 3.

Example 5-10 The flood record in Bulletin 17B from the Big Sandy River at Bruceton, TN, will be used to il- lustrate the steps for the historical adjustment. The record consists of a systematic record of 44 years (1930-1973), 3 historic events (1897, 1919, 1927) and a historic period of 77 years (1897-1973).

The generalized skew of -0.2 is obtained from the Bulletin 17B map (see Figure 5-14), which has a mean square error, MSE,, of 0.302.

By incorporating historic information into the computation of moments, the adjusted frequency curve can better capture the variability and distribution of flood magnitudes, leading to more accurate predictions and a more reliable representation of flood risk."}, {"question": "In the context of the example provided, how does the use of generalized skew from the Bulletin 17B map impact the computation of the historically weighted skew?", "answer": "The use of generalized skew from the Bulletin 17B map provides a mean square error of 0.302, which is then used to compute the historically weighted skew.

By using the historically adjusted order number and plotting position, the plot provides a graphical representation of how well the adjusted frequency curve captures the characteristics of the flood data. The close fit of the data, as shown in the example, indicates that the assumed population is a reasonable estimate of the population, validating the adjusted frequency curve and providing confidence in its use for predicting flood frequencies and magnitudes."}, {"question": "How does the adjustment procedure for historic floods account for the potential impact of high outliers on the frequency curve?", "answer": "The adjustment procedure accounts for high outliers by treating them as historic peaks and assigning them a weight of 1, similar to other historic events. This ensures that high outliers are properly integrated into the computation of the frequency curve, preventing them from disproportionately influencing the curve and providing a more accurate representation of flood risk."}, {"question": "In the context of the adjustment procedure, what is the role of the historic period, and how does it relate to the systematic record and historic flood information?", "answer": "The historic period represents the length of time over which the historic flood information is known to represent, including the length of the systematic record.

{"paragraph": "5.4.5 Outliers When the procedures of Sections 5.2 and 5.3 are used to compute a frequency curve and plot the data, it is not uncommon for the data points to depart from the trend of the line in the tails of the distribution. Those points that do not appear to follow the trend of the data are consid- ered to be extreme events. Figure 5-16 provides an example of a frequency plot that shows a 25-yr record on the Republican River near Hardy, Nebraska. The largest flood in the 25-yr period of record before the 1935 event (1910-1934) is 38,000 ft3/sec. In 1935, a flood of 225,000 ft3/sec occurred. For the Hazen plotting position formula, such an event would plot with an exceedence probability of 1/52 or 0.019, which would obviously place the flood high above the trend of the other 25 flood magnitudes. If such an extreme event is included in the standard analysis, the data points will not follow the trend of the assumed population regard- less of the probability distribution. Several options are available: (I) use the standard analy- sis regardless of the apparent disparity; (2) make a standard analysis after censoring (that is, deleting) the extreme event from the record; and (3) adjust the plotting position of the ex- treme event.

An extreme event can be tested to determine whether or not it can be declared to be an outlier. A systematic test is needed. If the test shows that the extreme event is unlikely to be from the same population as the remainder of the data, then it can be called an outlier and handled appropriately. Outliers can occur in either, or both, the upper and lower tails, which are referred to as high and low outliers, respectively. Bulletin 17B detection procedure.

The flowchart of Figure 5-17 shows the procedure for treating outliers recommended in Bulletin 17B. If the station skew is greater Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve (7 BEGIN Frequency Curve FIGURE 5-17 Flow diagram for historic and outlier adjustment. 276 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 than 0.4, extreme events that may be high outliers are tested first. If the station skew is less than -0.4, extreme events that may be low outliers are tested first. If the station skew is be- tween -0.4 and 0.4, then tests should be made for both the high and low outliers before elim- inating any outliers from the flood series. The rationale behind the 0.4 limit for high outliers and -0.4 for low outliers is as fol- lows. High outliers, such as the 1935 magnitude in Figure 5-16, will cause a significant in- crease in the computed value of the station skew. Similarly, a very low flood magnitude will cause a more negatively skewed sample. Since the average skew for the United States is ap- proximately 0, then a reasonable likelihood exists that computed skews above 0.4 are due to the presence of a high outlier and that computed skews more negative than -0.4 are due to the presence of a low outlier. If both a high outlier and a low outlier exist within a flood record, then the skew may be near zero because of the offsetting effects on the summation in Equation 54c; thus, they should be tested simultaneously before censoring or making an ad- justment. If a high outlier is detected, then it is necessary to have historic flood data or flood in- formation at nearby sites in order to make an adjustment. A flood shown to be a high outlier can be treated as a historic flood using the procedure of Section 5.4.4. If the other flood in- formation is not available, then the event should be retained with the remainder of the sys- tematic flood record. If a low outlier is detected, then the value is censored and the conditional probability adjustment is applied. For this adjustment, the adjustment probability pa is computed: in which N is the number of events after outliers have been censored and n is the systematic record length. The conditional exceedence probabilities p, are computed using the plotting probabilities from one of the formulas of Equation 5-5: in which pi is p,, p,,, or p, from Equations 5-5.

{"paragraph": "5.4.6 Adjusting a Flood Record for Urbanization A statistical flood frequency analysis is based on the assumption of a homogeneous annual flood record. Significant changes in land use is a source of nonhomogeneity of flood charac- teristics, thus violating the assumptions that underline frequency analysis. A flood frequency analysis based on a nonhomogeneous record will result in inaccurate estimates of flood esti- mates for any return period. Therefore, the affect of nonhomogeneity must be estimated prior to making a frequency analysis so that the flood record can be adjusted. Urbanization is a primary cause of nonhomogeneity of flood records. Although this problem has been recognized for decades, there have been few attempts at developing a sys- tematic procedure for malung the necessary adjustment of flood records. Multiparameter wa- tershed models have been used for this purpose; however, a single model or procedure for Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 277 adjustment has not been widely accepted by the professional community. Comparisons of methods for adjusting records have not been made. The affect of urbanization. A number of models that enable the effect of urban- ization on peak discharges to be assessed are available. Some models provide a basis for ac- counting for urbanization, but it is difficult to develop a general statement of the affect of ur- banization from these models. For example, with the Rational method, urban development would have an affect on both the runoff coefficient and the time of concentration. Thus it is not possible to make a general statement that a 5% increase in imperviousness will cause an x% increase in the peak discharge for a specific return period. Other models are not so con- strained. A number of regression equations are available that include the percentage of impervi- ousness as a predictor variable. With such models it is possible to develop a general state- ment on the effect of urbanization. Sarma et al. (1969) provided one such example: in which A is the drainage area (mi2), U is the fraction of imperviousness, PE is the volume of excess rainfall (in.), TR is the duration of rainfall excess (hours), and qp the peak discharge (ft3/sec). Since the model has the power-model form, the specific effect of urbanization de- pends on the values of the other predictor variables (that is, A, PE, and TR).H owever, the rel- ative sensitivity of Equation 5-27 can be used as a measure of the effect of urbanization. The relative sensitivity (S,) is given by Evaluation of Equation 5-28 yields a relative sensitivity of 1.516. Thus a 1% change in U will cause a change of 1.516% in the peak discharge. This estimate is an average effect since it is independent of both the value of U and the return period. Based on the work of Carter (1961) and Anderson (1970), Dunne and Leopold (1978) provided the following equation for estimating the effect of urbanization: in which f is a factor that gives the relative increase in peak discharge for a percent impervi- ousness of U. The following is a summary of the effect of urbanization based on the model of Equation 5-29: Thus a 1% increase in U will increase the peak discharge by 1.5%, which is the same effect shown by the model of Equation 5-28. The SCS provided an adjustment for urbanization for the TR-55 (1975) chart method. The adjustment depended on the percentages of imperviousness and the hydraulic length modified (see Figure 5-18), as well as the runoff curve number (CN). Although the adjust- ment does not specifically include the return period as a factor, the chart method incorporates Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Peak Factor (a) Peak Factor (b) FIGURE 5-18 Factors for adjusting peak discharges for a given future-condition runoff curve number based on (a) the percentage of impervious area in the water- shed and (b) the percentage of the hydraulic length modified. the return period through the rainfall input. Table 5-12 provides the adjustment factors for imperviousness and the hydraulic length modified. Assuming that these changes occur in the same direct proportion, the effect of urbanization on peak discharges would be the square of the factor. Approximate measures of the effect of changes in f, from change in U are also shown in Table 5-12 (R,); these values of R, represent the change in peak discharge due to the peak factors provided in TR-55 (1975). Additional effects of urban development on the peak discharge would be reflected in change in the CN. However, the relative sensitivities of the SCS chart method suggest a change in peak discharge of 1.3 to 2.6% for a 1% change in urbanization, which represents the combined effect of changes in imperviousness and modi- fications of the hydraulic length. The USGS urban peak discharge equations provide another alternative for assessing the effects of urbanization. The equations are given in Table 7-5. Figures 5-19 and 5-20 Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 279 TABLE 5-12 Adjustment Factors for Urbanization SCS Chart Method USGS Urban Equations CN U f f Rs T u fi Rs show the ratio of the urban to rural discharge as a function of the percentage of impervious- ness and a basin development factor. For the 2-yr event, the ratio ranges from 1 to 4.5, with the latter value for complete development. For the 100-yr event the ratio has a maximum value of 2.7. For purposes of illustration and assuming that basin development occurs in di- rect proportion to changes in imperviousness, the values of Table 5-12 (Rs)s how the effect of urbanization on peak discharge. The average change in peak discharge due to a 1% change in urbanization is 1.75 and 0.9% for the 2- and 100-yr events, respectively. While the meth- ods discussed previously provided an effect of about 1.5%, the USGS equations suggest that Bulk of data within 0 50 100 Impervious Area, IA (%) FIGURE 5-19 Ratio of the urban to rural 2-year peak discharge as a function of basin development factor (BDF) and impervious area (IA).

Rantz (1971) provided a method for assessing the effect of urbanization on peak dis- charges using simulated data of James (1965) for the San Francisco Bay area. Urbanization is characterized by two variables: the percentages of channels sewered and basin developed. The percentage of basin developed is approximately twice the percentage of impervious- ness. The peak factors are shown in Figure 5-21. The data of Table 5-13 show the relative sensitivity of the peak discharge to (a) the percent imperviousness, and (b) the combined ef- fect of two variables: the percentages of channels sewered and basin developed. For urban- ization as measured by the percentage change in imperviousness, the mean relative sensitiv- ities are 2.6%, 1.7%, and 1.2% for the 2-, lo-, and 100-yr events, respectively. These values are larger by about 30 to 50% than the values computed from the USGS urban equations. When both the percentages of channels sewered and basin developed are used as indices of development, the relative sensitivities are considerably higher. The mean relative sensitivi- ties are 7. I, 5.1, and 3.5% for the 2-, lo-, and 100-yr events, respectively. These values are much larger than the values suggested by the other methods discussed in the preceding paragraphs. A method for adjusting a flood record. The literature does not identify a single method that is considered to be the best method for adjusting a flood record. Each method depends on the data used to calibrate the prediction process, and the data base used to cali- brate the methods are very sparse. However, the sensitivities suggest that a 1% increase in imperviousness causes an increase in peak discharge of about 1 to 2.5% with the former Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve PERCENTAGE OF CHANNELS SEWERED FIGURE 5-21 Ratio of post-development to pre-development peak discharge rates as a function of the percentages of basin developed and channels sewered for recur- rence intervals of: (a) 2-yr; (b) 5-yr; (c) 10-yr; (d) 25-yr; (e) 50-yr; and (f) 100-yr. 282 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-13 Effect on Peak Discharge of (a) the Percentage of Imperviousness (U) and (b) the Combined Effect of Urban Development (D) value for the 100-yr event and the latter for the 2-yr event. However, there was considerable variation at any return period. Based on the general trends of the data, a method of adjusting a flood record was devel- oped. Figure 5-22 shows the peak adjustment factor as a function of the exceedence probabil- ity for percentages of imperviousness up to 60%. The greatest effect is for the more frequent events and the highest percentage of imperviousness. Given the return period of a flood peak for a nonurbanized watershed, the effect of an increase in imperviousness can be assessed by multiplying the discharge by the peak adjustment factor for the return period and percentage of imperviousness. Where it is necessary to adjust a discharge from a partially urbanized wa- tershed to a discharge for another watershed condition, the discharge can be divided by the peak adjustment factor for the existing condition and then the resulting \"rural\" discharge mul- tiplied by the peak adjustment factor for the second watershed condition. The first operation (that is, division) adjusts the discharge to a magnitude representative of a nonurbanized con- dition. The adjustment method of Figure 5-22 requires an exceedence probability. For a flood record, the best estimate of the probability is obtained from a plotting position formula. The following procedure can be used to adjust a flood record for which the individual flood events have occurred on a watershed that is undergoing a continuous change in the level of urbanization: 1. Identify both the percentage of imperviousness for each event in the flood record and the percentage of imperviousness for which an adjusted flood record is needed. 2. Compute the rank (i) and exceedence probability 07) for each event in the flood record (a plotting position formula can be used to compute the probability). 3. Using the exceedence probability and the actual percentage of imperviousness, find from Figure 5-22 the peak adjustment factor (f,) to transform the measured peak from the actual level of imperviousness to a nonurbanized condition. Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve FIGURE 5-22 Peak adjustment factors for urbanizing watersheds. 4. Using the exceedence probability and the percentage of imperviousness for which a 6) flood series is needed, find from Figure 5-22 the peak adjustment factor that is necessary to transform the nonurbanized peak to a discharge for the desired level of imperviousness. 5. Compute the adjusted discharge (Q,) by in which Q is the measured discharge. 6. Repeat Steps 3,4, and 5 for each event in the flood record and rank the adjusted series. 7. If there are significant changes in the ranks of the measured (Q) and adjusted (Q,) flood series, repeat Steps 2 through 6 until the ranks do not change. It is important to note that this procedure should be applied to the flood peaks and not to the logarithms of the flood peaks. This is true even when the adjusted series will be used to com- pute a log-normal or log-Pearson Type I11 frequency curve. The peak adjustment factors of Figure 5-22 are based on methods that show the effect of imperviousness on flood peaks, not on the logarithms. The following example illustrates the application of the method. 284 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Example 5-11 Table 5-14 contains the 48-yr record of annual maximum peak discharges for the Rubio Wash watershed in Los Angeles. Between 1929 and 1964 the percent of impervious cover, which is also given in Table 5-17, increased from 18 to 40%. The mean and standard deviation of the logarithms of the record are 3.2517 and 0.1910, respectively. The station skew was -0.53. and the map skew was -0.45. Therefore, a weighted skew of -0.5 was used. The procedure was used to adjust the flood record from actual levels of imperviousness for the period from 1929 to 1963 to current impervious cover conditions. For example, while the peak discharges for 1931 and 1945 occurred when the percent cover was 19 and 34%, respec- tively, the values were adjusted to a common percentage of 40%, which is the watershed state after 1964. Three iterations of adjustments were required. The iterative process is required be- cause the return period for some of the earlier events changed considerably from the measured record; for example, the rank of the 1930 peak changed from 30 to 22 on the first trial, and the rank of the 1933 event went from 20 to 14. Because of such changes in the rank, the exceedence probabilities change and thus the adjustment factors, which depend on the exceedence probabili- ties, change. After the second adjustment is made, the rank of the events did not change, so the process is complete. The adjusted series is given in the last part of Table 5-14. The adjusted series has a mean and standard deviation of 3.2800 and 0.1785, respectively. As expected, the mean increased and the standard deviation decreased. The mean increased be- cause the earlier events occurred when less impervious cover existed. The standard deviation de- creased because the measured data include both natural variation and variation due to different levels of imperviousness. The adjustment corrected for the latter source of variation. The ad- justed flood frequency curve will, in general, be higher than the curve for the measured series but will have a smaller slope. The higher curve reflects the effect of the higher amount of imper- viousness (40%). The lower slope reflects the fact that the adjusted series is for a single level of imperviousness. The computations for the adjusted and unadjusted flood frequency curves are given in Table 5-15. The percent increase in the 2-, 5-, lo-, 15, 50-, and 100-yr flood magni- tudes are also given in Table 5-15. The change is relatively minor because the imperviousness did not change after 1964 and the change was only minor (that is, 10%) from 1942 to 1964; also most of the larger storm events occurred after the watershed had reached the developed condi- tion. The adjusted series would represent the annual flood series for a constant urbanization con- dition (for example, 40% imperviousness). Of course, the adjusted series is not a measured se- ries, and its accuracy depends on the representativeness of Figure 5-22 for measuring the effects of urbanization.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, what assumption is violated when there are significant changes in land use?", "answer": "The assumption of a homogeneous annual flood record is violated when there are significant changes in land use, such as urbanization, which can alter flood characteristics."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to adjust a flood record for urbanization prior to making a frequency analysis?", "answer": "Adjusting a flood record for urbanization is necessary because urbanization can cause nonhomogeneity in flood characteristics, leading to inaccurate estimates of flood estimates for any return period if left unadjusted.

(1969)?", "answer": "The relative sensitivity of peak discharge to changes in imperviousness, according to the model of Sarma et al. (1969), is 1.516, meaning that a 1% change in imperviousness will cause a 1.516% change in peak discharge. This value represents an average effect, independent of both the value of imperviousness and the return period, providing a basis for understanding how urbanization affects flood peaks."}, {"question": "Why do different methods for adjusting flood records for urbanization yield varying estimates of the effect of urbanization on peak discharges?", "answer": "Different methods for adjusting flood records for urbanization yield varying estimates of the effect of urbanization on peak discharges because each method depends on the data used to calibrate the prediction process, and the data bases used to calibrate these methods are very sparse. This variability underscores the challenge of developing a universally applicable adjustment method, as the impact of urbanization can vary significantly depending on local conditions and the specific characteristics of the watershed."}, {"question": "How does the USGS urban peak discharge equations provide an alternative for assessing the effects of urbanization on flood records?", "answer": "The USGS urban peak discharge equations provide an alternative for assessing the effects of urbanization on flood records by offering a method to estimate the ratio of urban to rural discharge as a function of the percentage of imperviousness and a basin development factor.

It is applied by first identifying the percentage of imperviousness for each event in the flood record and the desired percentage of imperviousness, then using the exceedence probability and the actual and desired percentages of imperviousness to find the appropriate peak adjustment factors from a graph like Figure 5-22. The adjusted discharge is then computed by multiplying the measured discharge by the ratio of the peak adjustment factors for the desired and actual conditions."}, {"question": "Why is it important to apply the adjustment procedure to the flood peaks rather than to the logarithms of the flood peaks?", "answer": "It is important to apply the adjustment procedure to the flood peaks rather than to the logarithms of the flood peaks because the peak adjustment factors are based on methods that show the effect of imperviousness on flood peaks, not on the logarithms of flood peaks.

{"paragraph": "5.4.7 Testing the Significance of Urbanization A basic assumption of frequency analysis is that each of the values in the record were sam- pled from the same population. In hydrologic terms, this assumption implies that the water- shed has not undergone a systematic change. Obviously, the state of a watershed is continu- ally changing. Seasonal variations of land cover and soil moisture conditions are important hydrologically. These sources of variation along with the variation introduced into floods by the storm-to-storm variation in rainfall cause the variation in the floods in the annual maxi- mum flood series. These factors are usually considered as sources of random variation and do not violate the assumption of watershed homogeneity. Major land use changes, including urban development, afforestation, and deforestation, introduce a source of variation into a flood record that violates the assumption of homogene- TABLE 5-14 Adjustment of Rubio Wash Annual Flood Record for Urbanization Measured Series Ordered Data Urbani- zation Annual Exceed.

Where these systematic variations are hydrologically significant, they can introduce consid- erable variation into a flood record such that flood magnitudes or probabilities estimated from a flood frequency analysis will not be accurate indicators of flooding for the changed watershed condition. For example, if a watershed had undergone urban development from 0% to 50% im- perviousness over the duration of the flood record and flood magnitudes will be computed from a flood frequency analysis for the current state of 50% imperviousness, then estimates from the frequency curve will not be representative of this condition because many of the floods used to derive the frequency curve were for a condition of much less urban development. Where a flood record is suspected of laclung homogeneity, the data should be tested prior to making a flood frequency analysis. Statistical tests are intended to be used for thls purpose, although the result of a statistical test should not be accepted unless a hydrologic basis for the result is strongly suspected. That is, before a flood record is adjusted, the results of both hydrologic and statistical assessments should suggest the need for adjustment. Several statistical methods are available to test for nonhomogeneity. The selection of a test is not arbitrary. The type of nonhomogeneity should be considered in selecting the test to use. Urban development can take place abruptly or gradually. In hydrologic terms, an abrupt change is one that occurs over a small portion of the length of record. For example, a 40-yr flood record collected from 1950 to 1989 on a small watershed that urbanized from 1962 to 1966 would be suitable for analysis with a statistical method appropriate for an abrupt change. Conversely, if the urbanization occurred from 1955 to 1982, then a statistical method sensitive to gradual change would be more appropriate. A test designed for one type of nonhomogeneity but used with another type may not detect the hydrologic effect. If a flood record has been analyzed and found to lack homogeneity, then the flood magnitudes should be adjusted prior to making the frequency analysis. Flood magnitudes computed from an adjusted series can be significantly different from magnitudes computed from the unadjusted series. 290 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Two statistical tests will be introduced here to test for the nonhomogeneity of a flood record. Both are appropriate for records that have undergone a gradual change. Others are available for detecting change in a flood record due to an abrupt watershed change. Spearman test. The Speannan test is appropriate for cases where the watershed change is gradual and annual measures of the watershed change are available for each year of the flood record. In this sense, it is a bivariate test. As an example, if a 20-yr flood record is available and the percentage of impervious cover in the watershed is available for each year of record, then the Spearman test could be used. The Spearman test follows the six general steps of a hypothesis test, which are dis- cussed in Chapter 2: 1. State the hypotheses. With respect to watershed change, the null (H,) and alternative (HA)h ypotheses are as follows: H,: The magnitude of the flood peaks are independent of the urbanization. HA: Urbanization increases the magnitudes of the flood peaks. The statement of the alternative hypothesis indicates that the test is applied as a one- tailed test, with a positive correlation expected. 2. Specify the test statistic. The Spearman test uses the following test statistic, which is referred to as the Spearman correlation coefficient (R,): where n is the sample size, and dii s the i\" difference in the ranks of the two series. In this case, the two series would be the series of annual peaks and the series of the average annual percentage of urbanization (that is, imperviousness). The measurements of each series are ranked from largest to smallest and the difference in ranks d; computed. 3. Set the level of significance. While the value of 5% is used most frequently, values of 1% and 10% are also used. The decision is most often made from convention rather than as a rational analysis of the situation. 4. Compute the sample value of the test statistic. The sample value of R, is found using the following steps: (a) While keeping the two series in chronological order, find the rank of each event in each series. (b) Compute the difference in ranks for each i. (c) Compute the value of the Spearman test statistic R, using Equation 5-3 1. 5. Obtain the critical value of the test statistic. For this test, the critical value is obtained from Table 5-16. The values in the table are for the upper tail. Since the distribution of R, is symmetric, critical values for the lower tail, if needed, are obtained by placing a negative sign in front of the value from Table 5-1 6. 6. Make a decision. For an upper one-tailed test, the null hypothesis is rejected if the computed value (Step 4) is larger than the critical value (Step 5). For a lower one-tailed Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 29 1 TABLE 5-16 Critical Values for the Spearman Correlation Coefficient for the Null Hypothesis H,: Ip,l = 0 and both the One-Tailed Alternative Ha: Ip, I > 0 and the Two-Tailed Alternative Ha: p, # 0 Level of Significance for a One-Tailed Test Level of Significance for a Two-Tailed Test Sample size 0.100 0.050 0.020 0.0 10 test, the null hypothesis is rejected if the computed value is more negative than the crit- ical value. For a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis is rejected if the computed value lies in either tail, but the level of significance is twice that of the one-tailed test. If the null hypothesis is rejected, one can conclude that the watershed change has caused a significant hydrologic change in the annual maximum flood series. Example 5-12 Table 5-17 gives nine annual maximum floods for the Compton Creek watershed at Greenleaf Drive in Los Angeles. The corresponding imperviousness is also given. Since the temporal trend is gradual, rather than abrupt, the Spearman test is appropriate. The ranks of the series are given in columns 4 and 5 of Table 5-27, along with the differ- ences in column 6. The computed value of R, is Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-17 Speannan and Spearman-Conley Tests of Compton Creek Flood Record Annual Average Maximum Imperv- Rank Rank Discharge iousness of Yi of Xi Difference Year y; xi(\"/.> 'yi 'xi d r - = ? r I . - r XI . - Annual Maximum X, = Rank Rank Discharge offset Y , of Yr of XI Difference Y,(cfs) (cfs) rx, d, = r>,- rx-1 r ~ l From Table 5-16 the critical value is 0.600. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, which leads to the conclusion that the urbanization has had a significant effect on the annual maximum series. Spearman-Conley test. In many cases, the record for the land-use-change vari- able is incomplete. Typically, records of the imperviousness are not available on a year-to- year basis. In such cases, the Spearman test cannot be used. The Spearman-Conley test (Conley and McCuen, 1997) is an alternative test that can be used to test for serial correlation in cases where the values of the land-use-change variable are incomplete. The steps for applying the Spearman-Conley test are as follows: 1. State the hypotheses. For this test, the hypotheses are as follows: H,: The annual flood peaks are serially independent. HA: Adjacent values of the annual flood series are correlated. Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 293 For a flood series suspected of being influenced by urbanization the alternative hypoth- esis could be expressed as a one-tailed test with an indication of positive correlation. Significant urbanization would cause the peaks to increase, which would produce a positive correlation coefficient. 2. Specify the test statistic. Equation 5-31 can also be used as the test statistic for the Spearman-Conley test. However, it will be denoted as R,,. In applying it, the value of n is the number of pairs, which is 1 less than the number of annual maximum flood mag- nitudes in the record. To compute the value of R,,, a second series X, is formed, where X, = Y,_,. The computed value of R,, ranks the values of the two series, each with one fewer value than the original flood series, and uses Equation 5-3 1. 3. Set the level of significance. Again, this is usually set by convention, with a 5% value common. 4. Compute the sample value of the test statistic. The sample value of R,, is computed using the following steps: (a) Create a second series of flood magnitudes (X,) by offsetting the actual series (Y,-,). (b) While keeping the two series in chronological order, identify the rank of each event in each series using a rank of 1 for the largest value and successively larger ranks for events in decreasing order. (c) Compute the difference in ranks for each i. (d) Compute the value of the Spearman-Conley test statistic R,, using Equation 5-3 1. 5. Obtain the critical value of the test statistic. Unlike the Spearman test, the distribution of R,, is not symmetric and is different from that of R,. Table 5-18 gives the critical values for the upper and lower tails. Enter Table 5-18 with the number of pairs of val- ues used to compute R,,. 6. Make a decision. For a one-tailed test, reject the null hypothesis if the computed R,, is greater in magnitude than the value of Table 5-18. If the null hypothesis is rejected, one can conclude that the annual maximum floods are serially correlated. The hydro- logic engineer can then draw the conclusion that the correlation reflects the effect of urbanization. Example 5-13 To demonstrate the Spearman-Conley test, the annual flood series of Compton Creek will be used; however, the test will be made with the assumption that estimates of imperviousness (col- umn 3 of Table 5-17) are not available. The flood series, except for the 1949 event, are listed chronologically in column 7 of Table 5-17. The offset values are given in column 8. While the record has nine floods, only eight pairs are listed in columns 7 and 8. One value is lost because the record must be offset. Thus, n = 8 for this test. The ranks are given in columns 9 and 10, and the difference in ranks in column 11. The sum of squares of the div alues equals 44. Thus, the computed value of the test statistic is 6(44) R,, = 1 - --- = 0.476 83 - 8 For a 5% level of significance and a one-tailed upper test, the critical value (Table 5-18) is 0.464. Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected. The values in the flood series are serially correlated. The serial correlation is assumed to be the result of urbanization. 294 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-1 8 Critical Values for Univariate Analyses with the Spearman-Conley One-Tailed Serial Correlation Test Lower-Tail Upper-Tail Level of Significance (96) Level of Significance (%) S amp1e Size 10 5 1 0.5 0.1 10 5 1 0.5 0.1", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of frequency analysis, what assumption is made about the watershed?", "answer": "The assumption is that each of the values in the record were sampled from the same population, implying that the watershed has not undergone a systematic change."}, {"question": "Why do major land use changes, such as urban development, violate the assumption of watershed homogeneity?", "answer": "Major land use changes introduce a source of variation into a flood record that violates the assumption of homogeneity, as they can cause significant changes in flood magnitudes or probabilities estimated from a flood frequency analysis, making the estimates not accurate indicators of flooding for the changed watershed condition.

{"paragraph": "5.4.8 Zero-flood Records Many parts of the western United States are classified as arid or semiarid. The classification is based, in part, on the rainfall. However, vegetation and soils are also factors in classification. Generally spealung, arid lands are those where natural rainfall is inadequate to support crop growth. Semiarid lands are those where rainfall is only sufficient to support short-season crops. From an engineering hydrology standpoint, arid and semiarid lands are characterized by little rainfall, which: when it does occur, is usually of an intense nature with runoff having a rapid response. Flash flooding is a major concern in such areas. Hydrologic data are typically not available in arid and semiarid areas, at least in signif- icant quantities. Where gages have been installed, the records often include years in which little or no rainfall occurred and thus, no significant runoff. In other years, intense rainfalls of short duration produce high peak discharges relative to the total volume of runoff. These fac- tors make it comparatively difficult to provide estimates of flood magnitudes or probabilities. Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 295 Annual maximum flood records that include values of zero are not uncommon in arid regions. Thus. a frequency curve based on logarithms, such as the log-Pearson Type 111, can- not be developed because the logarithm of zero is minus infinity. Furthermore, very small runoff magnitudes that are not associated with out-of-bank flow are not really floods and should not be included in flood analyses, even when they are the largest flow for the year. In such cases, Bulletin 17B provides a method for computing a frequency curves for records that include zero-flood years. The method involves the conditional probability adjustment. When this method is applied, three frequency curves are computed; these are referred to as the initial or unadjusted curve, the conditional frequency curve, and the synthetic frequency curve. The selection from among the curves to make estimates of flood magnitudes is based on the assessment of the hydrologist. The procedure to follow when analyzing records that include zero-flood years consists of the following six steps: 1. Preliminary analysis 2. Check for outliers 3. Compute unadjusted frequency curve 4. Compute conditional frequency curve 5. Compute synthetic frequency curve 6. Select a curve to make estimates These steps are discussed in detail. Preliminary analysis. The first step in the analysis is to separate the record into two parts, the non-zero floods and the zero floods. The procedures can only be applied when the number of zero-flood years does not exceed 25% of the record; thus, in which n, is the number of zero-flood years, and N, is the total record length including those years with zero floods. After eliminating the zero-flood years, the mean, standard devi- ation, and standardized skew coefficient of the logarithms are computed with the remainder of the data. The skew should be rounded to the nearest tenth. Check for outliers. The test for outliers given in Bulletin 17B should be applied (see Section 5.4.5). While low outliers are more common than high outliers in flood records from arid regions, tests should be made for both. The procedure depends on the station skew. If station skew is less than -0.4, check for low outliers first. If station skew is greater than +0.4, check for high outliers first. If the skew is between -0.4 and +0.4, a check for both high and low outliers should be made simultaneously. If low outliers are identified, then they are censored (for example, deleted from the flood record) and the moments recomputed. When high outliers are identified, the moments must be recomputed using the historic-peak adjustment; this requires historic flood information. If historic information is not available, then the hish outlier must be retained in the record. 296 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Compute unadjusted frequency curve. The moments of the logarithms from Step 1, or from Step 2 if outliers were identified, are used to compute the unadjusted fre- quency curve. For this step, station skew rather than weighted skew should be used. For se- lected exceedence probabilities, values of the LP3 deviates (K) are obtained from Appendix (Y) 5-1 for the station skew. The deviates are then used with the log mean and log standard deviation (S,) to compute the logarithm of the discharge: The computed discharges are then obtained by Q = loY.T he frequency curve can be plotted using the Q values and the exceedence probabilities used to obtain the corresponding values of K. The data points can be plotted using a plotting position formula. Compute the conditional frequency curve. To derive the conditional fre- quency curve, the conditional probability 01,) is computed as: N, - n.,. - number of floods excluding zero values (5-34) N, - PC= total number of years in record If historic information is available, then the conditional probability should be computed by Equation 5-35 rather than Equation 5-34: in which H is the historic record length, L is the number of peaks truncated, and W is the sys- tematic record weight. The probability pc is then multiplied by each probability used to obtain the K values and plot the unadjusted frequency curve in Step 3. The adjusted probabilities and the discharges computed with Equation 5-33 are plotted on frequency paper to form the condi- tional frequency curve. If the curve is plotted on the same paper as the unadjusted curve from Step 3, then the conditional frequency curve can be compared to the measured data points. Compute the synthetic frequency curve. The conditional frequency of Step 4 does not have known moments. Approximate values, which are referred to as synthetic sta- tistics, can be computed. Since there are three moments, three points on the conditional fre- quency curve will be used to fit the synthetic frequency curve. Specifically, the discharge values for exceedence probabilities of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.50 are used. The discharges are ob- tained from the conditional frequency curve. The following equations are used to compute the synthetic statistics: in which KO.,, and KO.,, are the LP3 deviates obtained from Appendix 5-1 for the synthetic skew G,. Equation 5-36 for the synthetic skew is an approximation for use between skew Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 297 values of -2.0 and +2.5. If appropriate, the synthetic skew can be used to compute a weighted skew, which would be used in place of the synthetic skew. The synthetic statistics can then be used to compute the synthetic frequency curve. When verifying the synthetic curve, the plotting positions for the synthetic curve should be based on either the total number of years of record or the historic record length H, if the his- toric adjustment is used. Select a frequency curve. The first five steps have resulted in three frequency curves: the unadjusted, the conditional, and the synthetic curves. All three are of potential value for making flood estimates. Each should be compared to the measured data and the goodness of fit assessed. The disadvantages of the unadjusted curve are that it uses station skew, which can be highly variable for small record lengths, and that it does not account for the zero years in the record, which can be significant if the number of zero-flood years is rel- atively large. The adjustment with Equation 5-34 or Equation 5-35 is an attempt to over- come the lack of accountability for zero-flood years, but since the zero-flood years are essen- tially years of low rainfall, applying the adjustment of Equation 5-34 to the high-flow years may produce a distortion on the high end of the curve. The disadvantages of the synthetic curve are that it depends on three exceedence probabilities, which have been selected con- ceptually, and that the form of Equations 5-36, 5-37, and 5-38 are subjective. These disad- vantages should be considered when selecting one of the curves to make estimates. Example 5-14 Table 5-19 contains the annual maximum discharge record (1932-1973) for Orestimba Creek near Newman, CA (USGS Gaging Station 11-2745). This record was analyzed in Bulletin 17B. The record includes six years in which there was no discharge. To ensure that the adjustment method is applicable, the ratio of the number of zero-flood years to the total record length must be less than or equal to 0.25. In this case, the method can be applied since 6/42 equals 0.143. The six zero values are dropped from the record, which gives n = 36, and the moments of the logarithms computed: 3.0786 = Mean of the logarithms 0.6443 = Standard deviation of the logarithms -0.8360 = Standardized skew coefficient of the logarithms The skew is rounded to the nearest tenth, which in this case is -0.8. The remaining record (n = 36) should be checked for outliers. Since the skew is less than -0.4, the record is first checked for low outliers. For a 36-yr record length, an outlier deviate (KO)o f 2.639 is obtained from Table 5-11. The logarithm of the critical flow for low outliers is computed as follows: .- log Q, =X- KoS = 3.0786 - 2.639(0.6443) = 1.3783 Therefore, the critical flow (Q,) is 23.9 ft3/sec. Since one of the flows in Table 5-19 is less than this critical flow, the 1955 flow of 16 cfs is considered a low outlier. The value is censored and the remaining 35 values are used to compute the following moments of the logarithms: Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-1 9 Annual Maximum Flood Series: Orestimba Creek, CA (Station 11-2745) Flow Log of Plotting Year (ems) Flow Probability *Zero-flow year 'Low outlier Sec. 5.4 Adjustments of the Frequency Curve 3.132 1 = Mean of the logarithms 0.5665 = Standard deviation of the logarithms -0.4396 = Standardized skew of the logarithms It is next necessary to check for high outliers. For a sample size of 35, the outlier deviate (KO)f rom Table 5-1 1 is 2.628. Thus, the logarithm of the critical flow for high outliers is Therefore, the critical flow (Q,) is 41,770 ft3/sec. None of the flows in the record exceeded this; thus, there are no high outliers. The unadjusted curve is computed using the 35 values. The mean, standard deviation, and skew of the logarithms are given above. The skew is rounded to -0.4. The computations of the unadjusted curve are given in Table 5-20 and the curve is shown in Figure 5-23, with the values of column 4 of Table 5-20 plotted versus the exceedence probabilities of column 1. Using the statistics for the censored series with n = 35, the conditional frequency curve is computed using the conditional probability adjustment. Log-Pearson Type I11 deviates are ob- tained from Appendix 5-1 for a skew of -0.4 and selected exceedence probabilities (see Table 5-20). Since there are 35 events remaining after removing the zero flows and the outlier, the ex- pected probability of Equation 5-33 is 35/42 = 0.8333. The frequency curves with and without the conditional probability adjustment are shown in Figure 5-23. The conditional curve graphs the flow of column 4 of Table 5-20 versus the probability of column 5. The measured data (n = 35) are also plotted in Figure 5-23. Neither curve provides a good representation of the data in the lower tail. While the low outlier is not in- cluded with the plotted data, it is of interest to plot the point. The synthetic statistics can be computed using Equations 5-36,5-37, and 5-38. These re- quire values of discharges from the adjusted frequency curve for exceedence probabilities of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5, which are denoted as Q,.,,, Q,.,,, and Qo,50r,e spectively. These three values must be estimated graphically because the probabilities do not specifically appear in the compu- tations (column 5) of Table 5-20. There is no mathematical equation that represents the adjusted curve. The values from the adjusted curve of Figure 5-23 are as follows: Q,,, = 17,940 cfs, Q,.,, = 6,000 cfs, and Q,,, = 1060 cfs, respectively. Thus, the synthetic skew of Equation 5-36 is I log (17,940/6000) + Gs = - 2.50 3.12 = - 0.529 log (6000/1060) The computed value of -0.529 should be rounded to the nearest tenth; thus, G, = -0.5. The syn- thetic standard deviation is log (17,940/1060) Ss = = 0.6564 1.95472 - 0.08302 where the values of KO,, and KO,,, are obtained from Appendix 5-1 using the synthetic skew of -0.5. The synthetic mean is xs = log (1060) - 0.08302(0.6564) 300 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 Exceedence Probability (%) 98 95 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 5 2 1 0.5 0.2 -- 800 .- 600 -- 400 -- 200 .- 100 al P 40 .- c(II .- 20 -- 10 , , .- , I 2 , , I 1 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 98 99 FIGURE 5-23 Unadjusted (-), conditional (- -), and synthetic (- - - -) frequency curves for Orestimba Creek, CA.

The synthetic curve is plotted in Figure 5-23. None of the three curves closely follow the trend in the measured data, especially in the lower tail. The synthetic curve is based, in part, on the generalized skew, which is the result of regionalization of values from watersheds that may have different hydrologic characteristics than those of Orestimba Creek. In order to make estimates of flood magnitudes, one of the curves must be selected. This would require knowledge of the watershed and sound judgment of the hydrologist responsible for the analysis.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of arid and semiarid lands, how do hydrologists typically characterize the rainfall and runoff patterns?", "answer": "Hydrologists typically characterize arid and semiarid lands by little rainfall, which, when it does occur, is usually of an intense nature with runoff having a rapid response, leading to flash flooding as a major concern."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to provide estimates of flood magnitudes or probabilities in arid and semiarid areas?", "answer": "It is challenging because hydrologic data are typically not available in significant quantities, and where gages have been installed, the records often include years with little or no rainfall and thus no significant runoff, making it difficult to analyze and predict flood patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of frequency analysis, what is the purpose of the conditional probability adjustment in records that include zero-flood years?", "answer": "The conditional probability adjustment is used to account for the years with zero floods in the record, providing a more accurate representation of flood frequencies by adjusting the probabilities of flood events. This adjustment is crucial because the presence of zero-flood years can significantly affect the accuracy of flood frequency curves, especially when using methods like the log-Pearson Type III, which cannot handle zero values directly."}, {"question": "How do hydrologists select a frequency curve for making flood estimates when dealing with records that include zero-flood years?", "answer": "Hydrologists select a frequency curve by comparing the unadjusted, conditional, and synthetic curves to the measured data, assessing the goodness of fit, and considering the disadvantages of each curve. The selection is based on the assessment of the hydrologist, taking into account factors such as the variability of the station skew, the impact of zero-flood years, and the subjective nature of the equations used to compute synthetic statistics."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the synthetic frequency curve for flood estimation, especially in terms of its dependence on selected exceedence probabilities and the form of the equations used?", "answer": "The synthetic frequency curve's dependence on selected exceedence probabilities (0.01, 0.1, and 0.50) and the subjective form of the equations (5-36, 5-37, and 5-38) can introduce uncertainties and potential biases in flood estimates. This method, while useful for approximating flood frequencies, requires careful consideration of these limitations and the specific hydrologic characteristics of the watershed being analyzed. Furthermore, the use of synthetic statistics, which are approximations, can affect the accuracy of the flood frequency curve, especially when compared to more direct methods of analysis."}, {"question": "In the context of the example provided for Orestimba Creek, CA, why did the hydrologist need to check for outliers in the flood record, and how did this affect the computation of the frequency curves?", "answer": "The hydrologist needed to check for outliers because the presence of low or high outliers can significantly affect the computation of the moments (mean, standard deviation, and skew) of the logarithms of the flood discharges, which are crucial for determining the frequency curves. In the case of Orestimba Creek, a low outlier was identified and censored, leading to the recomputation of the moments. This step is essential to ensure that the frequency curves accurately represent the flood characteristics of the watershed, as outliers can distort the analysis and lead to incorrect flood magnitude estimates."}, {"question": "How does the conditional probability adjustment account for the years with zero floods in the record, and what is the formula used for this adjustment?", "answer": "The conditional probability adjustment accounts for the years with zero floods by computing the conditional probability as the ratio of the number of floods excluding zero values to the total number of years in the record. The formula used is N - n, / N, where N is the total record length and n, is the number of zero-flood years. This adjustment is then applied to the probabilities used to obtain the LP3 deviates, effectively scaling the probabilities to account for the presence of zero-flood years in the record."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in selecting the appropriate frequency curve for flood estimation in arid and semiarid regions, and how do hydrologists address these challenges?", "answer": "The challenges include the variability of the station skew, the impact of zero-flood years, and the subjective nature of the equations used for synthetic statistics. Hydrologists address these challenges by carefully evaluating the goodness of fit of each curve to the measured data, considering the hydrologic characteristics of the watershed, and using sound judgment based on experience and knowledge of the specific region. This process involves a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each curve, including the unadjusted, conditional, and synthetic frequency curves, to select the most appropriate one for making accurate flood estimates."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.5 RISK ASSESSMENT Three probability distributions have been used to construct flood frequency curves: the nor- mal, the log-normal, and the log-Pearson Type 111. Other probability distributions, including the extreme value and the Wakeby, have been proposed and used as alternatives to the above 302 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 TABLE 5-21 Computation of the Synthetic Frequency Curve (1) (2) Exceedence LP3 Probability Deviate (K) p, for g = -0.4 three distributions. This suggests that the true distribution is unknown. Our lack of knowl- edge about the true distribution is one source of uncertainty with computed flood frequency curves. Random sampling is a second source of uncertainty that would exist even if we knew the correct distribution function to use in representing the population. Statistical confidence intervals are the means of placing bounds on the uncertainty due to statistical sampling. Even if we know the true or correct probability distribution to use in computing a flood frequency curve and also the correct parameter values, we would not be certain about the oc- currence of floods over the design life of an engineering structure. A culvert might be de- signed to pass the 10-yr flood (that is, the flood that has an exceedence probability of 0.1), but over any period of 10 years, the capacity may be reached as many as 10 times or not at all. A cofferdam constructed to withstand up to the 50-yr flood may be exceeded shortly after being constructed, even though the dam will only be in place for one year. These are chance occurrences that are independent of the lack of knowledge of the true probability distribu- tion. That is, the risk would exist even if we knew the true population. Such risk of failure or design uncertainty can be estimated using the concept of binomial risk. The binomial distribution is a probability mass function that provides a means of esti- mating probabilities of discrete random variables that meet the following four conditions: (1) there are n trials in the experiment; (2) there are only two possible outcomes for each trial; (3) the probability of occurrence is constant from trial to trial; and (4) the trials are indepen- dent. If we define our random variable to be the occurrence of a flood in any one year and as- sume that the probability defined by the flood frequency curve is constant from year to year, then the occurrence of the random variable can be described by the binomial probability dis- tribution. Letting n and p represent the project life and probability of occurrence of a specific flood magnitude, respectively, the probability that a flood of a certain magnitude will occur exactly x times in the n years is given by Sec. 5.5 Risk Assessment 303 The probability of the 25-yr flood (that is7p = 0.04) not occurring (that is, x = 0) in a period of 5 years (that is, n = 5) is Therefore, there is an 18.5% chance of getting one or more (up to five) such floods in 5 years. The probability of exactly one occurrence of the 25-yr flood is Table 5-22 provides some additional examples of binomial risk for the 10-yr and 100-yr events. Example 5-15 A bridge with a design life of 40-yr is designed to pass the 100-yr flood. The design engineer is interested in the probability that the bridge will be submerged during its design life. For a 100-yr design, the exceedence probability is 0.01. For a design life of 40-yr, the probability of the bridge being submerged exactly i times in 40-yr is where i = 0, 1,2, ..., 40. The probability of exactly two submergences in 40-yr is: TABLE 5-22 Binomial Risk Probabilities (P(i)) of i Occurrences for Design Life of n Years and an Exceedence Probability p (a) n = 10 years (b) n = 100 years (c) n = 50 years p = 0.10 p = 0.01 p = 0.10 T = 10 years T = 100 years T = 10 years Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 The following summarizes the probabilities: Thus, the probability that the bridge will be submerged in a 40-yr period is 1-0.6690 = 0.331. The probability of 5 or more submergences is 0.0002.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, what are the primary sources of uncertainty in computing flood frequency curves?", "answer": "The primary sources of uncertainty in computing flood frequency curves are the lack of knowledge about the true distribution and random sampling. The true distribution is unknown, and even if it were known, random sampling would still introduce uncertainty. Statistical confidence intervals can help place bounds on the uncertainty due to statistical sampling."}, {"question": "How does the binomial distribution apply to estimating the risk of flood occurrence over the design life of an engineering structure?", "answer": "The binomial distribution applies by defining the random variable as the occurrence of a flood in any one year, assuming the probability defined by the flood frequency curve is constant from year to year. This allows for the estimation of probabilities of discrete random variables that meet specific conditions, such as a fixed number of trials (years), two possible outcomes (flood or no flood), constant probability of occurrence, and independent trials. The binomial probability distribution can then estimate the probability that a flood of a certain magnitude will occur exactly x times in n years."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to predict the occurrence of floods over the design life of an engineering structure, even with knowledge of the true probability distribution?", "answer": "It is challenging because the occurrence of floods is subject to chance, independent of the lack of knowledge of the true probability distribution. Even if the true distribution is known, the actual occurrence of floods can vary significantly over the design life, as illustrated by the example of a culvert designed to pass the 10-yr flood, which may be exceeded multiple times or not at all over a 10-year period. This uncertainty is inherent in the natural variability of flood events."}, {"question": "In the context of designing engineering structures, how does the concept of binomial risk help in estimating the probability of structure failure due to flooding?", "answer": "The concept of binomial risk helps by estimating the probability of a flood of a certain magnitude occurring exactly x times in n years, where n is the design life of the structure. This allows designers to assess the likelihood of structure failure due to flooding over its design life, taking into account the probability of flood occurrence and the number of years the structure is expected to be in place. For example, a bridge designed to pass the 100-yr flood can have its risk of submergence estimated over its 40-yr design life, providing valuable information for design and risk assessment."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the exceedence probability in flood frequency analysis, and how is it used in the binomial risk assessment?", "answer": "The exceedence probability represents the likelihood of a flood event exceeding a certain magnitude. In binomial risk assessment, the exceedence probability is used as the probability of occurrence (p) in the binomial distribution, allowing for the estimation of the probability of a flood event occurring exactly x times in n years. For instance, an exceedence probability of 0.01 for a 100-yr flood event is used to estimate the risk of a bridge being submerged during its design life."}, {"question": "Why do engineers need to consider the binomial risk of flood occurrence when designing structures, even if the structure is designed to withstand a flood event with a low exceedence probability?", "answer": "Engineers need to consider the binomial risk because even a low exceedence probability does not guarantee that the flood event will not occur during the structure's design life. The binomial risk assessment provides a more comprehensive understanding of the likelihood of structure failure due to flooding, taking into account the number of years the structure is expected to be in place and the probability of flood occurrence. This is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of the structure over its design life."}, {"question": "In the context of flood risk assessment, how does the duration of the design life of an engineering structure influence the estimated risk of flood occurrence?", "answer": "The duration of the design life significantly influences the estimated risk of flood occurrence. A longer design life increases the likelihood of a flood event occurring, even if the exceedence probability is low. For example, a structure designed to withstand a 100-yr flood event has a higher risk of being exceeded over a 40-yr design life compared to a shorter design life. This highlights the importance of considering the design life in flood risk assessments to ensure that structures are designed to withstand the expected flood events over their intended lifespan."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the binomial distribution in flood risk assessment, and how does it contribute to a more accurate estimation of flood risk?", "answer": "The use of the binomial distribution in flood risk assessment provides a more accurate estimation of flood risk by taking into account the probability of flood occurrence and the number of years the structure is expected to be in place. This approach acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in flood events and provides a probabilistic framework for assessing the likelihood of structure failure due to flooding.

{"paragraph": "5.6 PARTIAL-DURATION SERIES For typical engineering design problems, the annual-maximum series analysis (see Section 5.3) provides the necessary discharge magnitude and exceedence probability. Generally, these design problems require a discharge magnitude for a return period of five years or more. Some types of problems require discharge magnitudes that are much smaller than the 5-yr flood. Flow rates that occur more frequently than once a year are needed in many types of problems, such as in nonpoint source pollution analyses, aquatic habitat analyses, con- structed wetland design, small watershed design where damages are not expected, stream restoration projects, and channel erosion analyses. In cases such as these, the return period concept of Equation 4-1 is not appropriate because it does not apply to events with less than the 1- yr magnitude. Langbein (1949) indicates that the lowest of the annual floods is considered to be the 1-yr flood. The Weibull plotting position formula would suggest a return period of (N+l)IN, where N is the record length. Where smaller magnitudes are of interest, a partial-duration se- ries analysis can be undertaken. A partial-duration-series analysis is a frequency analysis that uses all measured dis- charges (or stages) above a threshold, which can be either the bankfull discharge, the lowest value of record, or some other recognizable criterion. The threshold may be set so that the number of events in the series equals an average of three to four flows per year. Thus, for a record of 30 years, the highest 90 to 120 magnitudes would be used. Each flood magnitude should be hydrologically independent of the other events in the series. This is difficult to as- sess. Langbein (1949) indicates that every pair of discharge values in a partial series should be separated by a substantial recession in stage and discharge. A more specific criterion is needed to actually assemble a partial duration series from a flood record. As an example, the criterion might be that the discharge on the recession between the two peaks must fall to at least 25% of the first discharge. The specific criterion should be set prior to analyzing the event. It may also be realistic to set a time period, say one week, that is used to identify inde- pendent events. The concept of a return period, at least as it is applied to an annual-maximum series, cannot be rigorously applied to partial-duration series. The return period from an annual- maximum series represents an average interval in which a flood magnitude will recur as an Sec. 5.6 Partial-Duration Series 305 annual-maximum (Langbein, 1949). The recurrence interval from a partial-duration series is the average interval between floods of a specified magnitude; this does not reflect a time pe- riod, whereas the annual-maximum series specifies a time period of one year. Langbein (19 49) provided the correspondence between return periods of an annual-maximum series and the recurrence interval for partial-duration series (see Table 5-23). Example 5-16 A flood record for the Whitemarsh Run at Whitemarsh, MD (USGS Gage No. 01585100) for the period of record available (Feb. 1959 to Sept. 1989) is given in Table 5-24. The threshold dis- charge is 282 ft3/sec; this was used because it is the smallest discharge in the annual maximum record and it provided a partial-series record length of 121 events, which represents an average of 4.2 stonns per year. Since the largest measured discharge (that is, 8000 ft3/s) was over twice the second annual maximum (that is, 3880 ft3/s), the largest value was tested as an outlier using the method of Section 5.4.5. The computed deviate is (Equation 5-23) log (8000) - 3.129 K = = 2.445 0.3166 The detection deviate KO from Table 5-1 1 for a sample size of 29 is 2.549. Since the computed value is less than the critical value, the largest event is not detected as an outlier. The partial-duration series is given in Table 5-24. The annual-maximum events are noted. The return periods for the annual-maximum events and the recurrence intervals for the partial- duration series are expressed using the Weibull plotting position formula.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to making technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1. What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Discussion Question 319 Case. A state agency issues a request for proposals on a floodplain study. Because of the special nature of the specific project, a hydrologist recognizes that only three companies will be qualified to bid on the project; the firm that he works for and two other companies. Given these circumstances, he recognizes that his company could make a substantial profit by rigging the bid. Specifically, he approaches the other two firms with the proposal that they submit proposals with highly inflated price tags. The hydrologist will then submit a pro- posal with a cost figure that is below the dollar amount submitted by the other companies but still highly inflated. The hydrologist indicates to the two other companies that he will work with them on future efforts where the other companies will be awarded highly inflated con- tracts. The other firms agree to participate in the bid rigging scheme. 320 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients Sec. 5.6 Partial-Duration Series 321 APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients (Continued) (continued) 322 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients (Continued) Sec. 5.6 Partial-Duration Series 323 APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients (Continued) (continued) 324 Frequency Analysis Chap. 5 APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients (Continued) Set. 5.6 Partial-Duration Series APPENDIX 5-1 Exceedence Probability Coefficients (Continued) Subsurface Hydrology CHAPTER OBJECTIVES 1.

Sec. 6.1 Introduction", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, what are the knowns and unknowns for synthesis with a flood frequency curve?", "answer": "The knowns for synthesis with a flood frequency curve include the mean, standard deviation, and skew of the logarithms of the sample points, while the unknowns include the probability of observed events and the return period for a given flood magnitude."}, {"question": "How does the return period concept of Equation 4-1 apply to events with less than the 1-yr magnitude in partial-duration series analysis?", "answer": "The return period concept of Equation 4-1 does not apply to events with less than the 1-yr magnitude in partial-duration series analysis because it is based on the annual-maximum series, which only considers the largest event in each year. In contrast, partial-duration series analysis considers all events above a certain threshold, regardless of their annual ranking."}, {"question": "Why is it difficult to assess the hydrological independence of events in a partial-duration series?", "answer": "Assessing the hydrological independence of events in a partial-duration series is challenging because it requires determining whether each flood magnitude is independent of the other events in the series. This involves evaluating the recession in stage and discharge between events, which can be subjective and may not always be clear-cut. A more specific criterion, such as the discharge on the recession between the two peaks falling to at least 25% of the first discharge, may be needed to assemble a partial duration series from a flood record."}, {"question": "In the context of log-Pearson Type III distribution, how does the weighted skew coefficient account for both station skew and map skew?", "answer": "The weighted skew coefficient in log-Pearson Type III distribution accounts for both station skew and map skew by combining the two estimates using a weighting factor. This allows for a more accurate representation of the skewness of the distribution, which is essential for estimating flood frequencies and return periods. The weighted skew coefficient is calculated using the sample skew, the map skew, and the standard error of the sample skew."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a log-normal distribution versus a log-Pearson Type III distribution for flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The choice between a log-normal distribution and a log-Pearson Type III distribution for flood frequency analysis has significant implications for the estimated flood frequencies and return periods. A log-normal distribution assumes a symmetrical distribution of the logarithms of the flood peaks, while a log-Pearson Type III distribution allows for skewness in the distribution. Using a log-normal distribution may underestimate the flood frequencies for large events, while using a log-Pearson Type III distribution can provide a more accurate representation of the flood frequency curve, especially for large events."}, {"question": "How does the method of moments estimate the parameters of a probability density function in flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The method of moments estimates the parameters of a probability density function in flood frequency analysis by equating the sample moments (e.g., mean, variance, skewness) with the corresponding population moments. This method provides a straightforward way to estimate the parameters of the distribution, such as the mean, standard deviation, and skew coefficient, which are essential for flood frequency analysis."}, {"question": "In the context of flood risk analysis, why is it essential to consider the probability of flooding in consecutive years?", "answer": "Considering the probability of flooding in consecutive years is crucial in flood risk analysis because it allows for the estimation of the likelihood of repeated flooding events. This is essential for designing flood protection measures, such as levees or flood-control structures, which must be able to withstand multiple flooding events. The probability of flooding in consecutive years can be estimated using the binomial probability function, which assumes that floods in adjacent years are independent and that the probability of flooding is constant from year to year."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in estimating the skew coefficient for a flood frequency analysis, and how can they be addressed?", "answer": "Estimating the skew coefficient for a flood frequency analysis can be challenging due to the limited sample size and the presence of outliers in the data. These challenges can be addressed by using a regional map of skew coefficients, which provides a more robust estimate of the skew coefficient. Additionally, the weighted skew coefficient can be used, which combines the sample skew with the map skew using a weighting factor. This approach can provide a more accurate representation of the skewness of the distribution, especially when the sample size is limited."}, {"question": "How does the log-Pearson Type III distribution account for the skewness of the flood frequency curve?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III distribution accounts for the skewness of the flood frequency curve by introducing a skewness parameter, which allows for the representation of asymmetric distributions. This is achieved by using the logarithms of the flood peaks, which can be skewed, and estimating the skew coefficient using the sample data. The log-Pearson Type III"}]}

It is an essential parameter in predicting the behavior of groundwater systems, especially in confined aquifers. The storativity value helps hydrologists determine the aquifer's ability to release water from storage, which is vital for managing groundwater resources sustainably."}, {"question": "How does the hydraulic conductivity (K) influence the movement of water in an aquifer?", "answer": "Hydraulic conductivity (K) is a measure of the ease with which water can flow through the aquifer material. It plays a critical role in determining the velocity of groundwater flow, with higher K values indicating greater permeability and faster flow rates. The hydraulic conductivity is influenced by the properties of the aquifer material, such as grain size and porosity, and is a key factor in predicting groundwater flow and contaminant transport."}, {"question": "In the context of well function, what is the purpose of the variable \"u\" in W(u)?", "answer": "The variable \"u\" in the well function W(u) represents a dimensionless parameter that is used to calculate the drawdown in a well. It is a function of the aquifer properties, such as storativity and transmissivity, as well as the pumping rate and time. The well function W(u) is used to predict the drawdown in a well and to design pumping tests, which are essential for determining the hydraulic properties of an aquifer."}, {"question": "Why is the Reynold's Number (R) important in hydrology?", "answer": "The Reynold's Number (R) is important in hydrology because it helps to determine the nature of fluid flow, whether it is laminar or turbulent. In groundwater flow, a low Reynold's Number indicates laminar flow, which is typical in most aquifers.

{"paragraph": "6.1 INTRODUCTION A brief look at a list of job openings in the field of hydrology is one way to develop an awareness of the importance of knowledge of ground water hydrology. It is probably the area of specialty in the field of hydrology where the greatest demand for employment currently exists. In many locations, water stored in geologic formations is the primary source of water for personal, municipal, commercial, industrial, and agricultural uses. In these cases, surface water supply sources are nonexistent or too costly to use. In many agricultural communities, irrigation is required, and knowledge of soil moisture and soil-water-plant interactions is necessary to maintain productivity. Subsurface Hydrology Chap. 6 In the past, hazardous chemicals were disposed of by burying tanks filled with the waste chemicals; at the time this was the least costly alternative for disposal. In time, corro- sion of the tanks has allowed the wastes to leak into adjacent geologic formations, which rep- resents a significant public health hazard. Many job openings are available for those with experience andlor knowledge of the transport of hazardous wastes through geologic formations. An understanding of the flow of water into and through the soil system is important to many engineering design problems. The characteristics of soil and their interaction with water is important in the design of building foundations, roadways and other transportation facilities, sewage lagoons, sanitary landfills, septic tanks, dams, bridge piers, and levees. Soil characteristics are an important factor in estimating flood magnitudes, which is a primary topic of this book. Knowledge of ground water hydrology is also important to those who work in the field of surface water flood hydrology. While maximum flow rates (that is, volumes per unit time) and velocities may cause flood damage and be the primary design variables, this should not imply that soil properties are not important to surface runoff. Soil properties control the rate at which water infiltrates into the soil, percolates through the subsurface geologic forma- tions, and travels through the soil to seep into surface water bodies from below the water sur- face. This rate affects the proportions of rainfall that appear as surface runoff and as ground water losses. Thus the soil properties affect surface water hydrologic designs. Where designs or analyses require knowledge of ground water, factors that can be im- portant include the characteristics of the geologic formation, properties of the water and chemicals if appropriate, the extent of the geologic formation, and both the temporal and spa- tial variation of the water. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the basic concepts and variables related to the geologic formation and to provide examples of how these concepts are important in solving problems related to the movement of water in geologic formations.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrology job openings, what area of specialty currently has the greatest demand for employment?", "answer": "Ground water hydrology is the area of specialty in the field of hydrology where the greatest demand for employment currently exists."}, {"question": "Why is knowledge of soil moisture and soil-water-plant interactions necessary in agricultural communities?", "answer": "Knowledge of soil moisture and soil-water-plant interactions is necessary in agricultural communities to maintain productivity, particularly where irrigation is required."}, {"question": "In the context of hazardous waste disposal, how do corroded tanks filled with waste chemicals impact geologic formations?", "answer": "Corroded tanks filled with waste chemicals allow the wastes to leak into adjacent geologic formations, representing a significant public health hazard.

{"paragraph": "6.1.1 Ground Water The schematic of the hydrologic cycle in Figure 1-1 shows that some of the surface water passes into the ground; this water represents soil moisture in the unsaturated zone, and it is called ground water once it enters the zone of saturation. As was indicated in Chapter 1, urban development reduces the potential for water to enter into the ground, both through re- ductions in the permeability of the ground surface due to land disturbance and the covering of the ground surface with impervious cover materials. The processes of water in the ground are more complex than suggested by the schematic of Figure 1-1. Figure 6-1 shows a schematic of the hydrologic cycle that empha- sizes subsurface water. Water enters (infiltrates) the upper layers of the soil and percolates downward toward the water table. The area above the water table is called the unsaturated zone or zone of aeration, while the zone of saturation is the area below the water table. The soil profile can be divided into two major sections, the zones of aeration and satu- ration. The zone of aeration can be further divided into three subzones: the root zone, the gravitational zone, and the capillary zone. The root zone is also called the soil water zone. In the zone of saturation, water occupies all of the pore space and is under hydrostatic pressure; thls water is referred to as ground water. The upper edge of the zone of saturation is called Sec. 6.1 Introduction Unsaturated zone or zone of saturation intrusion Confined (or artesian) aquifer well Bedrock FIGURE 6-1 Hydrologic cycle: groundwater perspective. the water table. At the water table, the water is at atmospheric pressure. The hydrostatic pres- sure increases with depth below the water table. Above the water table, the pores in the soil structure contain both air and water. The root zone extends from the ground surface to the bottom of the root systems of the surface vegetation; this zone is saturated only for brief peri- ods following substantial rain. It is of special importance to those involved in agricultural uses of the land. The gravitational zone extends from the bottom of the root zone to the top of the capillary zone. Water moves through this zone under gravitational forces, with some water held in place by hygroscopic and capillary forces. Water under gravitational forces in the gravitational zone moves into the capillary zone, which extends from the bottom of the gravitational zone to the water table. Capillary forces control the water content of the capil- lary zone. Very often, confined or artisan aquifers are formed where an impermeable layer cre- ates a confined ground water storage area. A confined aquifer is recharged from surface wa- ters at a distant location where the aquifer intersects the ground surface. An unconfined aquifer is a permeable underground formation having a surface at atmospheric pressure; that is, it is a formation having the water table as its upper layer. Flow in underground formations depends on the slope of the water table (ground water flow in an unconfined aquifer), or the piezometric surface, in a confined aquifer. A considerable volume of water is extracted from underground formations for agricul- tural, municipal, commercial, and industrial water uses. Water pumped from unconfined aquifers can cause significant decreases in the water table, especially in areas close to the well. The depression of the water table near pumped wells is called the zone of depression. As the slope of the water table increases toward the well, the velocity of flow into the well increases. Wells drilled into confined aquifers are called artisan wells. The water will rise in the well to a level that defines the piezometric surface. If the piezometric surface is above the ground level, water will flow freely from the well. 330 Subsurface Hydrology Chap. 6", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the hydrologic cycle, how does urban development affect groundwater recharge?", "answer": "Urban development reduces the potential for water to enter the ground through reductions in the permeability of the ground surface due to land disturbance and the covering of the ground surface with impervious cover materials. This decrease in permeability hinders the infiltration of water into the soil, thereby reducing groundwater recharge. As a result, less water is available to percolate downward toward the water table, ultimately affecting the amount of groundwater available for various uses."}, {"question": "What is the primary distinction between the unsaturated zone and the zone of saturation in terms of water content and pressure?", "answer": "The primary distinction between the unsaturated zone and the zone of saturation is that in the unsaturated zone, the pores in the soil structure contain both air and water, whereas in the zone of saturation, water occupies all of the pore space and is under hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure increases with depth below the water table, and at the water table, the water is at atmospheric pressure."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, why do confined aquifers require recharge from surface waters at a distant location?", "answer": "Confined aquifers require recharge from surface waters at a distant location because they are formed where an impermeable layer creates a confined groundwater storage area. This impermeable layer prevents direct recharge from the surface, necessitating that the aquifer be recharged from a location where it intersects the ground surface, allowing water to infiltrate and eventually reach the confined aquifer. The recharge process is crucial for maintaining the water level and pressure within the confined aquifer, ensuring its sustainability for water supply purposes."}, {"question": "How does the extraction of water from unconfined aquifers affect the water table, and what is the resulting phenomenon called?", "answer": "The extraction of water from unconfined aquifers can cause significant decreases in the water table, especially in areas close to the well. This decrease in the water table creates a depression known as the zone of depression. As the slope of the water table increases toward the well, the velocity of flow into the well increases, indicating that the water table's shape and slope play a critical role in groundwater flow and extraction."}, {"question": "In the context of agricultural uses of land, why is the root zone of special importance?", "answer": "The root zone is of special importance to those involved in agricultural uses of the land because it extends from the ground surface to the bottom of the root systems of the surface vegetation and is saturated only for brief periods following substantial rain. This zone is crucial for plant growth as it provides the necessary water and nutrients. Understanding the dynamics of the root zone is essential for effective agricultural water management, as it directly impacts crop yields and soil health."}, {"question": "What is the difference between an unconfined aquifer and a confined aquifer in terms of their characteristics and behavior?", "answer": "An unconfined aquifer is a permeable underground formation having a surface at atmospheric pressure, with the water table as its upper layer. In contrast, a confined aquifer is formed where an impermeable layer creates a confined groundwater storage area, and its water level is under pressure. The flow in these aquifers depends on the slope of the water table for unconfined aquifers and the piezometric surface for confined aquifers, influencing how water is extracted and managed from these sources."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater extraction, how do wells drilled into confined aquifers differ from those drilled into unconfined aquifers?", "answer": "Wells drilled into confined aquifers, known as artisan wells, differ from those drilled into unconfined aquifers because the water in confined aquifers is under pressure. This pressure causes the water to rise in the well to a level that defines the piezometric surface. If the piezometric surface is above the ground level, water will flow freely from the well, indicating the artesian condition of the aquifer. This natural flow is a result of the pressure difference between the aquifer and the ground surface."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the hydrostatic pressure in the zone of saturation important for groundwater management?", "answer": "Understanding the hydrostatic pressure in the zone of saturation is important for groundwater management because it affects the flow of groundwater and the extraction of water from aquifers. The hydrostatic pressure increases with depth below the water table, and this pressure difference drives the flow of groundwater. Accurately assessing hydrostatic pressure is crucial for predicting groundwater flow rates, designing efficient extraction systems, and managing groundwater resources sustainably."}, {"question": "In the context of subsurface hydrology, what role do capillary forces play in the capillary zone?", "answer": "Capillary forces control the water content of the capillary zone, which extends from the bottom of the gravitational zone to the water table.

{"paragraph": "6.1.2 Hydrologic Classification Given the importance of ground water, it is useful to classify regions of a soil column on the basis of the water content. Two zones can be specified. Where all voids within a column are filled with water, the column is said to be saturated. The water table is the upper limit of the saturated zone. Very often, the term ground water is used to refer to water in the zone of satu- ration. Above the water table, the pore space in the soil column may have both water and air; this zone is referred to as the zone of aeration, or the unsaturated zone. The terms suspended water or vadose water are used to refer to water in the zone of aeration; in practice, this water is simply referred to as soil moisture. Separating the soil column into these two zones is neces- sary because the physical processes and methods of estimation are different in the two zones. The zone of aeration can be further divided into three subzones; the soil-water or root zone, the intermediate zone, and the capillary zone, which is sometimes referred to as the capillary fringe. Water in the zone of aeration may exist as gravity water (that is, water that can drain under the force of gravity), capillary water (that is, water retained by capillary forces), and hygroscopic moisture (that is, water that adheres to the surface of the soil parti- cles as a thin film).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic classification, what are the two primary zones specified in a soil column based on water content?", "answer": "The two primary zones are the saturated zone, where all voids are filled with water, and the zone of aeration (or unsaturated zone), where pore space contains both water and air."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to separate the soil column into saturated and unsaturated zones?", "answer": "Separating the soil column into these two zones is necessary because the physical processes and methods of estimation are different in the two zones.

Gravity water is the water that can drain under the force of gravity, whereas capillary water is retained by capillary forces. Hygroscopic moisture, on the other hand, adheres to the surface of soil particles as a thin film. These types of water differ in their mobility and interaction with the soil matrix, influencing soil moisture dynamics and plant water availability."}, {"question": "How does the concept of the water table relate to the saturated zone?", "answer": "The water table is the upper limit of the saturated zone.

It is significant because it represents the area where capillary forces are strong enough to retain water against gravity, creating a zone of water retention above the water table. This zone plays a crucial role in soil moisture dynamics, affecting the movement of water and nutrients in the soil and influencing plant growth."}, {"question": "In the context of soil moisture, why is the distinction between the saturated and unsaturated zones important for agricultural and hydrological applications?", "answer": "The distinction between the saturated and unsaturated zones is important because it impacts the availability of water for plants and the movement of water through the soil. In the saturated zone, water is readily available but can also lead to waterlogging and reduced aeration, negatively affecting plant growth.

Each type of water has different properties and behaviors, such as mobility, retention, and availability to plants. This classification helps in predicting how water will move through the soil, how it will be retained, and how it can be managed for agricultural, environmental, and hydrological purposes.

By understanding the saturated and unsaturated zones, hydrologists can better estimate groundwater storage, recharge rates, and flow patterns. This knowledge is essential for managing groundwater sustainably, preventing over-extraction, and ensuring the long-term availability of this vital resource. Moreover, recognizing the differences in physical processes between the saturated and unsaturated zones allows for more accurate modeling and prediction of groundwater behavior, which is critical for water resource planning and management."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic classification, what is the role of the intermediate zone within the zone of aeration?", "answer": "The intermediate zone is one of the subzones within the zone of aeration, situated between the soil-water or root zone and the capillary zone.

The difference in the total energy, E, E,, is the head loss, h,, between the two sections. The - head loss is the energy lost to friction and other minor losses. A standpipe is inserted into the cylinder at both cross sections. The water rises in each standpipe to a level equal to the sum of the elevation and pressure heads. A line connecting the water elevations in the stand pipes is referred to as the hydraulic grade line (HGL). The energy grade line (EGL) is the line con- necting the points of total energy E, and E,. Using the apparatus of Figure 6-2, a number of experiments can be conducted. If the flow rate Q is increased, the head loss increases; a direct relationship between Q and h, is ev- ident from the Darcy-Weisbach equation, although the Darcy-Weisbach equation does not apply here. As a second experiment, the length of the cylinder could be doubled while hold- ing the head loss constant. In this case the discharge would be halved; thus the discharge is inversely proportional to the length. Based on these two experiments, the discharge has been - found to be proportional to the ratio of the head loss to the length (for example, Q h,lL). The ratio h,lL equals the slope of the hydraulic grade line and will be denoted here as i; it will be referred to as the hydraulic gradient. A third experiment can be performed by replacing the cylinder of Figure 6-2 with a similar cylinder having an area 2A. The experiment would show that the discharge would - double; thus Q A. The three experiments show that the discharge is related to the area and hydraulic gradient by Q = KiA (6-1 where K is a proportionality constant. Values for K could be determined by performing a number of experiments in which both the fluid passing through the cylinder and the charac- teristics of the soil medium are varied. Because of this dependency, K is called the hydraulic conductivity . The velocity of the flow through the cylinder can be determined using the equation of continuity: The velocity of Equation 6-2 is not the actual velocity of the fluid flowing through the porous medium because the area A of Equation 6-1 is the total cross-sectional area and not the area through which the fluid is flowing. The actual velocity would be larger because the actual area of the pores would be smaller by about 50%. Studies have shown that Darcy's Law is valid for Reynold's numbers less than 1, which covers almost all cases of flow in natural porous media. However, turbulent flow can occur in isolated pores of a porous medium, and Darcy's Law is not valid where such condi- tions dominate. The Reynold's Number (R), which is the ratio of the inertia forces to the vis- cous forces, is given by in which p is the mass density of the fluid, (I, is the absolute or dynamic viscosity of the fluid, v is the kinematic viscosity, V is the flow velocity, and L is a characteristic length.

Since the fluid only flows through the pores, which occupy a smaller area (about 50% smaller), the actual velocity of the fluid is larger than the calculated velocity."}, {"question": "In what conditions is Darcy's Law valid, and what happens when these conditions are not met?", "answer": "Darcy's Law is valid for Reynolds numbers less than 1, which covers almost all cases of flow in natural porous media. However, when turbulent flow occurs in isolated pores of a porous medium, Darcy's Law is not valid. This is because Darcy's Law assumes laminar flow conditions, and the presence of turbulence indicates a departure from these conditions, necessitating the use of different equations or models to accurately describe the flow."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Reynolds Number in the context of flow through porous media, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "The Reynolds Number (R) is significant because it determines whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

The hydraulic gradient, represented by the slope of the hydraulic grade line, determines the driving force behind the flow.

This is because the equation of continuity uses the total cross-sectional area of the cylinder, whereas the fluid actually flows through a smaller area (the pores), resulting in a higher actual velocity."}, {"question": "Why is the hydraulic conductivity (K) considered a dependent variable rather than a constant property of the soil medium?", "answer": "The hydraulic conductivity (K) is considered a dependent variable because its value depends on both the characteristics of the soil medium and the properties of the fluid passing through it. This dependency means that K can vary with changes in the soil or fluid properties, making it a variable that needs to be determined under specific conditions rather than a constant property of the soil medium alone."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.2.1 Hydraulic Conductivity Solving Equation 6-1 for the coefficient K yields Since i is dimensionless, K has units of length per unit time, which is the units of a velocity. It reflects the velocity of flow through the porous medium. The proportionality constant K is called either the hydraulic conductivity or the coefficient of permeability. Experiments have shown that K is a function of both the fluid and the medium through which the fluid is passing. Specifically, K is a function of the specific weight of the fluid (y), the viscosity of the fluid (p), and the size of the pores in the medium. Since the pore size cannot be measured directly, it can be replaced by a representative grain diameter, d. Thus K is functionally related by where a,, a,, and a, are constants and C is a dimensionless proportionality constant.

Table &la provides typical ranges of k for different soil classes. Example 6 1 A pump is discharging 70 gaVmin from a well in a sandy aquifer.

{"paragraph": "6.3 HYDRAULICS OF WELLS While Darcy's Law is a simple relationship that is used to represent flow in a complex physi- cal system, it is still a very useful model. It is commonly used in describing flow from an aquifer to a well. To introduce the conceptual framework the case of a confined aquifer with a full penetrating well can be used. We will make the assumption that the water level in the aquifer is initially horizontal and the water is not moving. When the pump in the well is started, the pressure around the intake of the pump is reduced, which creates a pressure dif- ference between the water in the surrounding aquifer and the pump intake; the water in the aquifer then begins movement to the pump intake where the pressure is lower. This causes the level of water in the aquifer to decrease from its initial horizontal position. Initially, un- steady flow conditions will exist and the level of the water will continue to decrease.

Additionally, the method's simplicity and ease of application make it a practical choice for a wide range of applications, from groundwater resource management to environmental monitoring."}, {"question": "In the context of the Theis Method, what are the implications of plotting (h, - h) versus log,,t?", "answer": "Plotting (h, - h) versus log,,t has significant implications for the analysis of groundwater flow data. By plotting the data in this manner, hydrologists can identify the degree of linearity in the relationship, which is a key assumption in the Theis Method. If the data plot as a straight line, it indicates that the assumptions of the method are met, and the analysis can proceed with confidence. However, if the data do not plot as a straight line, it may indicate that the assumptions are not met, and alternative methods or modifications to the analysis may be necessary. This plot also provides a visual representation of the data, allowing hydrologists to quickly identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that may be indicative of underlying hydraulic processes or issues with the data."}, {"question": "How does the Theis Method account for the complexity of groundwater flow in wells?", "answer": "The Theis Method accounts for the complexity of groundwater flow in wells by using a theoretical framework that simplifies the complex behavior of the system. The method assumes that the flow is radial and that the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic, which allows for the derivation of a simple, analytical solution. This solution, represented by the type curve W(u) vs. u, captures the essential characteristics of the flow, enabling hydrologists to analyze the data and determine key parameters. While the method may not account for all the complexities of real-world systems, it provides a useful approximation that can be refined and improved through additional data collection and analysis."}]}

On semilog paper plot the drawdown versus the time from the start of pumping with the drawdown on the axis with an arithmetic scale and the time plotted on the axis hav- ing a log scale. 2. Draw a straight line through the points from the measured data. 3. Determine the change in the drawdown (in feet) per log cycle; this is denoted as dl - d, in Equation 6-38. 4. Using Equation 6-43, compute the transmissivity. 5. From the straight line on the plot (not the data points) estimate the time at which the drawdown equals zero (the time is denoted as to in Equation 644). 6. Compute the storativity using Equation 6-44. It is important to note that Jacob's Straight-line method uses semilog paper and in ap- plication requires just one graphical plot. On the other hand, the Theis Method uses log-log paper and requires plotting both the type curve and the data curve. The Jacob Straight-line method is an approximation of the Theis method. The accuracy of Jacob's method depends on the importance of terms of Equation 6-3 1 that are truncated in deriving Equation 6-37. Several rules of thumb have been proposed for limiting the use of Jacob's method as an approximation of the Theis method. One rule states that u should be less than 0.01. Others state that t must be greater than 5 % ~ ' which occurs for large values of t and small values of r. Table 6-4 provides the value of W(u) for selected values of u as the terms of the expansion of Equation 6-31 are added. For u equal to 0.1 truncation of terms beyond -ln,u changes the value of W(u) by about 5.5%; for u equal to 0.01, the error is about 0.2%.

Equation 6-30b was used to compute the value of u for each value of t; the values of u are given in Table 6-5. Since all the values are smaller than 0.01, Jacob's method is acceptable.

GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT Ln many localities ground water is a primary source of water supply. Ground water is ex- tracted through wells (see Figure 6-1) as a source of water supply for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. Water serves as a necessary resource. Since ground water supplies are recharged naturally, it is a renewable resource. However, like any renewable resource, it can be depleted if it is not properly managed. The most noticeable visual effect of ground water depletion is the depression of the land surface. Depressions occur because the pore water pressure of the ground water is partly responsible for balancing the pressure force of any external burden and the overlying soil. When the ground water supply is severely de- pleted, the soil structure of the aquifer must support the overlying burden by itself. If it is structurally inadequate, the aquifer consolidates with the depression of the ground surface as a result. Another important effect of the depletion of ground water supplies is the reduction of the water available for pumping. It is more difficult to extract water from a nearly depleted aquifer and h s r educes the supply of water for others, as well as for future generations. The quality of the water may also deteriorate when an aquifer is over-harvested.

This makes Jacob's method an approximation of the Theis method, with its accuracy depending on the importance of truncated terms in the equation derivation."}, {"question": "Why is it important to test the validity of Jacob's method as an approximation of the Theis method in groundwater flow analysis?", "answer": "Testing the validity of Jacob's method is crucial because its accuracy depends on the terms of the equation that are truncated in deriving the method. The method's applicability is limited by rules of thumb, such as u being less than 0.01, and its use should be evaluated to ensure that the approximations made do not significantly affect the results. This is particularly important in groundwater management, where accurate estimates of aquifer characteristics are necessary for sustainable resource use."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater management, what are the implications of depleting groundwater supplies?", "answer": "Depleting groundwater supplies has several significant implications, including the depression of the land surface due to the loss of pore water pressure, reduction in the water available for pumping, and potential deterioration of water quality. These effects not only impact current water users but also future generations, highlighting the need for proper management of this renewable resource to prevent over-harvesting and ensure its sustainability."}, {"question": "How does the depletion of groundwater supplies affect the soil structure of an aquifer?", "answer": "The depletion of groundwater supplies can cause the soil structure of an aquifer to consolidate, leading to the depression of the ground surface. This occurs because the pore water pressure of the groundwater helps balance the pressure force of any external burden and the overlying soil. When groundwater is severely depleted, the aquifer must support the overlying burden by itself, and if it is structurally inadequate, consolidation and land surface depression result."}, {"question": "Why is groundwater considered a renewable resource, and under what conditions can it be depleted?", "answer": "Groundwater is considered a renewable resource because it is naturally recharged. However, it can be depleted if it is not properly managed, meaning that the rate of extraction exceeds the rate of recharge over a sustained period. This highlights the importance of managing groundwater supplies to ensure that they are used sustainably and do not become depleted, which can have long-term consequences for water availability and quality."}, {"question": "In the context of aquifer characteristics, what is the significance of transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) in groundwater flow?", "answer": "Transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) are crucial aquifer characteristics that influence groundwater flow. Transmissivity measures the ability of an aquifer to transmit water, while storativity reflects the aquifer's capacity to store water. Accurate estimates of T and S are essential for understanding groundwater flow behavior, predicting water levels, and managing groundwater resources effectively."}, {"question": "How do the values of u, as computed by Equation 6-30b, affect the validity of using Jacob's method?", "answer": "The values of u, computed by Equation 6-30b, are critical in determining the validity of using Jacob's method. If the values of u are less than 0.01, Jacob's method is considered acceptable as an approximation of the Theis method. This criterion helps in assessing whether the approximations inherent in Jacob's method will significantly impact the accuracy of the estimated aquifer characteristics, thereby guiding the choice of method in groundwater flow analysis."}, {"question": "What are the primary uses of groundwater, and why is its management crucial?", "answer": "Groundwater is primarily used as a source of water supply for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes. Its management is crucial because, despite being a renewable resource, groundwater can be depleted if over-extracted, leading to significant environmental and societal impacts, including land subsidence, reduced water availability, and decreased water quality. Effective management ensures the long-term sustainability of this vital resource."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater depletion, what role does pore water pressure play in maintaining the soil structure of an aquifer?", "answer": "Pore water pressure plays a critical role in maintaining the soil structure of an aquifer by helping to balance the pressure force of any external burden and the overlying soil. When groundwater is depleted, the reduction in pore water pressure can lead to consolidation of the aquifer material, resulting in land surface depression. This underscores the importance"}]}
{"paragraph": "6.5.1 Safe Yield When water is extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge of the aquifer, the water table is lowered. Therefore, the rate of water extraction that can be safely harvested from an aquifer is an important characteristic for ground water management. Thls rate is called the safe yield; specifically, the safe yield is the volume of water that can be extracted from an aquifer during any time period without adversely affecting the supply. In practice, the time period used to compute estimates of safe yield is 1 year. However, recognizing that precipitation, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration rates vary from year to year, and therefore the recharge of ground water supplies varies naturally, a period other than 1 year could be used. Water re- moved from an aquifer in excess of the safe yield is termed overdraft.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of groundwater management, what is the significance of determining the safe yield of an aquifer?", "answer": "The safe yield is crucial because it represents the volume of water that can be extracted from an aquifer without adversely affecting the supply, ensuring sustainable groundwater management."}, {"question": "Why does the water table lower when water is extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge of the aquifer?", "answer": "The water table lowers because the rate of extraction surpasses the rate at which the aquifer is replenished, leading to a decrease in the water level. This imbalance between extraction and recharge is critical for understanding the dynamics of groundwater resources. If the extraction rate continues to exceed the recharge rate, it can lead to significant declines in the water table, potentially affecting the long-term sustainability of the aquifer."}, {"question": "How does the variation in precipitation, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration rates from year to year impact the estimation of safe yield?", "answer": "The variation in these rates affects the recharge of groundwater supplies, which in turn influences the safe yield. Since these factors vary naturally, using a fixed time period, such as one year, for computing safe yield estimates might not fully capture the dynamics of groundwater recharge. Therefore, considering a period other than one year could provide a more accurate representation of the safe yield, taking into account the natural fluctuations in groundwater replenishment."}, {"question": "In the context of aquifer management, what are the implications of extracting water in excess of the safe yield?", "answer": "Extracting water beyond the safe yield, known as overdraft, can have significant implications for the sustainability of the aquifer. Overdraft can lead to a decline in the water table, reducing the availability of groundwater for future use. This not only affects the quantity of water available but can also impact the quality, as deeper water may have different chemical characteristics. Managing aquifers to avoid overdraft is essential for maintaining the health and productivity of these vital water resources."}, {"question": "How does the concept of safe yield relate to the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources?", "answer": "The concept of safe yield is directly linked to the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources. By extracting water at or below the safe yield, groundwater managers can ensure that the aquifer is replenished at a rate that maintains its water level, thereby preserving the resource for future generations. This approach helps in preventing the depletion of groundwater resources, which can have severe environmental, social, and economic consequences. Therefore, understanding and applying the concept of safe yield is fundamental to responsible and sustainable groundwater management."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the time period used for computing estimates of safe yield in groundwater management?", "answer": "Considering the appropriate time period for estimating safe yield is important because it affects the accuracy of the estimate. A one-year period might not capture the variability in recharge due to annual fluctuations in precipitation, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration. Using a longer or more representative period can help in accounting for these variations, leading to a more realistic and sustainable estimate of the safe yield. This, in turn, informs better decision-making in groundwater management, ensuring that extraction rates are aligned with the natural replenishment of the aquifer."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater extraction, what is the term used to describe the removal of water from an aquifer in excess of the safe yield?", "answer": "The term used to describe this condition is \"overdraft.\" Overdraft occurs when the rate of water extraction exceeds the rate at which the aquifer is recharged, leading to a decrease in the water table and potential long-term damage to the aquifer."}, {"question": "How does the safe yield of an aquifer impact decisions related to groundwater use and management?", "answer": "The safe yield significantly influences decisions on groundwater use and management. It serves as a critical threshold beyond which extraction can lead to unsustainable use of the resource. By understanding the safe yield, managers can set limits on groundwater extraction, ensuring that the use of the resource is balanced with its replenishment. This balance is essential for maintaining the health of the aquifer, supporting both current and future water needs, and preventing the adverse effects of overdraft. Therefore, the safe yield is a foundational concept in groundwater management, guiding policies and practices aimed at the sustainable use of groundwater resources."}, {"question": "Why is recognizing the variability in precipitation, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration rates important for groundwater management?", "answer": "Recognizing this variability is important because it affects the recharge rate of the aquifer, which in turn impacts the safe yield. Understanding and accounting for these variations can help in making more accurate estimates of the safe yield, ensuring that groundwater extraction is managed sustainably. This recognition also highlights the need for adaptive management strategies that can respond to changes in these factors over time, maintaining the balance between groundwater use and recharge."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.5.2 Determination of Safe Yield A number of methods have been proposed for estimating the safe yield of an aquifer. The methods reflect differences in the types and quality of data available. The methods are based on a water balance that reflects a water budget of the ground water aquifer. The conservation of mass expressed in Equation 1-1 is repeated here but with a slight change in notation (for example, s for S): For ground water storage, the input (I) consists of the infiltration and percolation of precipi- tation such as seepage from streams, rivers, and lakes as well as water recharged through ar- tificial means such as water spreading or recharge through wells and pits. The output (0)of Equation 6-47 includes evapotranspiration such as seepage to effluent streams and rivers, lakes, and marshes as well as water pumped from the aquifer. The change in the storage (dsldt) of Equation 6-47 can be measured by either (1)t he product of the storage coefficient and the change in the piezometric head, or (2) the product of the specific yield and the change in the elevation of the water table. If measurements of the ground water table at observation wells over long periods of time are available, the safe yield can be determined as the volume rate of water that can be extracted such that the water surface elevation at some current time is the same as at some point in time in the distant past. If significant volumes of water were not being extracted from the aquifer during this time period, the record of water table fluctuations represents the long-term record of natural draft and recharge. Where significant volumes of water have been extracted from the aquifer over the period of record, these volumes must be considered in estimating the safe yield. Three methods of estimating the safe water yield at a site will be presented; other methods are available and are described in the literature. The methods are (1)t he zero fluctu- ation method, (2)t he average draft method, and (3) the water balance method. The water bal- ance method requires estimates of each of the terms in Equation 6-47; therefore, it is the most data intensive and should be the most accurate. The zero fluctuation method requires only annual measurements of the water table elevation, so it is the least data intensive and probably the least accurate. The average draft method requires both annual measurements of 350 Subsurface Hydrology Chap. 6 the water table elevation and a record of annual pumpage from the aquifer.

This relationship is crucial for estimating safe yield because it allows for the calculation of the volume rate of water that can be extracted without depleting the aquifer over time. Understanding this relationship is essential for managing groundwater resources sustainably, as it helps in determining the maximum amount of water that can be safely extracted without causing significant declines in the water table or compromising the long-term viability of the aquifer."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating safe yield, why is it necessary to consider the volumes of water extracted from the aquifer over the period of record, especially if significant volumes have been extracted?", "answer": "Considering the volumes of water extracted from the aquifer over the period of record is necessary because these extractions affect the natural draft and recharge balance of the aquifer. If significant volumes of water have been extracted, the record of water table fluctuations does not solely represent the natural draft and recharge, but also the impact of human activities on the aquifer. Therefore, these volumes must be accounted for to accurately estimate the safe yield and ensure that the aquifer is not over-exploited."}, {"question": "What are the three methods presented for estimating the safe water yield at a site, and how do they differ in terms of data requirements and accuracy?", "answer": "The three methods are the zero fluctuation method, the average draft method, and the water balance method. These methods differ significantly in their data requirements and accuracy. The water balance method is the most data-intensive, requiring estimates of each term in the water balance equation, and is considered the most accurate. In contrast, the zero fluctuation method is the least data-intensive, requiring only annual measurements of the water table elevation, and is likely the least accurate. The average draft method falls in between, requiring both annual measurements of the water table elevation and a record of annual pumpage from the aquifer, and is expected to be an accurate approximation of the water balance method under certain conditions."}, {"question": "How does the average draft method compare to the water balance method in terms of accuracy, particularly when pumpage is the most significant output and variations in precipitation are small?", "answer": "The average draft method is expected to be an accurate approximation of the water balance method when pumpage is the most significant output and variations in precipitation are small. This is because, under these conditions, the impact of pumpage on the aquifer's water balance is dominant, and the method can effectively capture this impact. However, the accuracy of the average draft method may decrease if precipitation variations become significant or if other outputs, such as evapotranspiration, play a more substantial role in the aquifer's water balance."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater management, why is understanding the safe yield of an aquifer crucial, and what are the potential consequences of exceeding this yield?", "answer": "Understanding the safe yield of an aquifer is crucial for managing groundwater resources sustainably. Exceeding the safe yield can lead to significant declines in the water table, compromising the long-term viability of the aquifer and potentially causing environmental, economic, and social impacts.

This balance is crucial for long-term aquifer health and for preventing over-exploitation, which can lead to significant declines in water table elevations and potential land subsidence or other environmental issues."}, {"question": "How does the accuracy of safe yield estimation change with the length of the period of record in the zero fluctuation method?", "answer": "The accuracy of safe yield estimation increases with the length of the period of record. Longer periods capture more annual variability in both water table elevations and drafts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the aquifer's response to extraction. This leads to a more reliable estimate of the safe yield, which is essential for managing groundwater resources sustainably."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the annual draft when estimating safe yield using the zero fluctuation method?", "answer": "Considering the annual draft is important because it directly affects the water table elevation. The total draft over the period of record, when the initial and final water table elevations are the same, gives an indication of the amount of water that can be sustainably withdrawn from the aquifer without causing long-term decline. This is critical for planning and managing water resources to meet demand while preserving aquifer health."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological analysis, what does the concept of \"safe yield\" represent in relation to groundwater extraction?", "answer": "The concept of \"safe yield\" represents the maximum amount of water that can be extracted from an aquifer over a long period without causing an unacceptable decline in the water table elevation. It is a critical parameter in groundwater management, as it helps in determining the sustainable level of groundwater extraction that can meet human demands without compromising the long-term viability of the aquifer."}, {"question": "How does the zero fluctuation method contribute to sustainable groundwater management?", "answer": "The zero fluctuation method contributes to sustainable groundwater management by providing a straightforward approach to estimate the safe yield of an aquifer.

Over-extraction beyond the safe yield can lead to decreased water table levels, increased energy costs for pumping, and potential environmental impacts such as land subsidence and decreased water quality. By understanding the safe yield, managers can develop policies and practices that balance the need for groundwater with the need to protect this vital resource for future generations."}, {"question": "How does the principle of the zero fluctuation method relate to the concept of water balance in hydrology?", "answer": "The principle of the zero fluctuation method is closely related to the concept of water balance in hydrology, as it essentially seeks to balance the inputs (recharge) and outputs (draft) of the aquifer system over a given period. When the water table elevation returns to its initial level after a period of extraction, it indicates that the total draft has been offset by an equivalent amount of recharge, achieving a balance that is fundamental to sustainable groundwater management and maintaining the health of the aquifer."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.5.4 The Average Draft Method The average draft method uses the same type of data as the zero fluctuation method; how- ever, instead of requiring just the total draft for a period during which the water table eleva- tion is the same at the beginning and end of the period, annual values of the change in the water table elevation and the annual draft are required. To compute the safe yield, the annual drafts should be plotted as the abscissa and the change in the annual water table elevation as the ordinate. A line that best represents the data can be fit by either eye or regression; if re- gression analysis is used as the fitting method, the annual draft should be used as the crite- rion (dependent) variable.

{"paragraph": "6.5.5 The Simplified Water Balance Method The simplified water balance method uses Equation 6-47 to compute the safe yield. In many cases, annual precipitation and streamflow are the only data available to represent the inflow and outflow of Equation 6-47. Observation wells can be used to estimate the annual changes in the water table elevation. In this case, the other inputs and outputs are assumed to be rela- tively constant with time and the water balance equation can be reduced to in which the annual change in the water table elevation Ae represents the change in storage, the annual precipitation is assumed to be the input, and the sum of the surface runoff Q and annual draft Qp is the output. If values of the annual draft are not available, P Q can be - plotted against the change in the water table elevation to estimate the safe yield, with the value of Ae used as the ordinate. A line can be fitted to the data, and the safe yield can be es- timated from the value of (P - Q) corresponding to a value of Ae of 0. Example 6-12 Table 6-8 gives annual rainfall and runoff volumes, as well as the annual change in the water table elevation.

{"paragraph": "6.6 ANALYSIS VERSUS SYNTHESIS The concepts of analysis and synthesis apply to ground water hydrology in the same way that they apply to other areas of hydrology. The specific elements of the system of Figure 1-3 de- pend on the particular ground water problem. The input is usually some measure of the avail- able water supply, and the output consists of the supply of water that can be extracted from the ground water system; the system is represented by characteristics of the geologic forma- tion. For Darcy's Law the slope of the hydraulic grade line reflects the potential of the water supply to move from one point to another point in the geologic formation; thus it is the input function. The velocity of the flow or the flow rate represents the output from the system. The system is characterized by the hydraulic conductivity and the dimensions or size of the aquifer. For a given aquifer, the objective of analysis would be to use measurements of the slope of the hydraulic grade line and the flow rate to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. In the synthesis case, estimates of the hydraulic grade line and the hydraulic con- ductivity would be used to estimate the flow through the aquifer. For the methods introduced to describe the hydraulics of wells for steady-state condi- tions, the variables used to define the piezometric surface represent the system input. The flow rate represents the system output, and the hydraulic conductivity and aquifer character- istics define the system transfer function. For unsteady flow conditions the transfer function is represented by the transmissivity and the storativity, the aquifer thickness, and the location of the observation well with respect to the location of the pumping well. The drawdown curve and the pumping rate represent the input and output functions, respectively. In the Subsurface Hydrology Chap. 6 analysis case, the objective would be to estimate the aquifer characteristics, the hydraulic conductivity for steady flow conditions, and the transmissivity and storativity for unsteady flow conditions. In the synthesis case, the objective would be to estimate the discharge rate from the pumping well. In the problems on ground water management, the elevation of the water table reflects the supply of water and is therefore, the input function. The annual draft is the system output. While in the analysis case, measures of the annual draft are available, estimates of the annual draft are made in the synthesis case. The coefficients of the relationship between the change in the water table elevation and the annual draft reflect the characteristics of the aquifer and thus represent the transfer function. In the analysis case, the coefficients must be estimated from measurements of Ae and the annual draft; in the synthesis case, the coefficients and measurements of Ae are used to predict the annual draft.

Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? Discussion Question 357 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case: An entry-level engineer, who specializes in GIs, overlays several surface and subsurface files and recognizes that the design location of a pipeline that will carry haz- ardous waste material from a manufacturing plant to a special remediation facility transects a porous formation that is used as part of the local water supply. The young engineer recog- nizes that, if the pipe leaks, the water supply will be contaminated. When discussing the issue with the project manager, the manager insists that it is not a matter with which he needs to be concerned. The original contract that the engineering firm signed with the manufacturer specifically required that location and a change in location might prevent the project from being undertaken.

Moment estimation B. Uncalibrated models 11. Single-event hydrograph models A. Design storm B. Actual storm 111. Watershed (continuous) multiple-event models A. Actual record B. Synthetic record The peak discharge is a primary variable for the design of stormwater runoff facilities such as pipe systems, storm inlets and culverts, and small open channels. It is also used for some hydrologic planning such as small detention facilities in urban areas. It is an acceptable design variable for designs where the time variation of storage is not a primary factor in the runoff process. Where variation of storage is important, the design should be based on a hy- drograph procedure (see Chapter 9). As suggested, peak discharge models are just one group of hydrologic models. Other types of hydrologic models are used for other types of hydrologic design problems. Table 7-1 provides a classification system for hydrologic models, with the peak discharge models discussed in this chapter. Other types of hydrologic models of Table 7-1 will be discussed in other chapters. As shown in Table 7-1, peak discharge models can be separated into two groups: cali- brated and uncalibrated models. In a sense, all models are calibrated, so the difference sug- gested by the two groups of peak discharge models of Table 7-1 lies within the level of for- mality in the calibration. As used herein, the term calibrated models will be applied to models based on regressions involving peak discharges obtained from flood frequency analyses at gaged sites or the statistical moments of flood records. The term uncalibrated model will refer to models that have not undergone a formal fitting to gaged data. Whlle the line between the two is somewhat fuzzy, the distinction should be clear after examples are introduced in this chapter.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what is the significance of peak discharge?", "answer": "Peak discharge is a primary design variable for stormwater runoff facilities such as pipe systems, storm inlets and culverts, and small open channels, and it is also used for hydrologic planning like small detention facilities in urban areas."}, {"question": "How do calibrated and uncalibrated peak discharge models differ in terms of their development?", "answer": "Calibrated models are based on regressions involving peak discharges obtained from flood frequency analyses at gaged sites or the statistical moments of flood records, whereas uncalibrated models have not undergone a formal fitting to gaged data."}, {"question": "Why is peak discharge an acceptable design variable for certain types of hydrologic designs?", "answer": "Peak discharge is an acceptable design variable for designs where the time variation of storage is not a primary factor in the runoff process, as it provides a straightforward measure of the maximum water surface elevation during a storm event."}, {"question": "In what situations should hydrograph procedures be used instead of peak discharge models?", "answer": "Hydrograph procedures should be used where variation of storage is important, as peak discharge models do not account for the time variation of storage in the runoff process."}, {"question": "How do peak discharge models relate to other types of hydrologic models, and what are their limitations?", "answer": "Peak discharge models are just one group of hydrologic models, and they have limitations, such as not being suitable for designs where the time variation of storage is important.

The classification system for hydrologic models, as shown in Table 7-1, highlights the different types of models and their applications."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using uncalibrated peak discharge models, and how do they differ from calibrated models in practice?", "answer": "Uncalibrated peak discharge models have not undergone a formal fitting to gaged data, which may lead to less accurate predictions compared to calibrated models. In practice, uncalibrated models may be used when there is limited data available, but they should be used with caution. Calibrated models, on the other hand, are based on historical data and provide more reliable predictions. The distinction between calibrated and uncalibrated models is important, as it affects the accuracy and reliability of the predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of urban hydrology, why are peak discharge models important for designing stormwater runoff facilities?", "answer": "Peak discharge models are important for designing stormwater runoff facilities in urban areas because they provide a critical measure of the maximum water surface elevation during a storm event, which is essential for designing facilities such as pipe systems, storm inlets, and culverts. The accurate estimation of peak discharge is crucial for ensuring that these facilities can handle the maximum flow rates during storm events, thereby preventing flooding and damage to infrastructure."}, {"question": "How do the different types of hydrologic models, as classified in Table 7-1, address various hydrologic design problems?", "answer": "The different types of hydrologic models, as classified in Table 7-1, address various hydrologic design problems by providing a range of approaches to estimate peak discharge, simulate hydrographs, and model watershed behavior. For example, peak discharge models are suitable for designing stormwater runoff facilities, while watershed (continuous) multiple-event models are used for more complex hydrologic design problems that involve multiple storm events and varying watershed conditions. The classification system highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate model for the specific design problem, taking into account factors such as data availability, model complexity, and the level of accuracy required."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the time variation of storage in hydrologic design, and how do peak discharge models account for this factor?", "answer": "The time variation of storage is essential to consider in hydrologic design because it affects the runoff process and the behavior of stormwater runoff facilities. Peak discharge models do not explicitly account for the time variation of storage, which is why they are not suitable for designs where this factor is important. Instead, hydrograph procedures should be used, as they can simulate the time variation of storage and provide a more accurate representation of the runoff process."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic planning, how do peak discharge models contribute to the design of small detention facilities in urban areas?", "answer": "Peak discharge models contribute to the design of small detention facilities in urban areas by providing a critical measure of the maximum water surface elevation during a storm event. This information is essential for designing detention facilities that can effectively manage stormwater runoff and prevent flooding. The accurate estimation of peak discharge is crucial for ensuring that these facilities can handle the maximum flow rates during storm events, thereby protecting urban infrastructure and preventing damage to properties."}]}
{"paragraph": "7.2 HISTORICAL REVIEW Designs based on peak discharges have a long historical basis. In a historical review of the literature on engineering studies of hydrologic determination of waterway areas, Ven Te Chow (1962) included the following events: Sec. 7.2 Historical Review 361 1852: preparation of a table expressing the relation between the diameter and slope of a circular outlet sewer and the size of the drainage area. 1879: preparation of the Myers Formula; Major E.T.C. Myers was chief engineer of the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railway in Virginia. 1880: publication of the formula by the Swiss hydraulic engineer A. Burkli-Ziegler. 1887: publication of the Talbot Formula; Professor A.N. Talbot was from the University of Illinois. 1889: publication by Emil Kuichling of the Rational Method. These are just a few of the historical events relating to design methods using peak dis- charges. It is also of interest to note that J.C.I. Dooge (1973) credits T.J. Mulvaney with the development of the Rational method as early as 1851 in Ireland. While the Rational Method and some of the more recent methods will be discussed in detail, it may be of interest to review some of these older formulas. The change in the form of design methods over the last 100 years may seem surprisingly small. In 1879, Myers presented the following formula for computing the area of a waterway (A,, in square feet): in which C, is a coefficient that reflects the slope of the drainage area and A is the drainage area in acres. Use of the Myers Formula should be limited to small drainage areas. The area A, appears to be independent of land use and rainfall, although the rainfall intensity may be inherent in the coefficient C,. It was probably developed independent of land use since it was intended to be used by railroad engineers, and thus the land use would be typical of rail- way right-of-way areas. The Burkli-Ziegler Formula computes the unit discharge (ft3/sec/acre), q,, using in which Cb is a runoff coefficient for Equation 7-2; i is the average rainfall rate (in./hr) dur- ing the heaviest storm, S is the average ground slope (ftf1000 ft), and A is the drainage area in acres. The runoff coefficient, Cb, depended on the land cover, with special emphasis on the relative imperviousness. The Talbot Formula was intended for computing the waterway cross-sectional area (a, ft2). Talbot based his formula on the Burkli-Ziegler Formula, with the following result: 0 = C, ~ 0 . ~ 5 (7-3) Chow (1962) provided criteria for selecting values of the coefficient C,. These early attempts at hydrologic design suggest that the dominant factors in peak discharge estimation were recognized as the drainage area, land use, rainfall intensity, and slope. These same factors are at the heart of many of the equations used today. Current meth- ods attempt to develop more precise criteria for selecting values of the empirical coefficients and include additional variables as input. Although these additional variables are probably not as important as drainage area, land use, and rainfall, they should nevertheless improve the accuracy of prediction. 362 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of historical hydrologic design methods, what significant events occurred in the 19th century that contributed to the development of peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "Significant events include the preparation of a table relating outlet sewer diameter and slope to drainage area in 1852, the development of the Myers Formula in 1879, the publication of the Burkli-Ziegler Formula in 1880, and the publication of the Talbot Formula in 1887, all of which laid foundational elements for peak discharge estimation methods."}, {"question": "Why did the development of the Rational Method, credited to Emil Kuichling in 1889, mark an important milestone in hydrologic design?", "answer": "The Rational Method marked an important milestone because it provided a systematic approach to estimating peak discharges, considering factors such as drainage area, rainfall intensity, and runoff coefficients, which are still fundamental in current hydrologic design methods. This method's significance also lies in its adaptability and the fact that it was developed early on, with T.J. Mulvaney credited by J.C.I. Dooge with its development as early as 1851 in Ireland. The Rational Method's impact on the field is evident in its continued discussion and application alongside more recent methods, indicating its enduring relevance."}, {"question": "How do the Myers, Burkli-Ziegler, and Talbot Formulas differ in their approach to computing waterway areas or unit discharges?", "answer": "The Myers Formula computes the area of a waterway based on the drainage area and a coefficient reflecting the slope of the drainage area, without explicitly considering land use or rainfall intensity. In contrast, the Burkli-Ziegler Formula calculates the unit discharge, taking into account the average rainfall rate, ground slope, and a runoff coefficient that depends on land cover. The Talbot Formula, derived from the Burkli-Ziegler Formula, computes the waterway cross-sectional area, incorporating a coefficient that can be selected based on criteria provided by Ven Te Chow. These differences highlight the evolving understanding of hydrologic factors influencing peak discharge estimation."}, {"question": "In the context of peak discharge estimation, why are factors such as drainage area, land use, and rainfall intensity considered dominant?", "answer": "These factors are considered dominant because they directly influence the volume and rate of runoff, which in turn affect peak discharge. The drainage area determines the potential volume of runoff, land use influences the runoff coefficient due to variations in imperviousness and infiltration rates, and rainfall intensity affects the rate at which runoff is generated. The recognition of these factors in early design methods, such as the Burkli-Ziegler and Rational Methods, and their continued emphasis in current methods underscore their critical role in accurately estimating peak discharges."}, {"question": "How have current methods of peak discharge estimation evolved from the historical methods discussed?", "answer": "Current methods have evolved by attempting to develop more precise criteria for selecting empirical coefficients and by incorporating additional variables as input. While the fundamental factors of drainage area, land use, and rainfall intensity remain central, the inclusion of other variables aims to improve the accuracy of peak discharge predictions. This evolution reflects an ongoing effort to refine hydrologic design methods, acknowledging the complexity of hydrologic systems and the need for more sophisticated approaches to capture this complexity accurately."}, {"question": "What implications does the historical review of hydrologic design methods have for the development of future peak discharge estimation techniques?", "answer": "The historical review highlights the importance of understanding the evolution of hydrologic design methods and the factors that influence peak discharge estimation. It implies that future techniques should build upon the foundational knowledge established by early methods, such as the Rational Method and the formulas developed by Myers, Burkli-Ziegler, and Talbot. Furthermore, it suggests that continued refinement of empirical coefficients and the incorporation of additional relevant variables will be crucial for improving the accuracy and applicability of peak discharge estimation methods in diverse hydrologic contexts."}, {"question": "In the context of the Rational Method, how does the land use factor influence the estimation of peak discharges?", "answer": "The land use factor influences the estimation of peak discharges through the runoff coefficient, which depends on the relative imperviousness of the land cover. Different land uses have different runoff coefficients, reflecting variations in how much rainfall becomes runoff versus infiltration. This consideration is crucial because it directly affects the volume and rate of runoff, thereby impacting the estimated peak discharge. The method's adaptability to different land uses makes it versatile for application in various hydrologic settings."}, {"question": "Why is it important to limit the use of the Myers Formula to small drainage areas?", "answer": "The Myers Formula should be limited to small drainage areas because it does not explicitly account for land use or rainfall intensity, factors that become increasingly significant in larger drainage areas. The formula's simplicity, while useful for small areas, may not capture the complexity of hydrologic processes in larger areas, potentially leading to less accurate peak discharge estimates. This limitation underscores the need for more comprehensive methods, like the"}]}
{"paragraph": "7.3 SINGLE-RETURN-PERIOD EQUATIONS Hydrologic design engineers would like to have a 50-yr flood record available at every site where a peak discharge estimate is needed for design work. If such data were always avail- able, then a frequency analysis of the flood record (see Chapter 5) could be used to character- ize the flood potential at the site of the design work. Unfortunately, flood records are rarely available where peak discharge estimates are needed for design work. Therefore, it is neces- sary to use either a prediction method that was developed from flood frequency analyses of gaged data in the region or an uncalibrated prediction equation that was designed for use at ungaged sites. Stream gages are usually located at locations that receive runoff from large water- sheds. Therefore, prediction equations based on the regional analysis of flood frequency re- sults are most appropriate for larger drainage areas. Their use for design on small areas of about 100 acres or less may represent extrapolation rather than interpolation, and thus, the accuracy of estimated values would seem to be less than that for the watersheds similar in size and physiohydrologic characteristics to the watersheds used in developing the equations. For the smaller watersheds, one of the uncalibrated methods is usually applied primarily be- cause of their simplicity in contrast to their expected accuracy. The classification scheme of Table 7-1 includes three types of peak discharge models under the heading \"calibrated models.\" For lack of a better description, the first of the three was called single-return-period equations. This type of model relates the peak discharge of a specific return period to one or more watershed andlor meteorological characteristics. It is quite common to calibrate these using a multiple linear regression analysis after malung a logarithmic transform of all the variables. Stepwise regression is frequently used to decide which predictor or independent variables to use. Before providing examples of the single- return-period equations, it may be instructive to discuss the problem in ternls of the concepts of analysis and synthesis.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why is it desirable to have a 50-yr flood record available at every site where a peak discharge estimate is needed for design work?", "answer": "It is desirable to have a 50-yr flood record available because it allows for a frequency analysis of the flood record, which can be used to characterize the flood potential at the site of the design work. This is crucial for accurate design and planning. Without such data, engineers must rely on prediction methods or uncalibrated prediction equations, which may not be as accurate."}, {"question": "How do hydrologic design engineers typically approach peak discharge estimation when flood records are not available at the site of interest?", "answer": "When flood records are not available, hydrologic design engineers use either a prediction method developed from flood frequency analyses of gaged data in the region or an uncalibrated prediction equation designed for use at ungaged sites. The choice between these methods depends on the size and characteristics of the watershed."}, {"question": "In the context of stream gages, what is the primary limitation of using prediction equations based on regional analysis of flood frequency results for design work on small areas?", "answer": "The primary limitation is that these equations are most appropriate for larger drainage areas, and their use for design on small areas (about 100 acres or less) may represent extrapolation rather than interpolation, leading to potentially less accurate estimated values. This is because the equations were developed based on data from larger watersheds, which may not accurately represent the hydrologic characteristics of smaller watersheds."}, {"question": "Why are uncalibrated methods often preferred for peak discharge estimation on smaller watersheds, despite their potentially lower accuracy?", "answer": "Uncalibrated methods are often preferred for smaller watersheds because of their simplicity, which contrasts with their expected accuracy. This simplicity makes them more practical for use in situations where the availability of data and resources may be limited."}, {"question": "In the context of single-return-period equations, how are these models typically calibrated, and what statistical technique is commonly used to select predictor variables?", "answer": "Single-return-period equations are typically calibrated using a multiple linear regression analysis after making a logarithmic transform of all the variables. Stepwise regression is frequently used to decide which predictor or independent variables to use. This approach allows for the identification of the most significant variables that influence peak discharge and helps in developing a robust model."}, {"question": "What is the underlying concept behind single-return-period equations, and how do they relate to watershed and meteorological characteristics?", "answer": "Single-return-period equations relate the peak discharge of a specific return period to one or more watershed and/or meteorological characteristics. This type of model is based on the idea that peak discharge can be predicted by understanding the relationships between these characteristics and the flood behavior of the watershed. By analyzing these relationships, engineers can develop equations that estimate peak discharge for different return periods, which is essential for design and planning purposes."}, {"question": "How do the limitations of prediction equations and uncalibrated methods impact the accuracy of peak discharge estimates, especially for smaller watersheds?", "answer": "The limitations of prediction equations and uncalibrated methods can significantly impact the accuracy of peak discharge estimates, particularly for smaller watersheds. The use of equations developed for larger watersheds on smaller areas can lead to extrapolation errors, while uncalibrated methods, although simple, may not capture the complex hydrologic processes at play. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the methods used and the potential for errors in peak discharge estimation, especially in data-scarce or resource-limited situations."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what are the implications of not having sufficient flood record data for peak discharge estimation, and how do engineers address this challenge?", "answer": "The lack of sufficient flood record data for peak discharge estimation poses significant challenges for hydrologic design, as it necessitates the use of less accurate prediction methods or uncalibrated equations. To address this challenge, engineers rely on regional analyses, uncalibrated methods, and the development of new prediction equations that can be applied to ungaged sites. This underscores the importance of continued data collection and research into improving peak discharge estimation methods, especially for smaller and ungaged watersheds."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the size and physiohydrologic characteristics of watersheds when selecting a method for peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "Considering the size and physiohydrologic characteristics of watersheds is crucial because different methods are more suitable for different types of watersheds. For example, prediction equations based on regional analysis are more appropriate for larger watersheds, while uncalibrated methods might be more suitable for smaller watersheds. Ignoring these factors can lead to the use of inappropriate methods, resulting in less accurate peak discharge estimates and potentially inadequate design and planning."}]}
{"paragraph": "7.3.1 Analysis Since the form of Equation 2-1 13 is used most often, the objective of the analysis process is to select the predictor variables to use in the following equation and calculate the values of the regression coefficients b, ( j= 0, 1,2, ..., p): in which q, is the peak discharge and X, ( j = 1, 2, ..., p) are the watershed characteristics. Note that the subscript p on q indicates 'peak' while the random variable p denotes the num- ber of predictor variables in the equation. The model is calibrated using data from water- sheds in a reasonably homogeneous region. The steps of the analysis procedure are as fol- lows: 1. Obtain the annual maximum flood series for each of the n gaged sites in the region. 2. Perform a separate flood frequency analysis (for example, log-Pearson Type 111) on each of the flood series of Step 1 and determine the peak discharges for selected return See. 7.3 Single-Return-Period Equations 363 periods (for example, the 2-, 5-, lo-, 25-, 50-, and 100-yr discharges are commonly se- lected). 3. Determine the values of watershed and meteorological characteristics for each water- shed for which a flood series was collected in Step 1. Form an (nx p) data matrix of all the data, where n is the number of flood series (watersheds) of Step 1, and p is the number of watershed characteristics obtained. 4. Form a one-dimensional array of the n peak discharges for the specific return period. 5. Regress the array of n peak discharges of Step 4 on the data matrix of Step 3 to obtain the prediction equation. Peak discharge estimates made with the resulting equation are for the return period selected in Step 2. If more than one return period is of interest, the procedure can be repeated for each re- turn period, with a separate equation developed for each. In this case, it is also important to review closely the resulting coefficients to ensure that they are consistent across the various return periods. Because of sampling variation it is possible for the regression analyses to produce a set of coefficients that, under certain sets of values for the predictor variables, the 10-yr estimated discharge may, for example, be greater than the computed 25-yr discharge. The coefficients should be adjusted to ensure that this does not occur. One method of smoothing the coefficients is to plot them versus return period and draw a smooth curve through the points. Then, instead of using the actual coefficient, the value for each return pe- riod should be taken from the fitted curve and used for the final equations. Example 7-1 Table 7-2 contains the data matrix for developing a single-return-period peak discharge equa- tion. Annual maximum flood series were obtained for 58 gaged sites in Indiana (Davis, 1974). Each series was subjected to a flood frequency analysis from which the 10-yr peak discharge was obtained; the 10-yr peak for each gaged site is also given in Table 7-2 and denoted as qp. Seven watershed characteristics were measured for each of the 58 sites; the data matrix, 58 by 7, is also given in Table 7-2. This matrix and the vector of peak discharge values represents the first four steps of the analysis process described previously. The vector of peaks was regressed on the matrix of watershed characteristics after taking the natural logarithms of the data. The fol- lowing equation resulted: Equation 7-5 resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.955 and a sum of the errors equal to zero, both of which apply only to the accuracy of estimating In qp.E quation 7-5 was transformed to the following form: The average error (that is, - qp)f or the 58 peak discharges for Equation 7-6 is -215 ffJlsec, which indicates a small bias. The correlation coefficient computed for Equation 7-5 cannot be used as a measure of accuracy of estimates made with Equation 7-6. The development of Equa- tion 7-6 represents the last step of the analysis process. 364 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 TABLE 7-2 Data Matrix for Indiana Flood Data ~ e c7.. 3 Single-Return-Period Equations 365 - XI: drainage area (mi2) X,: channel slope (ftlmi); the difference in elevation at points 10% and 85% of the distance along the channel from a gaging station to the watershed divide, divided by the distance between the two points X3: channel length (mi); distance along a stream from a point of discharge to the watershed divide X,: precipitation index (in.); mean annual precipitation minus the sum of average annual evapotranspiration and mean annual snowfall (water equivalent) X5: basin relief (ft.); the difference in elevation between the highest point on the watershed perimeter and the stream at the point of discharge X,: drainage density (dmi2);t otal length of streams in a watershed divided by the drainage area X,: soil runoff coefficient; ratio of the volume of rainfall to the total volume of runoff occurring after the beginning of runoff Y: instantaneous peak discharge (ft3/sec) for a 10-yr exceedence frequency Source: L.

Example 7-2 Table 7-3 contains an abbreviated data set from a larger data base. The data matrix includes four predictor variables and three criterion variables, with data for fifteen gaging stations. A correla- tion analysis between the logarithms of the predictor variables and the logarithms of each of the criterion variables is given in Table 74a. Except for the correlation between slope and rainfall, -0.80, the correlations between the predictor variables are small; this suggests that three of the four variables will be needed. For all three criterion variables, the drainage area has the highest correlation, followed by rainfall, forest cover, and slope. Very little variation in the rainfall depths exists (column 4 of Table 7-3), with values ranging from 2.75 to 3.75 in. It is important to note that the correlations between rainfall depth and the three peak discharges are all negative, which is irrational; one would expect a positive correlation between rainfall and runoff. The irrational corre- lation is due to the small variation in rainfall, which causes it to appear as an unimportant variable. A stepwise regression analysis (see Chapter 2) was performed for each of the three crite- rion variables on all four of the predictor variables. The model of Equation 7 4 w as fitted after taking logarithms of the data. The results are given in Table 74b. In each case, rainfall was not significant, statistically or physically, and so it does not appear in the final equations. All of the equations produce accurate predictions with R ' values above 0.8 and SkS, values less than 0.5. All of the equations are biased, although the biases are less than 10 percent of the mean values of the peak discharges. All of the total F values are statistically significant.

However, it is crucial to review the resulting coefficients closely to ensure they are consistent across the various return periods. If inconsistencies arise, such as a 10-yr estimated discharge being greater than a 25-yr discharge, the coefficients should be adjusted. One method for smoothing the coefficients involves plotting them versus return period and drawing a smooth curve through the points, then using the values from the fitted curve for the final equations."}, {"question": "Why might the correlation between rainfall depth and peak discharges appear irrational in certain analyses?", "answer": "The correlation between rainfall depth and peak discharges might appear irrational, such as being negative when a positive correlation is expected, due to the small variation in rainfall depths. This small variation can cause rainfall to appear as an unimportant variable, leading to irrational correlations. It is essential to consider the range and variability of the data when interpreting correlation results to avoid misinterpreting the relationships between variables."}, {"question": "In the context of stepwise regression analysis for peak discharge estimation, how are the predictor variables selected?", "answer": "In stepwise regression analysis, the predictor variables are selected based on their significance, both statistically and physically. Variables that are not significant are excluded from the final equations. For example, in the analysis described, rainfall was not significant and did not appear in the final equations, despite its expected positive relationship with peak discharges, due to its small variation and lack of statistical significance."}, {"question": "What implications does the smoothing of regression coefficients have for ensuring consistent peak discharge estimates across different return periods?", "answer": "Smoothing the regression coefficients is crucial for ensuring that the computed peak discharges are consistent across return periods. Without smoothing, the coefficients might produce estimates where, for instance, the 10-yr discharge is greater than the 25-yr discharge, which is physically inconsistent. By adjusting the coefficients to follow a logical trend with return period, the resulting equations provide more reliable and consistent estimates of peak discharges for different return periods, enhancing the accuracy and usability of the peak discharge estimation model."}, {"question": "How do the values of regression coefficients change with the return period in peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "The values of the regression coefficients decrease in magnitude as the return period increases. This trend is observed in the results of the stepwise regression analysis, where the coefficients for drainage area, channel slope, and forest cover decrease as the return period increases from 2 to 100 years. This change reflects the complex relationships between watershed characteristics, rainfall, and peak discharge, and how these relationships may vary with the severity of the flood event."}, {"question": "In the context of peak discharge estimation, why is it important to consider the physical significance of predictor variables alongside their statistical significance?", "answer": "Considering the physical significance of predictor variables is important because statistical significance alone may not capture the actual relationships between variables. For example, rainfall is expected to have a positive relationship with peak discharges, but if its variation is small, it might not be statistically significant. By evaluating both statistical and physical significance, the model can better represent the underlying hydrological processes, leading to more accurate and reliable peak discharge estimates."}, {"question": "What challenges might arise when interpreting the results of correlation analyses between predictor variables and peak discharges?", "answer": "Challenges might arise when interpreting correlation results due to the potential for small variations in certain variables to lead to irrational or unexpected correlations. For instance, a variable with a small range of values might appear unimportant or even negatively correlated with peak discharge, despite a physically expected positive relationship. It is crucial to consider the data's variability and range when interpreting correlations to avoid misinterpreting the relationships between variables and to ensure that the selected predictor variables accurately represent the hydrological processes involved in peak discharge estimation."}, {"question": "How does the development of a single-return-period peak discharge equation involve transforming the initial equation?", "answer": "The development of a single-return-period peak discharge equation involves transforming the initial equation, such as from a logarithmic form to a linear form, to obtain the final prediction equation. This transformation is necessary to express the peak discharge in its original units, making the equation usable for practical applications. The transformation process must ensure that the resulting equation maintains the accuracy and reliability of the initial equation, with considerations for potential biases and errors introduced during the transformation."}, {"question": "What role does the drainage area play in peak discharge estimation, as indicated by the correlation analysis?", "answer": "The drainage area plays a significant role in peak discharge estimation, as it has the highest correlation with"}]}
{"paragraph": "7.3.2 Synthesis Once the regression equation has been calibrated, it can be used to predict peak discharges for the specified return period. Values for the watershed characteristics used as predictor variables must be obtained for the watershed where a design is to be made.

{"paragraph": "7.3.3 USGS Urban Peak Discharge Formulas Sauer et al. (1981) used 269 urban watersheds to develop regression equations for water- sheds having at least 15% of the drainage area covered by residential, commercial, or indus- trial development. None of the gaged sites had undergone a change in development of more than 50% during the period of record that was used to develop the set of single-return-period regression equations (Table 7-5). The rural discharge can be obtained from USGS reports for the location where the urban peak discharge estimate is required. An equation such as Equation 7-6 is available for most locations in the United States. Sauer et al. (1981) define the basin development factor as follows: The most significant index of urbanization was a basin development factor (BDF) which pro- vides a measure of the efficiency of the drainage system. This parameter, which proved to be highly significant in the regression equations, can be easily determined from drainage maps and field inspections of the drainage basin. The basin is first subdivided into thirds and within each third, four aspects of the drainage system are evaluated and assigned a code as follows: 1. Channel improvements. If channel improvements such as straightening, enlarging, deep- ening, and clearing are prevalent for the main drainage channel and principal tributaries (those that drain directly into the main channel), then a code of one (1) is assigned.

To be considered prevalent, at least 50 percent of the main drainage channel and principal tributaries must be improved to some extent over natural conditions. If channel improvements are not prevalent, then a code of zero (0) is assigned. 2. Channel linings. If more than 50 percent of the main drainage channel and principal trib- utaries have been lined with an impervious material, such as concrete, then a code of one (I) is assigned. If less than 50 percent of these channels are lined, then a code of zero (0) is assigned. The presence of channel linings would probably indicate the presence of channel improvements as well. Therefore, this is an added factor and indicates a more highly developed drainage system. 3. Storm drains or storm sewers. Storm drains are defined as enclosed drainage structures (usually pipes), frequently used on the secondary tributaries where the drainage is re- ceived directly from streets or parking lots. Quite often these drains empty into the main tributaries and channel that are either open channels, or in some basins may be enclosed as box or pipe culverts. When more than 50 percent of the secondary tributaries within a section consists of storm drains, then a code of one (1) is assigned, and conversely if less than 50 percent of the secondary tributaries consists of storm drains, then a code of Sec. 7.3 Single-Return-Period Equations TABLE 7-6 Minimum and Maximum Values of Predictor Variables Used to Calibrate Equations of Table 7-5 Variable Minimum Maximum Units A 0.2 100 square miles SL 3.0 7 0\" feet per mile R12 0.2 2.8 inches ST 0 11 percent BDF 0 12 - ZA 3.0 50 percent LT 0.2 45 hours \"Maximum value of slope for use in equations is 70 ftlrni, although numer- ous watersheds used in this study had SL values up to 500 ftlmi. zero (0) is assigned. It should be noted that if 50 percent or more of the main drainage channels and principal tributaries are enclosed, then the aspects of channel improvements and channel linings would also be assigned a code of one (1). 4. Curb and gutter streets. If more than 50 percent of a subarea is urbanized (covered by residential, commercial, andlor industrial development), and if more than 50 percent of the streets and highways in the subarea is constructed with curbs and gutters, then a code of one (1) should be assigned. Otherwise, a code of zero (0) is assigned. Frequently, drainage from curb-and-gutter streets will empty into storm drains. The above guidelines for determining the various drainage system codes are not in- tended to be precise measurements. A certain amount of subjectivity is involved. It is recom- mended that field checking be performed to obtain the best estimate. The basin development factor (BDF) is computed as the sum of the assigned codes. Obviously, with three subareas per basin, and four drainage aspects to which codes are assigned in each subarea, the maxi- mum value for a fully developed drainage system would be 12. Conversely, if the drainage system has not been developed, then a BDF of zero (0)w ould result. Such a condition does not necessarily mean that the basin is unaffected by urbanization. In fact, a basin could be partially urbanized, have some impervious area, and have some improvements to secondary tributaries, and still have an assigned BDF of zero (0). The range of the data used to develop the urban equations of Table 7-5 are given in Table 7-6. TABLE 7-7 Peak Discharges for Rural Conditions, Current Urban Conditions, and Future Urban Conditions Urban Peaks Return Rural Period Peaks 1986 201 1 ( ~ r ) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) 370 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 Example 7 4 To illustrate the use of the single-return-period equations of Table 7-5, assume that the rural peak discharges (RQ in ft3/sec) were computed from the USGS rural area equations for the de- sign location; the values of RQ are given in Table 7-7. The watershed has an area of 12 mi2, a slope of 42 ftlrni, and a 2-yr, 2-hr rainfall of 1.6 in. In its current state (1986) the watershed stor- age is 3%, the basin development factor equals 3, and the imperviousness is 13%. It is also of in- terest to project the effects of planned developments to the year 201 1. In the 25-yr zoning plan, the storage will increase to 5%, the imperviousness to 25%, and the basin development factor to 9 (see Table 7-8). Based on these characteristics and the rural peak discharges, the seven- parameter urban peak discharge equations of Table 7-5 were used to compute the peak discharges for the current levels of urban development and the levels that will exist in 201 1. These dis- charges are given in Table 7-7. For the smaller return periods, the urban peaks are much greater than the rural peak discharges; the current 2-yr urban peak is 24% greater than the 2-yr rural peak discharge. For the larger return periods, the differences in percent are smaller, and the computed 100-yr urban peak for current conditions is actually smaller than the rural peak. Although this is not rational, the difference of 40 f$/sec is certainly not significant and is only indicative of the problem in using regression equations. Since all regression equations are less than 100% accu- rate, values that are somewhat irrational should be expected on occasion. The fact that the upper end of the rural flood frequency curve approaches the upper end of the urban curve is rational be- cause we would expect the watershed to be saturated during large storms such as the 100-yr event; thus the saturated rural watershed would respond in much the same way as the impervious watershed. This is especially true for watersheds that have small percentages of imperviousness, such as the watershed of this example in the current urban condition with IA equal to 13%.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of urban peak discharge estimation, what is the significance of the basin development factor (BDF) in the USGS urban peak discharge formulas?", "answer": "The basin development factor (BDF) is a measure of the efficiency of the drainage system and is highly significant in the regression equations. It is determined by evaluating four aspects of the drainage system in each third of the basin, including channel improvements, channel linings, storm drains or storm sewers, and curb and gutter streets, and assigning a code based on the prevalence of these features. The BDF provides a way to quantify the impact of urbanization on the drainage system and is used in conjunction with other factors such as drainage area, basin rainfall intensity, and rural peak discharge to estimate urban peak discharges."}, {"question": "How do the USGS urban peak discharge formulas account for the effects of urbanization on peak discharge, and what are the implications of these effects?", "answer": "The USGS urban peak discharge formulas account for the effects of urbanization by incorporating the basin development factor (BDF) and impervious cover (IA) into the regression equations. As urbanization increases, the BDF and IA also increase, leading to higher peak discharges. However, the formulas also show that for larger return periods, the differences between urban and rural peak discharges decrease, and in some cases, the urban peak discharge may even be smaller than the rural peak discharge. This suggests that the impact of urbanization on peak discharge is more significant for smaller storms, and that the watershed's response to large storms may be less affected by urbanization."}, {"question": "In the context of the example provided, why does the 100-yr urban peak discharge for current conditions appear to be smaller than the rural peak discharge, and what does this imply about the limitations of the regression equations?", "answer": "The 100-yr urban peak discharge for current conditions appears to be smaller than the rural peak discharge because the regression equations are not 100% accurate, and the difference is not significant. This implies that the equations may not always capture the complex relationships between urbanization, drainage system efficiency, and peak discharge, especially for larger return periods. The fact that the upper end of the rural flood frequency curve approaches the upper end of the urban curve suggests that the watershed's response to large storms may be less affected by urbanization, and that the equations may be more reliable for smaller return periods."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the single-return-period equations of Table 7-5, and how are they used to estimate urban peak discharges?", "answer": "The single-return-period equations of Table 7-5 are used to estimate urban peak discharges for a given return period, taking into account factors such as drainage area, basin rainfall intensity, rural peak discharge, and basin development factor.

A BDF of zero does not necessarily mean that the basin is unaffected by urbanization, but rather that the drainage system has not been significantly developed. This implies that a basin can be partially urbanized and have some impervious area, but still have a BDF of zero, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing the impacts of urbanization on peak discharge."}, {"question": "In the context of urban peak discharge estimation, why is it important to consider the drainage area, basin rainfall intensity, and rural peak discharge in conjunction with the basin development factor?", "answer": "It is important to consider the drainage area, basin rainfall intensity, and rural peak discharge in conjunction with the basin development factor because these factors interact with the BDF to affect peak discharge. The drainage area and basin rainfall intensity influence the amount of runoff generated, while the rural peak discharge provides a baseline for the peak discharge that would occur in the absence of urbanization.

{"paragraph": "7.4 INDEX-FLOOD ESTIMATION Two potential problems arise when adopting the single-return-period equation. First, calibra- tion is quite involved because a separate equation must be fit for each return period. This re- quires evaluation of six equations when developing a frequency curve. Second, because of random variation, the fitted coefficients may show irrational variation that potentially could yield irrational estimates. This problem is avoided by proper smoothing of the coefficients. In spite of these problems, the single-return-period method is widely used. The index-flood method avoids these problems associated with the single-return- period-equations method. Simply stated, the index-flood approach has two basic compo- nents: a prediction equation for one return period and a set of multipliers to be used for the other return periods. For example, we may define the 2-yr flood to be the index flood, with the Rational Method used to compute the flood.

More accurate flood estimates can lead to better-informed decisions regarding infrastructure design, flood protection measures, and emergency response planning. Conversely, less accurate estimates may result in under or over-preparation for flood events, potentially leading to increased risks and costs.

To use the index-flood method for an ungaged watershed with a drainage area of 45 sq. mi, a channel slope of 62 ftlmile, and a 31% forest cover, the index equation yields a 2-yr peak discharge of Therefore, the 10- and 100-yr discharges are q,, = 1.994q2 = 5,779 ft3/sec q,, = 4.013q2 = 11,630 ft 3/sec These values could be used to plot a flood frequency curve. Sec. 7.4 Index-Flood Estimation Example 7-6 Trent (1978) used the 10-yr peak discharge as the index flood from small rural watersheds: in which A is the drainage area, R is an isoerodent factor, defined as the mean annual rainfall ki- netic energy times the annual maximum 30-min rainfall intensity (in., hr), and DH is the differ- ence (ft) of the elevation of the main channel between the most distant point on the watershed boundary and the design point. The coefficients bi (i = 1,2,3) are a function of the hydrophysio- graphic zone. The estimated peak discharge must be modified when the surface water storage in lakes, swamps, and ponds exceeds 4%. The 2-yr peak discharge is estimated by multiplying the 10-yr peak (q,,) by the index ratio of 0.41. The 100-yr peak (q,,) can be estimated by In this case, the form of Equation 7-8 was used for finding the 2-yr event from the index flood, which had a return period of 10 yr, but the 100-yr event used a slightly more complex form. Equa- tion 7-10 could be calibrated using least squares with a logarithmic transformation of the data. Example 7-7 Golden (1973) used the index-flood approach for estimating the magnitude of floods in Georgia. A preliminary analysis suggested that the state had to be divided into three regions: Region 1: The valley and ridge province, Blue Ridge province, and a small part of the Piedmont province Region 2: Piedmont province except for that small part in region 1 Region 3: Coastal plain Golden selected the 2-yr event as the index flood and developed the following index-flood equa- tions: Region 1: qp = 11 8 0 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ . ~ ~ Region 2: qp = 2 0 2 ~ ' ~ Region 3: qp = 2 . 6 5 ~ ~ . ~ ~ ~ ~ . ~ ~ in which qp is the 2-yr discharge (ft3/sec),A is the drainage area (mi2),S is the soil infiltration ca- pacity from the SCS method (in.), and P is the 2-yr, 24-hr rainfall (in.). The following set of index ratios were calibrated from the lo-, 25, and 50-yr flood events: Region k ~ o k ~ 5 k50 The flood frequency curve for a 10-mi2 watershed in region 2 can be determined from Equation 7-12: Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 Thus, the lo-, 25, and 50-yr peak discharges are 1649, 213 1, and 2413 ft3/sec, respec- tively:", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the index-flood method, what are the key components required to estimate the flood frequency curve?", "answer": "The key components required to estimate the flood frequency curve using the index-flood method are the index-flood equation and the index ratios.

{"paragraph": "7.6.1 Procedure The most widely used uncalibrated equation is the Rational Method. Mathematically, the Ra- tional Method relates the peak discharge (q,, ft3/sec) to the drainage area (A, acres), the rain- fall intensity (i, in./hr), and the runoff coefficient (C): The rainfall intensity is obtained from an intensity-duration-frequency curve (see Figure 4-4) using both the return period and a duration equal to the time of concentration as input. The value of the runoff coefficient is a function of the land use, cover condition, soil group, and watershed slope. Table 7-9 is an example of a table of C values; however, many other tables are in use. For example, Table 7-10 is a commonly used summary of C values.

This can lead to inconsistency in application. As a general rule, the mean of the range should be used unless a different value can be fully justified. It would be improper for a low value to be selected to reduce the size and therefore the cost of the drainage system. A primary use of the Rational Method has been for design problems for small urban areas such as the sizing of inlets and culverts, which are characterized by small drainage areas and short times of concentration. For such designs, short-duration storms are critical, which is why the time of concentration is used as the input duration for obtaining i from the intensity- duration-frequency curve. If the storm duration occurs at a constant rate i and uniformly over the entire watershed, the volume of rainfall would equal iAt,, which would have units of acre-inches Set. 7.6 Rational Method TABLE 7-1 0 Runoff Coefficients for the Rational Method Range of Recommended Description of Area Runoff Coefficients Value* Business Downtown Neighborhood Residential Single-family Multiunits, detached Multiunits, attached Residential (suburban) Apartment Industrial Light Heavy Parks, cemeteries Playgrounds Railroad yard Unimproved It is often desirable to develop a composite runoff coefficient based on the percentage of different types of sur- face in the drainage area.

Therefore, the design discharge is Some drainage policies provide for a minimum time of concentration with 15 to 20 min often being specified. If the design above were for a project where the minimum 1, was 15 min, the de- sign intensity would be 6.5 in./hr and the peak discharge would be 15 ft3/sec.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the Rational Method for peak discharge estimation, what are the key factors that influence the runoff coefficient?", "answer": "The runoff coefficient is influenced by land use, cover condition, soil group, and watershed slope. These factors are crucial in determining the appropriate value of the runoff coefficient, which can vary significantly depending on the specific characteristics of the drainage area. For instance, different land uses such as cultivated land, pasture, and residential areas have distinct runoff coefficients due to variations in surface characteristics and infiltration rates."}, {"question": "How does the selection of a low runoff coefficient value impact the design of drainage systems, and why is it considered improper?", "answer": "Selecting a low runoff coefficient value can lead to underestimation of peak discharge, resulting in the design of smaller and potentially inadequate drainage systems. This is considered improper because it may compromise the system's ability to handle stormwater runoff, leading to increased risk of flooding and other hydrological issues. The use of a low runoff coefficient without proper justification can have significant implications for the safety and effectiveness of drainage infrastructure."}, {"question": "In the context of storm recurrence intervals, why do less frequent, higher intensity storms require the use of higher runoff coefficients?", "answer": "Less frequent, higher intensity storms require higher runoff coefficients because infiltration and other losses have a proportionally smaller effect on runoff. During such events, the rainfall intensity is higher, and the soil has less time to infiltrate the water, resulting in a greater proportion of the rainfall becoming runoff. This necessitates the use of higher runoff coefficients to accurately estimate peak discharge and design adequate drainage systems."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of developing a composite runoff coefficient based on the percentage of different types of surfaces in the drainage area?", "answer": "The purpose of developing a composite runoff coefficient is to account for the varying surface characteristics within the drainage area, such as pavement, lawns, and roofs, which have different runoff coefficients. By considering the proportion of each surface type, a more accurate estimate of the overall runoff coefficient can be obtained, allowing for better design and management of drainage systems."}, {"question": "How does the time of concentration impact the design discharge in the Rational Method, and what are the implications of specifying a minimum time of concentration?", "answer": "The time of concentration is a critical factor in determining the design discharge, as it influences the rainfall intensity used in the calculation. Specifying a minimum time of concentration, such as 15-20 minutes, can impact the design discharge by altering the rainfall intensity and subsequent peak discharge estimate. This can have significant implications for drainage system design, as it may result in larger or smaller systems depending on the specified minimum time of concentration."}, {"question": "In the context of the Rational Method, what is the relationship between rainfall intensity, drainage area, and peak discharge?", "answer": "The Rational Method relates the peak discharge to the drainage area, rainfall intensity, and runoff coefficient. The rainfall intensity is obtained from an intensity-duration-frequency curve, and the runoff coefficient is a function of land use, cover condition, soil group, and watershed slope. The peak discharge is calculated by multiplying the rainfall intensity, drainage area, and runoff coefficient, providing a direct relationship between these factors."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the land use and cover condition when estimating the runoff coefficient in the Rational Method?", "answer": "Considering the land use and cover condition is essential because these factors significantly influence the runoff coefficient. Different land uses and cover conditions have distinct surface characteristics, infiltration rates, and runoff patterns, which affect the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff. Accurately accounting for these factors is crucial for obtaining a reliable estimate of the runoff coefficient and, subsequently, the peak discharge."}, {"question": "How do the coefficients in Table 7-9 and Table 7-10 differ, and what are the implications of using these tables for runoff coefficient estimation?", "answer": "The coefficients in Table 7-9 and Table 7-10 differ in their presentation and application. Table 7-9 provides runoff coefficients based on hydrologic soil group and slope range, while Table 7-10 offers a summary of runoff coefficients for various land uses. The use of these tables can lead to inconsistency in application, as each land use is associated with a range of values. It is recommended to use the mean of the range unless a different value can be fully justified, to ensure consistency and accuracy in runoff coefficient estimation."}, {"question": "In the context of drainage system design, what are the implications of using the Rational Method for peak discharge estimation, and how does it impact the sizing of inlets and culverts?", "answer": "The Rational Method is widely used for design problems in small urban areas, such as sizing inlets and culverts, due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The method provides a reliable estimate of peak discharge, which is essential for designing adequate drainage systems. However, the accuracy of the method depends on the accurate estimation of the runoff coefficient, rainfall intensity, and time of concentration."}]}
{"paragraph": "7.6.2 Runoff Coefficients for Nonhomogeneous Areas The runoff coefficients of Table 7-9 reflect the effects of land use, soil, and slope on runoff potential. The use of Equation 7-20 assumes that the watershed is homogeneous in these characteristics so that the runoff coefficient used provides unbiased estimates. Where a drainage area is characterized by distinct subareas that have different runoff potentials, the watershed should be subdivided and the equation applied separately to each area; the proce- dure for this is discussed in Section 7.6.3. Where a watershed is not homogeneous but is characterized by highly dispersed areas that can be characterized by different runoff coeffi- cients, a weighted runoff coefficient should be determined. The weighting is based on the area of each land use and is found by the following equation: in which Aj is the area for land cover j, Cji s the runoff coefficient for area j, n is the number of distinct land covers within the watershed, and C, is the weighted runoff coefficient. The weighted coefficient can be used with Equation 7-20. The denominator of Equation 7-22 equals the total drainage area, so Equation 7-22 can be substituted into Equation 7-20, which yields the following: n Example 7-10 Equation 7-23 will be illustrated using the data of Table 7-1 1. It is assumed that the different land uses are scattered throughout the watershed, and therefore it is impractical to subdivide the watershed.

This relationship ensures that the weighted coefficient accurately represents the overall runoff potential of the watershed."}, {"question": "Why is it impractical to subdivide a watershed in certain scenarios, and what alternative approach is used instead?", "answer": "It is impractical to subdivide a watershed when the different land uses are scattered throughout the area, making it difficult to delineate distinct subareas. In such cases, a weighted runoff coefficient is calculated using Equation 7-22, which provides a practical alternative for estimating peak discharge without the need for subdivision."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what is the significance of using a weighted runoff coefficient in Equation 7-23?", "answer": "The use of a weighted runoff coefficient in Equation 7-23 allows for a more accurate estimation of peak discharge by accounting for the spatial variability of runoff potentials within the watershed. This approach is particularly useful when the watershed exhibits a complex mix of land uses, soils, and slopes, and provides a more nuanced understanding of the hydrological processes at play. By incorporating the weighted coefficient, Equation 7-23 can provide estimates of peak discharge that are more representative of the actual hydrological conditions, which is crucial for the design and management of drainage infrastructure."}, {"question": "How does the calculation of a weighted runoff coefficient using Equation 7-22 facilitate the application of Equation 7-20 for peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "The calculation of a weighted runoff coefficient using Equation 7-22 facilitates the application of Equation 7-20 by providing a single, representative value that accounts for the varying runoff potentials across the watershed. This weighted coefficient can be directly substituted into Equation 7-20, streamlining the estimation of peak discharge and eliminating the need for complex watershed subdivision or separate calculations for each land use. By simplifying the application of Equation 7-20, the use of a weighted runoff coefficient promotes more efficient and accurate hydrological modeling."}, {"question": "What are the challenges associated with estimating runoff coefficients for watersheds with highly dispersed land uses, and how can these challenges be addressed?", "answer": "The challenges associated with estimating runoff coefficients for watersheds with highly dispersed land uses include the difficulty of subdividing the watershed into distinct subareas and the potential for biased estimates if the heterogeneity of the area is not accounted for. These challenges can be addressed by using a weighted runoff coefficient, which can be calculated using Equation 7-22 and takes into account the area of each land use and the corresponding runoff coefficient. By using a weighted runoff coefficient, hydrologists can provide more accurate estimates of peak discharge and better design drainage infrastructure, even in complex and heterogeneous watersheds. Additionally, the use of weighted runoff coefficients can help to reduce the uncertainty associated with hydrological modeling, leading to more reliable and effective water resource management strategies."}]}
{"paragraph": "7.6.3 Designs on Subdivided Watersheds The discussion to this point concerning the Rational Method has used the method only to compute the peak discharge for a contributing area. The method can also be used for nonho- mogeneous watersheds in which the watershed is divided into homogeneous subareas and where multiple inlets and pipe systems are involved. Where a watershed has distinct areas of nonhomogeneity, every attempt should be made to subdivide the watershed into homoge- neous subareas and then use the Rational Method for each subarea or group of subareas. A number of methods have been proposed for solving such problems. One method will be described here and examples provided for illustration. A second method is given in Chap- ter 9. The method described here is an attempt to provide an equal level of protection to each structural element of the total drainage area. It is based on the following two rules for using Equation 7-20: 1. For each inlet area at the headwater of a drainage area the Rational Method (Equation 7-20) is used to compute the peak discharge. 2. For locations where drainage is arriving from two or more inlet areas, the longest time of concentration is used to find the design intensity, a weighted runoff coefficient is computed, and the total drainage area to that point is used with Equation 7-20. It is important to emphasize that Equation 7-20 is not used to compute the discharge from each inlet area and the discharges summed; this would ignore the differences in timing of runoff that exist for the different subareas. The procedure behlnd these two steps will be illustrated with two examples. Example 7-1 1 Figure 7-1 shows the schematic of a drainage area that has been divided into three subareas, with the characteristics of each shown. Beginning with the upstream subarea, the discharge into inlet 1 can be determined. Since the time of concentration is less than 15 min, a duration of Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 A, = 5.3 A2 = 7.2 Aj = 6.4 C3 = 0.6 t, = 7 min Inlet 3 L=600ft L = W f t FIGURE 7-1 Schematic diagram of Tt = 3 min T, = 3 min drainage area. 15 min will be used to obtain the rainfall intensity from Figure 4-4; the intensity for a 10-yr event is 5.4 in./hr. Therefore, the peak discharge into inlet 1 is qpl = 0.2 (5.4 in./hr) (5.3 acres) = 5.7 ft3/s (7-26) The runoff into inlet 1 flows through a pipe, which is 600 ft in length and has a travel time of 3 min. The peak discharge to the inlet from subarea 2 can also be computed from the Rational Formula: q,, = 0.4(5.4 in./hr)(7.2 acres) = 15.6 ft3/sec (7-27) However, the pipe between inlets 2 and 3 should not necessarily be designed to carry the sum of these subarea peak discharges (that is, 21.3 ft3/sec). Subareas 1 and 2 have different times of concentration and the flow from subarea 1 must travel through the 600 ft of pipe before arriving at inlet 2. Therefore, the pipe between inlets 2 and 3 will not be subjected to the sum of the two. Instead, it is common practice to recompute the discharge for the total area using a weighted runoff coefficient and a rainfall intensity based on the longest time of concentration. For the drainage area of Figure 7-1, the weighted runoff coefficient for subareas 1 and 2 is The longest time of concentration for the two subareas would be the sum of the drainage time from subarea 1 and the travel time in the pipe between inlets 1 and 2, which is 13 + 3 = 16 min. From Figure 4-4 the 10-yr intensity is 5.3 in./hr, which yields a peak discharge of The discharge of Equation 7-29 should be used to size the pipe from inlet 2 to inlet 3. The data for subarea 3 could be used to size the inlet for that subarea: 9 ~ =3 0.6 (5.4 in./hr) (6.4 acres) = 20.7 ft 3/sec (7-30) However, the size of the pipe draining the three subareas can be determined using a discharge estimate obtained using a weighted runoff coefficient, which is The longest time of concentration is 19 min, which includes 6 min of travel time in the pipe from inlet I to inlet 3. From Figure 4-4 a rainfall intensity of 4.7 in./hr is obtained and used to com- pute the peak discharge for the entire 18.9 acres: q, = 0.412 (4.8 in./hr) (18.9 acres) = 37.4 ft3/sec (7-32) While the sum of the discharges from the individual subareas is greater than the discharge com- puted in Equation 7-32 (41.8 ft3/sec versus 37.4 ft3/sec), the value computed using the approach Sec. 7.6 Rational Method Feet FIGURE 7-2 Watershed layout for Example 7-12. with the weighted runoff coefficient and the longest time of concentration is an accepted method. It is believed that this approach provides the same level of protection with respect to flood risk at each design point. That is, the inlets and pipe segments would each be designed to pass the flood runoff for the same exceedence frequency, which was 10 years in the example of Figure 7-1. This is probably a reasonable assumption, although it may not be entirely accurate. A method based on hydrographs will be presented in Chapter 9; this method should be more ac- curate for the given assumptions. Example 7-12 Using another hypothetical case, Figure 7-2 shows a 43.8-acre drainage area that includes ap- proximately 11 acres of commercial property, with the remainder in ?&acre and %-acre parcels with residential land use. The existing slope and grading during development has resulted in an area in which all drainage is contained between Glass Boulevard and Polonsky Alley. The upper end of the drainage area is approximately 800 ft north of 3rd Street. The location of the proposed manholes and storm drainage system are shown in Figure 7-2. The outlet will be a single pipe that will run under Main Street at the intersection of Glass Boulevard. The drainage policy re- quires design on a 10-yr exceedence frequency. The computations for the peak discharges are given in Table 7-12. The computations begin for flow into manhole M,,,w hich is at the intersection of 3rd Street and Polonsky Alley. Calculations are provided for the design discharges of both the inlets and the pipes. For some lo- cations there may be more than one inlet at the intersection and so the inlet discharges would have to be divided accordingly. Computations proceed down Polonsky Alley to Main Street. At each manhole, a weighted runoff coefficient is computed, with the weights depending on the drainage area in the different land uses. For example, the weighted runoff coefficient for man- hole M2, is computed by Since all of the inlet times of concentration were less than 15 min, a minimum of 15 min was used. The total times of concentration for the downstream manholes are the sum of the inlet t, for 382 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 TABLE 7-12 Peak Discharge Computations for Drainage System of Figure 7-2 - - - Runoff Intensity Peak, 9, Area (acres) Coefficient (1n.h) (ft3/sec) Inlet Travel Total Manhole Inlet Total Inlet Weighted T,(min) Time(min) T,(min) Inlet Total Inlet Total the upper subarea and the travel times through the pipe systems. Independent calculations can be made for the pipes located on the four north-south roadways. Rainfall intensities are obtained from Figure 4-4 for the 10-yr return period and a duration equal to the time of concentration. The discharges from manholes M,,, M,,, and MI, must be determined using summation of flows from the four feeder lines. The area into manhole MI, consists of the 7.2 acres along Polonsky Alley and the 14.7 acres draining into the inlets along Lynn Avenue. The area into manholes M,, consists of the 21.9 acres draining into manholes M,, and MI, and the 14.7 acres draining into inlets along Car- Avenue. The total area draining into a manhole, the weighted runoff coefficient, and an intensity based on a duration equal to the longest time of concentra- tiodtravel time combination are used to compute the discharge.

Instead, it uses the longest time of concentration to find the design intensity and computes a weighted runoff coefficient for the total drainage area, ensuring that the method provides an equal level of protection to each structural element of the total drainage area. This approach acknowledges that runoff from different subareas does not coincide due to varying times of concentration and travel times through pipe systems, thus avoiding overestimation of peak discharges at downstream locations."}, {"question": "Why is it important to subdivide a watershed into homogeneous subareas when applying the Rational Method for peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "Subdividing a watershed into homogeneous subareas is crucial because it allows for the application of the Rational Method in a way that respects the nonhomogeneous characteristics of the watershed. By doing so, the method can more accurately account for variations in runoff coefficients and times of concentration across different parts of the watershed, leading to more reliable peak discharge estimates. This is particularly important in watersheds with distinct areas of nonhomogeneity, where a single, watershed-wide application of the Rational Method could lead to significant errors in peak discharge estimation."}, {"question": "In the context of designing drainage systems using the Rational Method, what is the significance of using a weighted runoff coefficient?", "answer": "The weighted runoff coefficient is significant in designing drainage systems because it allows for the aggregation of runoff from different land uses or subareas with varying runoff characteristics.

The total drainage area to that point is then used with the Rational Method equation to compute the peak discharge. This approach ensures that the peak discharge estimate accounts for the combined effects of runoff from all contributing areas, without simply summing the peak discharges from each individual area, which would ignore the differences in timing of runoff."}, {"question": "What is the rationale behind using a minimum duration of 15 minutes for rainfall intensity in the Rational Method, as mentioned in the context of Example 7-12?", "answer": "The rationale behind using a minimum duration of 15 minutes for rainfall intensity is not explicitly stated in the provided paragraph but can be inferred as a practical consideration to ensure that the design rainfall intensity is not overly sensitive to very short durations, which might not be representative of the actual storm characteristics that influence peak discharge.

{"paragraph": "7.7 THE SCS RAINFALL-RUNOFF DEPTH RELATION The volume of storm runoff can depend on a number of factors. Certainly, the volume of rainfall will be an important factor. For very large watersheds, the volume of runoff from one storm event may depend on rainfall that occurred during previous storm events. However, Sec. 7.7 The SCS Rainfall-Runoff Depth Relation 383 for smaller watersheds, design hydrologists usually assume that runoff for the current storm event is independent of the rainfall of previous storm events. When using the design-storm approach, the assumption of storm independence is quite common. In addition to rainfall, other factors affect the volume of runoff. A common assumption in hydrologic modeling is that the rainfall available for runoff is separated into three parts: direct (or storm) runoff, initial abstraction, and losses. Factors that affect the split between losses and runoff include the volume of rainfall, land cover and use, soil type, and antecedent moisture conditions. Land cover and land use will determine the amount of depression and interception storage.

This is because different land covers and uses have varying capacities for absorbing and retaining rainfall, influencing the runoff process. For instance, areas with dense vegetation may have higher interception storage, reducing the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff, whereas urban areas with impervious surfaces may have less depression storage, leading to increased runoff."}, {"question": "How do antecedent moisture conditions affect the volume of storm runoff?", "answer": "Antecedent moisture conditions affect the volume of storm runoff by influencing the soil's capacity to absorb additional rainfall.

{"paragraph": "7.7.1 Conceptual Model In developing the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship, the total rainfall was separated into three components: direct runoff (Q), actual retention (F), and the initial abstraction (I,). This is shown schematically in Figure 7-3. Conceptually, the following relationship between P, Q, I,, and F was assumed: F Q - -- - s P-I, in which S is the potential maximum retention. The actual retention is F = (P - I,) - Q (7-35) Substituting Equation 7-35 into Equation 7-34 yields the following: Rearranging Equation 7-36 to solve for Q yields FIGURE 7-3 Separation of rainfall into direct runoff (Q), initial abstraction (Ia), and actual retention (0. ~i~~ Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 FIGURE 7-4 Schematic diagram of the mass curve relationship between rainfall (P),t otal depth (Q), ini- tial abstraction (I,), and actual reten- tion. Equation 7-37 contains one known, P, and two unknowns, I, and S. The variables of Equa- tion 7-37 are best understood when placed in the form of a mass curve. Figure 7-4 shows a schematic of the mass curve of Q versus P. The depth (or volume) of rainfall, P, is separated into the initial abstraction, the retention, and the runoff. Before putting Equation 7-37 in a form that can be used to solve for Q, it may be worthwhile to examine the rationality of the underlying model of Equation 7-34. The initial abstraction is the amount of rainfall at the beginning of a storm that is not available for runoff; therefore, (P-I,) is the rainfall that is available after the initial abstraction has been satisfied. S is the amount of storage (that is, depression, interception, subsurface) available to hold rainfall. Letting K, equal the ratio of (P-I,) to S, K, represents the proportion of water available for runoff per unit of available storage. Setting K2 = QlF, then K2 is the proportion of water that runs off per unit of water retained. Transforming Equation 7-34 indicates that K, = K,. This implies that the proportion of runoff relative to the amount that is retained equals the proportion of the available rain per unit of available storage. Two examples will illustrate the rationale of this equality. Example 7-13 For the first example, assume that a storm with P = 4 in. occurs on two watersheds with different capacities for storage, such as with sandy and clayey soils. We will also assume here that I, = 0.5 in., and for watersheds 1 and 2 we will assume S = 3 and 2 in., respectively. This is shown schematically in Figure 7-5. Rearranging Equations 7-34 and 7-35 provides the following two equations, with two unknowns: FIGURE 7-5 Separation of rainfall (P) into initial abstraction (I,), actual reten- tion (F),a nd direct runoff (Q) for two watersheds with different minimum de- (a) (b) tention: (a) S = 3 in.; (b) S = 2 in. Sac. 7.7 The SCS Rainfall-Runoff Depth Relation and For the case of Figure 7-5a we have and Solving the two linear simultaneous equations of Equations 7-39 yields Q = 1.88 in. and F = 1.62 in.; therefore, QlP = 0.47. For the case of Figure 7-5b, we have and Solving Equations 7-40 yields Q = 2.33 in. and F = 1.27 in.; therefore, QlP = 0.56. The results show that the watershed having the greater storage (5') has a smaller proportion (QlP) of surface runoff. For watershed 2 the value of F is 0.35 in. less than for watershed 1, and Q is 0.35 in. greater. Example 7-14 For the second example, we will consider a single watershed that is subjected to two storm events. For storm events 1 and 2, rainfall depths of 3 and 4 in., respectively, will be used. The watershed will be assumed to have S = 2 in. and I, = 0.5 in. These are shown schematically in Figure 7-6. Solving Equations 7-38 for Q and F of storm event 1 yields Q = 1.39 in. and F = 1.1 1 in.; therefore, QlP = 0.46. For storm event 2, Equations 7-38 yield Q = 2.23 in. and F = 1.27 in.; therefore, QlP = 0.56. The results indicate that for the same storage, a greater pro- portion of rainfall appears as runoff for the larger storm event. From Figure 7-6 it is evident that while F increased by only 0.16 in., Q increased by 0.84 in.; that is, of the last 1 in. of rainfall for storm event 2, 84% went to direct runoff while only 16% went to watershed storage. 1 i FIGURE 7-6 Separation of rainfall (P) into initial abstractions (I,), actual re- 0 0 tention (F),a nd direct runoff (Q) for S P two storm events: (a) P = 3 in.; (bl (b) P = 4 in. 386 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship, what are the three components that total rainfall is separated into?", "answer": "The three components are direct runoff (Q), actual retention (F), and the initial abstraction (I,)."}, {"question": "How does the initial abstraction (I,) affect the amount of rainfall available for runoff in the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship?", "answer": "The initial abstraction (I,) reduces the amount of rainfall available for runoff, as it represents the amount of rainfall at the beginning of a storm that is not available for runoff. This means that only the rainfall amount exceeding the initial abstraction (P-I,) is available for runoff. The initial abstraction plays a crucial role in determining the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff."}, {"question": "Why is the proportion of runoff relative to the amount retained (K2) equal to the proportion of available rain per unit of available storage (K1) in the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship?", "answer": "The proportion of runoff relative to the amount retained (K2) is equal to the proportion of available rain per unit of available storage (K1) because the transformation of Equation 7-34 indicates that K1 = K2. This implies that the proportion of water that runs off per unit of water retained equals the proportion of the available rain per unit of available storage. This relationship highlights the importance of storage capacity in determining runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship, how do different storage capacities affect the proportion of surface runoff?", "answer": "Different storage capacities significantly affect the proportion of surface runoff. For example, a watershed with greater storage capacity (e.g., sandy soil) will have a smaller proportion of surface runoff compared to a watershed with lower storage capacity (e.g., clayey soil). This is because the watershed with greater storage capacity can retain more rainfall, resulting in less runoff. In contrast, a watershed with lower storage capacity will have a larger proportion of surface runoff, as more rainfall will exceed the storage capacity and become runoff."}, {"question": "What is the implication of a larger storm event on the proportion of rainfall that appears as runoff in the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship?", "answer": "A larger storm event will result in a greater proportion of rainfall appearing as runoff. This is because the increased rainfall will exceed the storage capacity of the watershed, leading to more runoff. For example, in the case of a single watershed subjected to two storm events, the larger storm event resulted in a greater proportion of rainfall appearing as runoff (Q/P = 0.56) compared to the smaller storm event (Q/P = 0.46). This highlights the importance of considering storm event size when predicting runoff."}, {"question": "How does the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship account for the effects of initial abstraction and storage capacity on runoff?", "answer": "The SCS rainfall-runoff relationship accounts for the effects of initial abstraction and storage capacity on runoff through the use of the initial abstraction (I,) and potential maximum retention (S) parameters. The initial abstraction reduces the amount of rainfall available for runoff, while the storage capacity determines the proportion of rainfall that is retained or becomes runoff. The relationship between these parameters is captured by the equations F = (P - I,) - Q and Q = (P - I,)(P - I,)/(P - I, + S), which provide a framework for predicting runoff based on rainfall, initial abstraction, and storage capacity."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the storage capacity of a watershed when predicting runoff in the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship?", "answer": "Considering the storage capacity of a watershed is crucial when predicting runoff in the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship because it directly affects the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff. A watershed with greater storage capacity can retain more rainfall, resulting in less runoff, while a watershed with lower storage capacity will have a larger proportion of surface runoff. This highlights the importance of accurately estimating storage capacity when using the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship to predict runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship, what is the relationship between the proportion of runoff and the amount of rainfall?", "answer": "The proportion of runoff increases with the amount of rainfall. As the rainfall amount increases, the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff also increases. This is because the increased rainfall will exceed the storage capacity of the watershed, leading to more runoff. For example, in the case of a single watershed subjected to two storm events, the larger storm event resulted in a greater proportion of rainfall appearing as runoff."}, {"question": "How does the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship handle the case of a watershed with different storage capacities?", "answer": "The SCS rainfall-runoff relationship handles the case of a watershed with different storage capacities by using the potential maximum retention (S) parameter to account for the effects of storage capacity on runoff.

{"paragraph": "7.7.2 Runoff Depth Estimation The results of Examples 7-13 and 7-1 4 suggest that the model of Equation 7-34 provides ra- tional results. Given Equation 7-37, two unknowns must be estimated, S and I,. The reten- tion S should be a function of the following five factors: land use, interception, infiltration, depression storage, and antecedent moisture. The initial abstraction will also depend on these elements of the hydrologic cycle. Empirical evidence indicated that they were related by the following equation: If the five factors above affect S, they also affect I,. Substituting Equation 7-41 into Equa- tion 7-37 yields the following equation, which contains the single unknown, S: Equation 7-42 represents the basic equation for computing the runoff depth, Q, for a given rainfall depth, P. It is worthwhile noting that while Q and P have dimensions of depth (that is, inches), Q and P reflect volumes and are often referred to as volumes because we usually assume that the same depths occurred over the entire watershed. The SCS runoff CN was developed for use with Equation 7-42. Thus there was a need to relate S, which was the unknown of Equation 7-42, and the runoff CN. An empirical analysis led to the following relationship: Equations 7-42 and 7-43 can be used to estimate Q when the values of P and CN are avail- able. It is important to note the following constraint on Equation 7-42: When P < 0.2 S, it is necessary to assume that Q = 0. In addtion to Equations 7-42, 7-43, and 7-44, the runoff depth can be determined using either Figure 7-7 or Table 7-13. The use of Figure 7-7 suffers from the problem of in- terpolation; that is, the accuracy of Q is limited by the degree to which the figure can be in- terpolated. Example 7-15 Detennine the runoff volume for the 24-hr, 100-yr rainfall of 7 in. when the soil is of group B and the watershed is in row crop, contoured in good hydrologic condition. Table 3-18 yields a CN of 75. Equation 7-43 gives s=-1-0 00 10 = 3.333 in. 75 Therefore, the initial abstraction I, from Equation 7-41 is I, = 0.2s = 0.6667 in.

This constraint ensures that the model does not predict runoff when the rainfall is too low to overcome the initial losses and retention."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS runoff CN method, how do Equations 7-42 and 7-43 facilitate the estimation of runoff depth Q?", "answer": "Equations 7-42 and 7-43 facilitate the estimation of runoff depth Q by providing a direct relationship between Q, the rainfall depth P, and the runoff CN. Specifically, Equation 7-43 allows for the calculation of the retention S from the CN, which can then be used in Equation 7-42 to compute Q. This approach enables the estimation of runoff depth when the values of P and CN are available, making it a practical tool for hydrological analysis."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the constraint P < 0.2S on the application of Equation 7-42 for runoff depth estimation?", "answer": "The constraint P < 0.2S implies that Equation 7-42 should only be applied when the rainfall depth P exceeds 20% of the retention S. If P is less than 0.2S, the equation should not be used, as it would predict runoff even when the rainfall is insufficient to generate runoff.

The CN, in turn, is used to calculate the retention S using Equation 7-43, and subsequently, the runoff depth Q is estimated using Equation 7-42.

In this case, the CN values for the subareas are not dissimilar. In such a case, the weighted CN is appropriate. For cases where the differences in the CN are greater than 5, it is preferable to weight the Q rather than the CN. For the data above, the following shows the Q for each subarea: Set. 7.7 The SCS Rainfall-Runoff Depth Relation Area Fraction CN Q (in.) This yields the following weighted Q: + + + Q = 0.40 (4.47) 0.25 (4.37) 0.20 (4.69) 0.15 (5.03) = 4.57 in. The weighted Q is only 0.01 in. different from the Q computed with the weighted CN. When the CN variation is greater than in this example (that is, 78 to 83), the two estimates of Q will show a greater difference than the difference of 0.01 in. shown in this example. Example 7-17 will illus- trate this point. Example 7-17 Consider the case of a watershed that is 25% residential (%-acre lots) on an A soil and 75% open space (fair condition) on an A soil. The CNs are 77 and 49, respectively, so the weighted CN would be For a rainfall of 3.2 in., Q equals 0.28. The runoff depths for the residential and open space land uses are 1.21 and 0.1 1 in., respectively. Thus the weighted Q would be + Q = 0.25(1.21) 0.75(0.11) = 0.385 in. Thus the two methods provide estimates of Q that differ by more than 30%. This example was used to illustrate the weighted CN concept. Using a weighted CN to es- timate Q will not be significantly in error when P is large and when the CN values are nearly equal. The relative error increases as P decreases and as the differences in CNs increase. It is best to compute the individual Q values and then compute the weighted value of Q than to use a weighted CN to compute Q.

Using a weighted CN can lead to errors, particularly when the CN variation is greater than 5, as seen in Example 7-17 where the estimates of Q differed by more than 30%. It is recommended to compute individual Q values and then compute the weighted value of Q for more accurate results, especially in cases with large differences in CN values or smaller rainfall amounts."}, {"question": "Why does the difference in estimates of Q between using a weighted CN and computing individual Q values increase as the rainfall amount decreases and the differences in CNs increase?", "answer": "The difference in estimates of Q between the two methods increases as the rainfall amount decreases and the differences in CNs increase because the weighted CN approach assumes a linear relationship between CN and runoff depth, which may not hold true for all conditions. When rainfall is small, even small differences in CN can lead to significant differences in runoff depth, and when CN values are very different, the weighted average may not accurately represent the runoff characteristics of the watershed.

The advantage of computing the weighted Q is that it takes into account the specific runoff characteristics of each land use and soil type, providing a more accurate estimate of runoff depth, especially in watersheds with diverse conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of a watershed with multiple land uses and soil types, why is it necessary to consider the area fraction of each land use and soil type combination when computing the weighted Q?", "answer": "Considering the area fraction of each land use and soil type combination is necessary because it allows for the accurate representation of the runoff characteristics of the entire watershed.

Furthermore, the ability to hold IJP constant and observe consistent unit runoff responses, regardless of CN and P combinations, underscores the potential of IJP to simplify and enhance the analysis of complex hydrological systems."}, {"question": "How does the IJP parameter relate to the initial abstraction (I) and the 24-hr rainfall depth (P)?", "answer": "The IJP parameter is directly related to the initial abstraction (I) and the 24-hr rainfall depth (P), as it is calculated based on these two values. The IJP value represents the fraction of rainfall that must occur before runoff begins, and it is influenced by both the initial abstraction, which affects how much rainfall is initially absorbed, and the 24-hr rainfall depth, which determines the total amount of rainfall available for runoff."}]}

However, this method also implies a level of simplification and assumption about the hydrological processes, such as the representation of initial abstraction and the relationship between rainfall and runoff.

{"paragraph": "7.8.3 Pond and Swamp Adjustment The peak discharge obtained from Equation 7-45 assumes that the topography is such that surface flow into ditches, drains, and streams is relatively unimpeded. Where ponding or swampy areas occur in the watershed, a considerable amount of the surface runoff may be retained in temporary storage. The peak discharge rate should be reduced to reflect this condition of increased storage. Values of the pond and swamp adjustment factor (F,) are provided in Table 7-16. The adjustment factor values in Table 7-16 are a function of the storm exceedence frequency (T), the percent of the total watershed area in ponds and swamps (PPS), and the primary location of the pond and swamp areas.

The value of Fp is dependent on PPS rather than the volume of pond and swamp storage. Given the dependency of peak discharges on the volume of runoff, it is only reasonable that the adjustment factor Fp is an approximation of the true ef- fect of ponds and swamp storage on peak discharge. The accuracy of the adjustment factor Fp depends on the degree to which the actual volume of pond and swamp storage agrees with the \"average\" volume of storage indicated by PPS and used to determine the values of Fp in Table 7-16.

This approach assumes a relationship between the area of ponds and swamps and their storage capacity, which may not always hold true. As a result, the accuracy of peak discharge predictions may vary, especially in watersheds where the actual storage volume significantly differs from the average volume indicated by PPS.

{"paragraph": "7.8.4 Limitations The SCS Graphical Method has a number of limitations. When these conditions are not met, the accuracy of estimated peak discharges decreases. The method should be used on water- sheds that are homogeneous in CN, where parts of the watershed have CNs that differ by 5, the watershed should be subdivided and a hydrograph method should be used (see Chap- ter 9). The Graphical Method should be used only when the CN is 50 or greater and the tc is greater than 0.1 hr or less than 10 hr. Also, the computed value of IJP should be between 0.1 and 0.5. The method should be used only when the watershed has one main channel or when there are two main channels that have nearly equal times of concentration; otherwise, a hy- drograph method (see Chapter 9) should be used. Other methods should also be used when channel or reservoir routing is required, or where watershed storage is either greater than 5% or located on the flow path used to compute the tc. Example 7-19 Figure 7-10 shows a strip development on a small upland watershed. The developer is interested in estimating the peak discharge for the contributing area after development. The developed por- tion of the area is 15.75 acres, with %- and %-acre lots. The developed area is graded so that runoff will collect in grass-lined swales at the front of the lot and drain to a paved swale that flows along the side of the main road. Flow from the paved swales passes through a pipe culvert to the upper end of the stream channel. The upper portion of the watershed, with is bounded by the contour for 164 ft, is forested on B soil (CN = 60) and has an area of 7.25 acres. To use the Graphical Method, an estimate of the time of concentration is required; the flow path used to compute t, is shown in Figure 7-10 by a series of four arrows, with each arrow representing a different flow regime. The runoff flows overland in the forest, and then enters a grass-lined swale. Computations of travel times are given in Table 7-17. A total travel time of 2960 sec represents a time of concentration of 0.82 hr. The Graphical Method also requires the depth of runoff. Assuming the local drainage policy requires 10-yr control, Figure 4-4 indicates a 24-hr rainfall depth of 4.8 in. (0.2 in.h * 24 hr). A detailed site layout indicates that 21% of the developed area will be impervious, with all of the area connected to the primary drainage system. Thus for a B soil the weighted CN is For a CN of 66 and a 4.8-in. rainfall, Equation 7 4 2 y ields a runoff depth of 1.59 in. Table 7-14 gives a value of 0.21 for 1JP.

The principal flow path from the outlet to the drainage divide has a length of 1050 ft. A pre- and post-development evaluation will be made, with the design based on a return period of 25 yr. The basic inputs to use the Graphical Method are the 24-hr rainfall, the CN, the drainage area, and the time of concentration. For a 25-yr, 24-hr storm event, the intensity (from Figure 4-4) is 0.245 in./hr, which yields a depth of 5.9 in. For a forested (fair condition) watershed over a C soil, the CN (from Table 3-18) is 73. For a drop in elevation of less than 20 ft in 1000 ft, the watershed has a slope of 1.7%. Using a rainfall of 5.9 in. and a CN of 73, Equation 7 4 2 y ields a runoff depth of 3.01 in. A value of 0.12 for IJP is obtained from Table 7-14. For a slope of 1.7% on a forested watershed, Figure 3-19 indicates a velocity of 0.32 ftlsec; this yields a t, of 0.91 1 hr. From Figure 7-9c, we obatin a unit peak discharge of 360 ft3/sec/mi2/inch.T hus the pre-development peak discharge computed with Equation 7 4 2 i s q, = (360 ft 3/sec/mi2/in.) (0.02284 mi2) (3.01 in.) = 25 ft 3/sec The layout for the proposed shopping center is shown in Figure 7-1 1b. A total of 360,000 ft2 will be developed with 328,800 ft2 covered with impervious land covers and 31,200 ft2 as grass cover in good condition. From Table 3-18, CN values of 98 and 74 are obtained for the im- pervious and grass covers, respectively. Thus the weighted CN is The increase in CN from the pre-development CN of 73 results in an increase in the runoff depth. For a rainfall depth of 5.9 in, Equation 7 4 2 yields a runoff depth of 4.3 1 in. For an increase in CN, I, will decrease; from Table 7-14, the IJP ratio decreases to 0.1. The shopping center alters the longest flow path, as shown in Figure 7-1 1. The post-development condition has 525 ft of flow in the forested area; for a drop in elevation of 6.5 ft, the slope is 1.2%, which yields a flow velocity of 0.27 ftlsec (from Figure 3-19) and thus a travel time of 0.540 hr. For the flow around the perimeter of the developed shopping area, the flow length is 700 ft, with a slope of 1.3%. From Figure 3-19 we get a flow velocity of 2.3 ftlsec. This yields a travel time of 0.0845 hr. Thus the time of concentration, which is the sum of the travel times, equals 0.625 hr. From Fig- ure 7-9c we get a unit peak discharge of 465 ft3/sec/mi2/in.T hus the post-development peak dis- charge is q, = (465 ft '/sec/mi2/in.)

Use of this procedure assumes the following conditions: (1) the channel reach should be relatively uniform; (2) the difference in elevation AE should be at least 0.5 ft; (3) the sec- tion should not meander significantly and it should be free of obstructions (bridges, culverts, etc.). Example 7-21 After a flood, a hydrologic engineer estimates the discharge rate at a section where the flood overtopped the banks. At the time when the flow at the upstream cross section just overtopped its banks, the elevation at the downstream section was 3.6 ft. lower. A surveyor obtains cross- section information at both sections.

The total conveyance for the section is then calculated as the sum of the conveyances for the subsections, allowing for a more accurate estimation of discharge rates in complex channel geometries."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to estimate the energy gradient in the slope-area method, and how is it initially calculated?", "answer": "Estimating the energy gradient is necessary because it is a critical component in calculating the peak discharge rate. The energy gradient is initially calculated using the difference in elevations of the high-water marks at the two sections (AE) divided by the reach length (L) as measured along the thalweg of the channel. This initial estimate is then refined through an iterative process that takes into account the difference in velocity heads at the two sections, ensuring a more accurate estimation of the energy gradient and, consequently, the peak discharge rate."}, {"question": "In the slope-area method, what conditions must be met for the channel reach to be considered suitable for discharge estimation?", "answer": "For the slope-area method to be applicable, the channel reach should be relatively uniform, the difference in elevation (AE) should be at least 0.5 ft, and the section should not meander significantly and should be free of obstructions such as bridges or culverts. These conditions ensure that the method provides a reliable estimate of the peak discharge rate."}, {"question": "How does the iterative process in the slope-area method improve the accuracy of peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "The iterative process in the slope-area method involves recalculating the energy gradient and peak discharge rate until the computed discharge rate does not change. This process improves accuracy by progressively refining the estimate of the energy gradient, taking into account the difference in velocity heads at the two sections. By doing so, it minimizes errors that could arise from initial assumptions, leading to a more precise estimation of the peak discharge rate."}, {"question": "What is the role of Manning's roughness coefficient in the slope-area method, and how does it affect the calculation of conveyance?", "answer": "Manning's roughness coefficient (n) is a critical parameter in the slope-area method, as it affects the calculation of conveyance (K) at both the upstream and downstream sections. The conveyance is calculated using the formula K = 1.49 A R^(2/3) / n, where A is the cross-sectional area and R is the hydraulic radius. A higher value of n indicates a rougher channel, which results in lower conveyance and, consequently, affects the estimated peak discharge rate."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the velocity head coefficients at both cross sections in the slope-area method?", "answer": "Considering the velocity head coefficients at both cross sections is important because it allows for the accurate calculation of the difference in velocity heads, which is a critical component in the iterative process of refining the energy gradient and peak discharge rate estimates. The velocity head coefficients account for the distribution of velocity across the cross-section, ensuring that the method captures the complexities of flow behavior in the channel."}, {"question": "In the context of the slope-area method, how does the calculation of peak discharge rate (q) relate to the conveyance (K) and energy gradient (S)?", "answer": "The calculation of the peak discharge rate (q) in the slope-area method is directly related to the conveyance (K) and energy gradient (S) through the formula q = KS^(1/2). This relationship highlights the importance of accurately estimating both the conveyance, which depends on the channel's geometric and roughness characteristics, and the energy gradient, which reflects the channel's slope and flow conditions. The product of these two factors gives the peak discharge rate, making their accurate estimation crucial for reliable discharge predictions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not meeting the conditions for a suitable channel reach in the slope-area method?", "answer": "Not meeting the conditions for a suitable channel reach, such as having a non-uniform channel, insufficient elevation difference, or significant meandering and obstructions, can lead to inaccurate estimates of peak discharge rates. This inaccuracy arises because the slope-area method assumes certain conditions that, if not met, can introduce errors in the calculation of conveyance, energy gradient, and ultimately, the peak discharge rate. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the channel reach before applying the slope-area method to ensure the reliability of the discharge estimates."}]}
{"paragraph": "7.10 PEAK DISCHARGE ENVELOPE CURVES Design storms are hypothetical constructs and have never occurred. Many design engineers like to have some assurance that a design peak discharge is unlikely to occur over the design life of a project. n s cr eates an interest in comparing the design peak to actual peaks of record. Crippen and Bue (1977) developed envelope curves for the conterminous United States, with seventeen regions delineated (see Figure 7-12). Maximum floodflow data from 883 sites that have drainage areas less than 10,000 sq. mi (25,900 sq. km) were graphed ver- sus drainage area. Figure 7-13 shows the nationwide envelope curve. The curves for the sev- enteen regions were fit to the following logarithmic polynomial model: FIGURE 7-12 Map of the conterminous United States showing flood-region boundaries (from Crippen and Bue, 1977). Sec. 7.10 Peak Discharge Envelope Curves FIGURE 7-13 Selected peak discharges versus drainage areas, and nationwide en- velope curve (from Crippen and Bue, 1977). = lob, + b,log A + b, (log A)'+ b3 (log A)' (7-55) P in which A is the drainage area (sq. mi) and qp is the maximum floodflow (ft3/sec). Table 7-1 8 gives the values of the coefficients (b,, b,, b,, and b, of Equation 7-55) and the upper limit on the drainage area for each region. The curves are valid for drainage areas greater than 0.1 sq. mi; the smallest area used for the nationwide curve was 0.3 sq. mi. Crip- pen and Bue did not assign an exceedence probability to the floodflows used to fit the curves, so a probability cannot be given to values estimated from the curves. Example 7-22 Table 7-19 contains the annual maximum flood record for Oak Creek near Mojave, CA. The record includes a historic flood of 43,500 ft3/sec that occurred in 1932. The historic event is 25 times larger than the largest flood in the systematic record. The watershed area is 15.8 sq. mi. The watershed is located in region 16 of Figure 7-12. Using the coefficients from Table 7-18, the maximum floodflow for a watershed of that size in the region would be The envelope discharge is approximately twice the magnitude of the historic peak. 404 Peak Discharge Estimation Chap. 7 TABLE 7-18 Coefficients for Equations of Crippen and Bue (1977) Envelope Curves Coefficient Upper Limit Region (sq. mi.) 4, b, b2 63 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Nationwide 7.1 1 REGlONALlZATlON OF HYDROLOGIC VARIABLES Design methods for specific localities or regions are widely used. The skew map of Chap- ter 5 and the soil maps discussed in Chapter 3 are examples of important hydrologic design elements that show regional variation. The four SCS rainfall distributions of Chapter 4 indi- cate that rainfall hyetograph characteristics vary spatially. It was necessary to regionalize the peak discharge envelope curves of Section 7.10 because maximum floodflows are quite dif- ferent in various parts of the country. When hydrologic variables (such as maximum flood- flows, minimum flows, rainfall, or water quality characteristics) vary spatially, an underlying cause related to the physical processes is involved. Regionalization should be based on knowledge of the physical processes; however, statistical analyses can assist in delineating regional boundaries. TABLE 7-19 Annual Maximum Flood Series (1958-1984) and a Historical Flood for Oak Creek near Mojave, CA (Area = 15.8 sq. mi.) *Historic event, 1932 Sec. 7.1 1 Regionalization of Hydrologic Variables 405 Regionalization of a design method is undertaken because it can improve the accuracy of predictions. For example, if a state could be divided into two parts that indicate where hurri- canes are common and where they are rare, the hurricane part would have higher floodflows for a given exceedence probability. If one equation were developed using all flood records in the state, then it would probably tend to underpredict in the hurricane-prone region and over- predict in the nonhurricane-prone region. Such an equation would be biased. By separating the state into two regions and developing separate equations from the flood records in the two re- gions, we would expect the two equations to provide more accurate predictions in their respec- tive regions. These equations would be unbiased. Greater prediction accuracy should be re- flected in the goodness-of-fit statistics (for example, correlation coefficient and standard error of estimate) of the regionalized equations compared to those of the single statewide equation. The two most difficult aspects of the regionalization process are the decision that re- gionalization needs to be considered and then the identification of the boundary lines between the regions. Typically, the hydrologist has unique knowledge of the hydrologic characteristics of the area; this will be very useful in interpreting any statistical analyses used to delineate the boundary. Regionalization is one option to consider when the prediction accuracy of a design method is believed to be less than attainable. If the goodness-of-fit statistics for a statistical analysis of regional data are considered low, then analyses should be made to determine whether or not the prediction accuracy can be improved by partitioning the area into regions. Once a decision has been made to regionalize the design method, it is necessary to de- termine the number of regions and the boundaries of each region. A common procedure for regionalizing a design method is to develop a prediction equation for the entire area and make a spatial graph of the residuals (for example, differences between the predicted and measured values of the criterion variable). The value of each residual is plotted on a map of the area at the location of the corresponding gage. An attempt is then made to draw isolines of the residuals. If a spatial pattern is apparent in the map of the residuals, then two or more regions may be needed. The presence of a pattern suggests that the design equation for the entire area produced biased estimates in parts of the area. The intent of regionalization will be to eliminate the spatial bias. The hydrologist will then attempt to identify an association between the pattern in the residuals and an important hydrologic characteristic(s). The boundaries of each region should be established on the basis of the underlying hy- drologic processes. The residuals may suggest approximate locations for the boundaries, but they need to be justified using hydrologic criteria. Very often, political boundaries are used within a state, however individual counties often have different policies and design practices, so in some instances the regional boundaries may be made to coincide with political boundaries.

Assume that the peak discharge q, of the Rational Method results from a storm of constant in- tensity i over a storm duration equal to the time of concentration t,. Runoff is produced by a pro- portion of the total volume of rainfall equal to the runoff coefficient C.

Based on these assumptions derive the Rational Formula. Show that it would be in- correct to use a time base other than 2 t,. 7-22. A design engineer makes numerous peak discharge estimates for small watersheds (2 to 10 acres) for 5-yr return periods. Most are made for single-family residential developments in areas where Figure 44 would be applicable.

This allows for more accurate predictions of peak discharges in different regions."}, {"question": "Why is regionalization of hydrologic variables necessary for improving the accuracy of predictions in design methods?", "answer": "Regionalization is necessary because hydrologic variables, such as maximum floodflows, rainfall, or water quality characteristics, vary spatially due to underlying physical processes. By dividing an area into regions with distinct hydrologic characteristics, design methods can be tailored to each region, reducing bias and improving prediction accuracy. This is particularly important in areas with diverse hydrologic conditions, such as those prone to hurricanes or with varying soil types."}, {"question": "In the context of regionalization, what is the role of statistical analyses in delineating regional boundaries?", "answer": "Statistical analyses, such as plotting residuals on a map and attempting to draw isolines, can assist in identifying spatial patterns and suggesting approximate locations for regional boundaries.

By incorporating BDF into the equations, the impact of urbanization on peak discharge rates can be estimated, allowing for more accurate design and planning in urban areas."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a single, statewide equation for peak discharge estimation versus using regionalized equations?", "answer": "Using a single, statewide equation can lead to biased estimates, as it fails to account for regional variations in hydrologic characteristics. In contrast, regionalized equations can provide more accurate predictions by capturing the unique hydrologic conditions of each region. This is particularly important in states with diverse hydrologic conditions, where a single equation may underpredict in some areas and overpredict in others, leading to potential design and safety issues."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, why is it important to consider the index-flood equation and index ratios?", "answer": "The index-flood equation and index ratios are important because they allow for the estimation of flood frequencies for different return periods, enabling designers and planners to assess the likelihood and potential impact of floods. By calibrating the index-flood equation and index ratios using observed data, more accurate flood frequency curves can be developed, which is crucial for designing and managing flood mitigation measures."}, {"question": "How do the log-Pearson Type III frequency curve and the log-normal flood frequency curve differ in their application to flood frequency analysis?", "answer": "The log-Pearson Type III frequency curve and the log-normal flood frequency curve differ in their application to flood frequency analysis in that the log-Pearson Type III curve is often used for larger watersheds and requires a skew coefficient, whereas the log-normal curve is commonly used for smaller watersheds and does not require a skew coefficient.

Area Soil Fraction Land UselCondition Group", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of estimating peak discharge, what is the significance of the Rational Method in hydrology?", "answer": "The Rational Method is a technique used to estimate peak discharge from a watershed, taking into account factors such as runoff coefficient, time of concentration, and rainfall intensity. It is commonly applied for small to medium-sized watersheds and is useful for designing drainage systems and culverts. The method assumes that the peak discharge occurs when the rainfall intensity equals the infiltration capacity of the soil."}, {"question": "How does the runoff coefficient (C) affect the estimation of peak discharge in the Rational Method?", "answer": "The runoff coefficient (C) is a critical parameter in the Rational Method, as it represents the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff. A higher C value indicates a greater amount of impervious surface area, resulting in more runoff and a higher peak discharge. For example, a watershed with a high percentage of paved surfaces will have a higher C value compared to one with more vegetated areas."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed analysis, why is it essential to consider the time of concentration (tc) when estimating peak discharge?", "answer": "The time of concentration (tc) is the time it takes for runoff to travel from the most distant point in the watershed to the outlet. Considering tc is crucial because it affects the peak discharge estimation, as it influences the rainfall intensity and duration that contributes to the peak flow. A longer tc can result in a lower peak discharge, as the rainfall intensity may decrease over time, while a shorter tc can lead to a higher peak discharge due to the more rapid concentration of runoff."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a minimum time of concentration of 15 minutes, as allowed by local drainage policies, on peak discharge estimation?", "answer": "Using a minimum time of concentration of 15 minutes can significantly impact peak discharge estimation, as it may not accurately represent the actual time it takes for runoff to travel through the watershed. This can lead to overestimation or underestimation of peak discharge, potentially affecting the design of drainage systems and culverts. For instance, if the actual tc is shorter than 15 minutes, using this minimum value may result in underestimating the peak discharge, while a longer actual tc may lead to overestimation."}, {"question": "How does the land use and soil type affect the estimation of peak discharge in the Rational Method?", "answer": "Land use and soil type play a significant role in estimating peak discharge, as they influence the runoff coefficient (C) and time of concentration (tc). For example, a watershed with a high percentage of impervious surfaces, such as paved roads and buildings, will have a higher C value compared to one with more vegetated areas. Similarly, soil type affects the infiltration capacity, with more permeable soils resulting in lower C values and longer tc."}, {"question": "In the context of flood frequency analysis, why is it essential to compute the moment ratios for return periods?", "answer": "Computing moment ratios for return periods is crucial in flood frequency analysis, as it allows for the estimation of peak discharges for different return periods. The moment ratios provide a way to scale the index flood to other return periods, enabling the construction of a flood frequency curve. This curve is essential for designing flood protection measures, such as levees and flood-control structures, and for assessing the risk of flooding in a given area."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the index-flood approach in flood frequency analysis, and how does it relate to the Rational Method?", "answer": "The index-flood approach is a method used to estimate flood frequencies by scaling an index flood to other return periods using moment ratios. The Rational Method can be used to compute the index flood, which is then scaled to other return periods using the moment ratios. This approach allows for the estimation of peak discharges for different return periods, providing a more comprehensive understanding of flood risk and enabling the design of more effective flood protection measures."}, {"question": "How does the empirical relationship of Equation 7-41 relate to the estimation of potential maximum retention in a watershed?", "answer": "The empirical relationship of Equation 7-41 provides a way to estimate the potential maximum retention in a watershed based on the runoff volume and rainfall depth.

However, typically, the CN approach uses a curve number that represents the runoff potential of the area based on land use, soil type, and other factors, while the Q approach might directly calculate runoff based on storm depth and other hydrological parameters."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to compute the depth of runoff for different storm depths, such as 3 and 5 inches?", "answer": "Computing the depth of runoff for different storm depths is necessary to understand how varying rainfall amounts affect runoff. This is crucial for planning and management purposes, as different storm depths can lead to significantly different runoff volumes, impacting flood risk, water resource availability, and erosion potential. By analyzing runoff at different storm depths, hydrologists can better predict and prepare for the impacts of storms on watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, how do land use and soil conditions influence the runoff curve number?", "answer": "Land use and soil conditions significantly influence the runoff curve number because they affect the infiltration capacity and runoff potential of an area. Different land uses (e.g., urban, agricultural, forested) and soil types have varying infiltration rates and surface roughness, which in turn affect how much rainfall becomes runoff versus infiltration. For instance, urban areas with impervious surfaces tend to have higher runoff curve numbers (and thus more runoff) compared to forested areas with high infiltration capacities."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of using a weighted approach in calculating runoff curve numbers?", "answer": "The purpose of using a weighted approach is to account for the variability and distribution of different factors (such as soil, land use, and condition) within the area of interest. By weighting these factors, the calculation can more accurately reflect the composite runoff potential of the area, providing a more realistic estimate of runoff depths for given storm conditions."}, {"question": "How do changes in storm depth impact the calculation of runoff using the weighted CN and weighted Q approaches?", "answer": "Changes in storm depth directly impact the calculation of runoff in both approaches. For the weighted CN approach, a higher storm depth would result in a higher runoff depth because the curve number method is sensitive to the amount of rainfall. Similarly, for the weighted Q approach, an increase in storm depth would lead to an increase in runoff depth, as the method directly relates runoff to storm depth and other hydrological parameters. The exact nature of these impacts can vary based on the specifics of the watershed and the parameters used in each approach."}, {"question": "In the context of water resource management, why is understanding runoff depths for different storm scenarios crucial?", "answer": "Understanding runoff depths for different storm scenarios is crucial for water resource management because it allows for the prediction and mitigation of flood risks, the optimization of water storage and supply systems, and the implementation of effective erosion control measures. By knowing how different storm depths affect runoff, managers can make informed decisions about infrastructure design, floodplain management, and water allocation, ultimately protecting both human settlements and the environment."}, {"question": "How does the computation of weighted runoff curve numbers contribute to hydrological modeling and prediction?", "answer": "The computation of weighted runoff curve numbers is a critical component of hydrological modeling and prediction because it provides a quantitative measure of an area's runoff potential.

By understanding the runoff potential of different areas based on their land use and soil conditions, planners and managers can make informed decisions about development patterns, conservation efforts, and best management practices. This can help in minimizing flood risks, protecting water quality, and maintaining ecosystem services within watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of the given problem, how would one proceed to compute the weighted runoff curve number for the specified conditions?", "answer": "To compute the weighted runoff curve number, one would first need to determine the curve numbers for each soil fraction and land use condition group within the area.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to malung technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1. What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? Discussion Question 415 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. A hydrologist who works for a land development company performs all of the flood peak estimations required for the company's projects. He routinely makes peak dis- charge estimates using both the Rational Method and the SCS Graphical Method and uses the smaller value because it can reduce project costs associated with the smaller inlets, pipes, culverts, and storm water detention basins required. The local drainage policy does not specifically state which method should be used for making peak discharge estimates, so it does not prohibit the practice.

A higher percent of imperviousness will result in a higher CN, indicating a greater amount of runoff. This is because impervious surfaces, such as pavement and buildings, do not allow water to infiltrate into the soil, resulting in increased runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS Graphical Method, what is the significance of the IJP ratio?", "answer": "The IJP ratio is used to adjust the peak discharge estimate based on the amount of ponds and swamps in the watershed.

These limitations are important to consider when selecting a method for peak discharge estimation, as they can affect the accuracy of the estimate. The method's limitations can also affect the applicability of the method to different types of watersheds, and may require the use of alternative methods in certain cases."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the hydrologic implications of the results when computing the IJP ratio?", "answer": "It is important to consider the hydrologic implications of the results when computing the IJP ratio because the IJP ratio can have a significant impact on the peak discharge estimate.

Considering tc is crucial because it helps designers determine the peak discharge rate and ensure that the drainage system can handle the maximum flow rate. If the tc is not accurately estimated, the drainage system may be undersized, leading to flooding and other issues."}, {"question": "What is the difference between the pre-development and post-development peak discharge rates (qpb and qpa), and how do they relate to urbanization?", "answer": "The pre-development peak discharge rate (qpb) refers to the peak flow rate before urbanization, while the post-development peak discharge rate (qpa) represents the peak flow rate after urbanization. Urbanization typically increases the peak discharge rate due to the replacement of permeable surfaces with impervious ones, leading to a higher qpa value.

{"paragraph": "8.2 DESIGN OF ROOF DRAINAGE It should be obvious that rooftop drainage is an important element of building design. Im- proper drainage can lead to building damage and minor public health problems. A number of methods are available for designing roof drains; an approximation will be provided here. Figure 8-1 shows a schematic of a roof drainage system for a large building. Rain falls on the roof, which has a very shallow slope, and collects at the roof drain inlet. After passing through the inlet the runoff falls through a leader pipe to a horizontal pipe that transports the water to a vertical drain pipe that is either attached to an exterior wall or within the wall. The runoff is discharged from the vertical drain into a horizontal storm sewer. Both the horizontal roof drain pipe and the storm sewer are laid at shallow slopes. In addition to the pipe system, roofs should be designed with scuppers, which are pipes in the parapet of the roof; scuppers serve as emergency drains that permit overflow in cases where the roof drain becomes clogged by debris or ice. To use the design method provided here, the following variables are required input: the roof area and layout, the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationship for the location, l-7 NO SCALE Scupper Roof drain Leader Exterior wall drain Vertical drain FIGURE 8-1 Schematic diagram of a roof drainage system. Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8 and the slope of the horizontal drains located in the roof. The rainfall information, specifi- cally the design return period and storm duration, is usually set by local building codes; for example, the code might state that the design rainfall is the 5-yr, 0.1-hr intensity. The design method assumes that all rainfall is converted to runoff; that is, the method assumes that there are no losses such as depression storage. The objective of a design is to size the vertical leader (see Figure 8-I), the vertical drains, and the horizontal drain pipes. The design procedure is as follows: 1. Determine the number of drains. 2. Determine the design rainfall intensity based on the duration and frequency specified in the local policy. 3. Determine the flow capacity per drain. 4. Design the system by computing the size of the leader, vertical drains, and horizontal drains. As a general rule, there should be one drain per 10,000 ft2 of roof area, with a mini- mum of two drains per roof. Based on the policy statement or local building codes, the de- sign rainfall intensity is obtained from the local IDF curve (for example, Figure 4-4). The in- tensity i in in./hr can be converted to a unit discharge rate Q, in gallrnidsq. ft of roof area using Q, = 0.0104 i (8-1 The total discharge rate Q, for a rooftop of area A in sq. ft is The capacity per drain Q, equals the total flow Q, divided by the number of drains, n. Q, and Q, have units of volume per unit time and thus correspond to a peak discharge. The diameter d (in.) of both the leader and the vertical drains is given by in which Q, is the capacity per drain in gallrnin. The diameter of horizontal pipes in in. is a function of both Q, and the slope of the horizontal drain S in in./ft d = 0.53s- 0.188~!377 (8-4) Diameters estimated with Equations 8-3 and 8-4 should be rounded up to the next larger commercially available size so that the pipe capacity will be sufficient to drain the design flow Q,. For roof drains, the following pipe diameters (in.) are usually available commer- cially: 2,4,6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18. Equation 8-3 should be accurate for flow rates less than 6000 gaYmin, and Equation 8-4 should be valid for slopes from 0.125 to 0.5 in./ft and diameters less than 18 in. Example 8-1 The design method will be illustrated for a commercial building with a flat roof of 80,000 ft? (200 x 400 ft). Thus according to the rule of thumb, a total of eight drains will be required. The layout of the drains is shown in Figure 8-2. If the local drainage policy requires a 10-yr, 0.1-hr Sec. 8.3 Design of Shallow Channels I Roof drain (8 in.) ----- I I I I I I 0 Vertical drain (10 in.) loin. - - Horizontal drain ------ Subarea drain* boundary 8 in. 10 in.

Thus the total flow for the eight drains would be or 770 gaUmin per drain. The diameters of the eight leaders are computed with Equation 8-3: d = 0.6 (770)O.~=~ ~7. 35 in. (8-6) which translates into an 8-in. leader. If the horizontal pipes leading from the roof drains to the wall are set at a slope of 0.125 in./ft, then Equation 8-4 yields a required diameter of Thus, a 10-in. diameter pipe would be used. If the horizontal pipe draining the four interior lead- ers in the interior walls are laid at a slope of 0.5 in./ft, these would require the following diame- ter: d = 0.53 (0.5)-~.('~77~0 )O.~=~ 7~. 4 in. (8-8) which translates into an 8-in. pipe. When the horizontal pipes from the interior leaders connect with the pipes from the exterior leaders, the total flow draining the 20,000 ft2 will be 1540 gallrnin. The pipe diameter for these sections, assuming a slope of 0.5 in./ft, is d = 0.53 (0.5)-~.'(~1~5 40)O.~=~ ~9. 6 in . (8-9) which translates into a 10-in. pipe. Equation 8-3 would be used to compute the diameters of the four vertical drains: d = 0.6 (1540)O.~=~ ~9. 6 in. (8-1 0) which translates into a commercial pipe diameter of 10 in.

The equations are useful for several aspects of design. If the discharge from a highway and adjacent land is computed with an equation such as the Rational Method, the depth of flow at the gutter and the spread of the water surface (T) over the highway surface can be es- timated. In the design of a highway section, estimating the curb height necessary to contain the flow within the gutter is a part of the design. The allowable spread is set by policy and is an important design variable. The spread is a function of the type of highway, the traffic vol- ume, and the importance of the highway in maintaining traffic patterns. For streets near hos- pitals or schools and major arteries, the policy may require the spread be limited to the adja- cent right-of-way and not extend onto the roadway. For streets subject to low traffic volumes, a policy may allow one-half of the roadway to be covered with water. The equa- tions of Figure 8-3 can be useful in solving such problems. Example 8-2 To illustrate the use of the equations of Figure 8-3 consider a 5.8-acre watershed that drains a section of hlghway and an adjacent grass-covered area.

In order to complete the environmental report, the engineer needs to estimate the amount of petroleum that leaked out of the tank during the 25 min between the time of the puncture and the time that the hole was plugged. The surface elevation of the pe- troleum above the ground was 8.46 ft after the leak was stopped. The tank has a diameter of 40 ft.

A common value used is 0.6, but it can vary based on the specifics of the orifice, such as the presence of jagged edges, which can reduce the coefficient."}, {"question": "In the scenario of the forklift puncturing the storage tank, how was the volume of the leaked petroleum estimated, and what factors could affect the accuracy of this estimation?", "answer": "The volume of the leaked petroleum was estimated using the orifice equation, with the discharge coefficient adjusted for the jagged edges of the hole. The estimation used the final fluid height to calculate the discharge rate, which might not accurately represent the initial conditions. Factors affecting the accuracy include the change in height from the time of puncture to the time of plugging and the assumption of a constant discharge coefficient. The actual volume discharged could be between the estimates calculated using the initial and final heights."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the vena contracta in orifice flow, and how does it relate to the discharge coefficient?", "answer": "The vena contracta is the point below the orifice where the cross-sectional area is a minimum and the pressure is actually atmospheric. This point is significant because it affects the discharge coefficient, which is used to adjust the theoretical discharge rate to account for losses. The discharge coefficient, therefore, indirectly accounts for the effects of the vena contracta on the flow through the orifice."}, {"question": "How does the size of the orifice and the surface area of the pool influence the flow rate, according to the continuity equation?", "answer": "The continuity equation implies that the flow rate through the orifice is influenced by the size of the orifice (A2) and the surface area of the pool (A1). Given that A1 is very large relative to A2, the velocity V1 is essentially 0, simplifying the equation. This relationship highlights the importance of the orifice size in determining the flow rate, as the pool's large surface area minimizes its impact on the velocity."}, {"question": "In the context of the cofferdam scenario, why is the discharge rate from the river into the construction site calculated using the orifice equation, and what assumptions are made?", "answer": "The discharge rate is calculated using the orifice equation because the hole in the cofferdam acts as an orifice, allowing water from the river to flow into the site. The calculation assumes a discharge coefficient of 0.6, which accounts for losses not considered in the basic orifice equation. This assumption simplifies the calculation but may not fully capture the complexities of the flow, such as potential variations in the river stage or the geometry of the hole."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using an estimated discharge coefficient in calculating the volume of leaked petroleum, and how might this affect the environmental report?", "answer": "Using an estimated discharge coefficient can introduce uncertainty into the calculation of the leaked petroleum volume. This uncertainty might affect the accuracy of the environmental report, potentially leading to underestimation or overestimation of the spill's impact. The report's conclusions and recommendations could be influenced by the estimated volume, highlighting the importance of accurately determining the discharge coefficient and considering factors that might affect the flow rate."}, {"question": "How does the orifice equation account for the energy losses that occur during the flow through the orifice, and what are the limitations of this approach?", "answer": "The orifice equation accounts for energy losses through the discharge coefficient (Cd), which adjusts the theoretical discharge rate to reflect actual conditions. However, this approach has limitations, as it simplifies the complex flow dynamics and assumes a constant coefficient. In reality, energy losses can vary due to factors like the orifice's geometry, the flow's velocity, and the presence of obstacles, which might not be fully captured by a single discharge coefficient."}, {"question": "In what scenarios would the orifice equation be applicable, and what are the key factors to consider when applying this equation?", "answer": "The orifice equation"}]}

{"paragraph": "8.5 DESIGN OF PAVEMENT DRAINAGE INLETS The design of drainage inlets is another example where peak discharge estimates are required. A complete discussion of their design is beyond the scope of the presentation in this section be- cause of the large number of both the types of inlets and the factors that affect their sizing. In- lets for drainage from streets and highways, parking areas, and airport facilities can be divided into three major groups: curb-opening, gutter, and combination inlets; these are shown in Fig- ure 8-6. Slotted drain inlets are an alternative for some drainage problems (see Section 8.6). Factors that are considered in the design of inlets include the following: 1. The physical characteristics of the grate (length, width, and for inlets with curb open- ings, the height of the opening 2. The type of grate (parallel bar, curved vane, tilt bar, and reticuline), which are shown in Figure 8-7 3. The physical characteristics of the surface generating the flow to the grate (longitudi- nal and cross-section slopes, length, roughness) 4. The allowable spread, which is the proportion of a roadway cross section or traffic lane that the drainage policy allows to be covered by water 5. The return period of the design, which is also set by policy (a (b) (c) FIGURE 8-6 Views of pavement drainage inlets: (a) grate inlet; (b) curb-opening inlet; and (c) combination inlet.

The required efficiency of the grate, which is the proportion of the total flow inter- cepted by the inlet for a specific set of conditions (the portion of the flow that is not i ~ . - tercepted is termed the carryover flow) When using the weir equation for inlet evaluation, the perimeter of the grate inlet or the length of the curb opening can be used for L in Equation 8-24. When using Equation 8-16 for inlet evaluation the open area of the grate can be used as A; for a submerged curb- opening inlet, the area of the opening can be used as A, as long as the flow through the inlet facility does not have a control section elsewhere that places a greater limitation on the inter- cepted flow rate. Equations 8-16 and 8-24 represent upper limits on the flow that can be in- tercepted by an inlet. Safety factors are used to reduce the flow computed with these equa- tions to reflect more accurately the amount of flow intercepted. The factors of safety and efficiency typically reduce the intercepted flow rate from 50 to 80% of the rates computed with Equations 8-16 and 8-24. Example 8-7 Consider the case of a curb inlet that has a length of 14 ft. The relationship between the flow rate and depth is given by in which f is a factor of safety. The relationship of Equation 8-25 is shown in Figure 8-8 for fac- tors of safety of 0.5, 0.67, and 0.8, as well as the theoretical discharge (that is,f= 1). For exam- ple, the capacity for the inlet, assuming that Equation 8-24 applies with no factor of safety, would be 7.1 ft3/sec for a depth of 0.3 ft. If a factor of safety of 0.8 applied, the actual inlet flow rate would be 5.6 ft3/sec. Only 3.6 ft3/sec would enter if the factor of safety was 0.5. Example 8-8 In Example 7-1 1, the initial subarea generated a peak discharge of 5.7 ft?/sec. Assuming that this is divided equally into two inlets, Equation 8-24, with a factor of safety applied, can be used to size the inlets. Both inlets will be sized to handle a discharge of 2.85 ft?/sec and limit the spread Sec. 8.5 Design of Pavement Drainage Inlets FIGURE 8-8 Depth-discharge rela- 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 tionships for grate inlet and selected 0.

Assuming a cross slope of 0.5 in./ft, the relationship T = zd, where z is the reciprocal of the cross slope, can be used to solve for the allowable depth: d = T/z = 5/24 = 0.208 ft. Assum- ing a loss coefficient C, of 3.1 and a factor of safety of 0.75, the required length of the inlet is Example 8-9 An on-grade grate inlet (see Figure 8-6a) has a grate with 18 openings, each with a length of 2.3 ft and a width of 0.12 ft. The design depth of submergence is 6 in., and a discharge coeffi- cient of 0.6 is assumed. If the design is intended to intercept 75% of the flow, the discharge that passes into the grate is Example 8-10 The Rational Formula was used to compute a design discharge of 4.3 ft3/sec for an inlet. If a grate inlet is to be used with a design depth of 4 in., the grate opening area is If each opening is 1.8 ft in length and 0.12 ft wide, the grate will need n openings: Thus, eight openings will be needed to accommodate the design discharge. 430 Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of pavement drainage inlets, what factors are considered in their design?", "answer": "The design of inlets considers factors including the physical characteristics of the grate, the type of grate, the physical characteristics of the surface generating the flow, the allowable spread, the return period of the design, and the required efficiency of the grate."}, {"question": "How do safety factors influence the flow rate intercepted by an inlet, and why are they used?", "answer": "Safety factors reduce the flow computed with equations like 8-16 and 8-24 to reflect more accurately the amount of flow intercepted. They are used because the theoretical discharge rates calculated by these equations represent upper limits on the flow that can be intercepted, and applying safety factors helps to account for real-world inefficiencies and limitations, thereby ensuring that the design is more reliable and safe. For example, factors of safety typically reduce the intercepted flow rate from 50 to 80% of the rates computed with these equations, which means that the actual flow rate an inlet can handle is significantly lower than its theoretical capacity."}, {"question": "In the design of pavement drainage inlets, why is the type of grate considered an important factor?", "answer": "The type of grate is considered an important factor because different grate configurations (such as parallel bar, curved vane, tilt bar, and reticuline) have different efficiencies and capacities for intercepting flow. The choice of grate type affects how much of the total flow is intercepted by the inlet and how much is carried over, which in turn impacts the overall performance and safety of the drainage system."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of using equations like 8-16 and 8-24 in the evaluation of inlet performance, and how do they relate to the actual flow intercepted?", "answer": "Equations like 8-16 and 8-24 are used to estimate the upper limit of the flow that can be intercepted by an inlet. However, these equations provide theoretical discharge rates, and the actual flow intercepted is typically lower due to factors such as inefficiencies in the grate design and operational conditions. Therefore, safety factors are applied to these calculated rates to obtain a more realistic estimate of the inlet's capacity, ensuring that the design can handle the expected flow without overflowing or causing safety issues."}, {"question": "How does the allowable spread influence the design of pavement drainage inlets, and what are its implications for drainage policy?", "answer": "The allowable spread, which is the proportion of a roadway cross section or traffic lane that the drainage policy allows to be covered by water, directly influences the design of inlets by determining the maximum amount of water that can be allowed to accumulate before it is considered a safety hazard. This, in turn, affects the sizing and capacity of the inlets, as they must be able to handle the flow without exceeding the allowable spread. The implications for drainage policy are significant, as it must balance the need for efficient drainage with safety considerations, ensuring that the design standards for inlets are stringent enough to prevent hazardous conditions while also being practical and cost-effective."}, {"question": "In the context of inlet design, what is the significance of the return period, and how does it relate to the design process?", "answer": "The return period, which is set by policy, signifies the frequency at which a certain design storm is expected to occur. It is crucial in the design process because it determines the magnitude of the flow that the inlet must be able to handle. A longer return period implies a more significant design storm and, consequently, a larger required capacity for the inlet. This means that the design must consider not only the average or typical flow conditions but also the potential for more extreme events, ensuring that the drainage system can safely manage these higher flows without failing or causing damage."}, {"question": "Why are factors of safety applied to the theoretical discharge rates calculated by equations like 8-16 and 8-24, and what are the typical reductions in flow rate?", "answer": "Factors of safety are applied to account for the real-world inefficiencies and limitations of the inlet design, ensuring that the actual flow rate the inlet can handle is not overestimated. Typically, these factors reduce the intercepted flow rate from 50 to 80% of the theoretical rates calculated by the equations, indicating that the actual capacity of an inlet is significantly lower than its theoretical maximum. This reduction is critical for ensuring the reliability and safety of the drainage system under various flow conditions."}, {"question": "How does the required efficiency of the grate influence the design of pavement drainage inlets, and what does it signify?", "answer": "The required efficiency of the grate, which is the proportion of the total flow intercepted by the inlet, directly influences the design by determining how effectively the inlet must capture the flow. A higher required efficiency means that the inlet must be designed to capture a larger proportion of the flow, which can impact the size, type, and configuration of the grate. This efficiency is crucial because it signifies the inlet's ability"}]}
{"paragraph": "8.6 SLOlI In addition to the inlet configurations discussed in the preceding section, drainage from im- pervious surfaces such as highways, parking lots, and large sports complexes can be con- trolled with slotted drains. Figure 8-9 shows a schematic of a slotted drain inlet designed for a highway section. Two design situations will be discussed, installation on grade and instal- lation in sag. Data required to compute the length of the slotted drain, which is one of the de- sign variables, are the longitudinal slope S (ft/ft), the cross slope S, (ft/ft), the information necessary to compute discharge rates, the design return period, the surface roughness n, and the allowable carryover efficiency for installation on grade. The procedure for designing a slotted drain to be installed on grade is as follows: 1. Compute the discharge rate for the section extending to the previous drain using a method such as the Rational Formula or with one of the equations given in Figure 8-3. 2. Compute the design discharge qd (ft3/sec) as the sum of the discharge computed in Step 1 and any carryover flow q, not intercepted by an up-gradient inlet. 3.

Compute the design length Ld by 6. Compute the depth flow and required curb height using the equations of Figure 8-3. For slotted drain inlets installed in sag locations, carryover and ponding are not accept- able for the design return period. For a flow depth of 0.2 ft or less, the inlet operates accord- ing to the weir equation. For depths greater than 0.4 ft, the inlet operates as an orifice. In the transition stage, between 0.2 and 0.4 ft, it is reasonable to assume that the inlet operates as an orifice. For orificial flow the discharge rate into the slotted drain is in which q is the discharge rate (ft3/sec), Cd is the loss coefficient, L is the length of the slot- ted drain (ft), W is the width of the slotted drain (ft), and d is the depth of the inflow (ft) at the design discharge. The value of the loss coefficient Cd depends on the depth of the water and the length and width of the slot; typical values range from 0.6 to 1. O. A value of 0.8 will be used herein. The required length of the slotted drain inlet can be determined by transform- ing Equation 8-30: A width of 1.75 in. is common, and for Cd equal to 0.8, Equation 8-3 1 reduces to Equation 8-32 is valid for Cd = 0.8; however, for Cd = 0.6, which is also commonly used, the coefficient of Equation 8-32 would be 1.4 rather than 1.07. For computing the required length of the slotted drain installed in sag, follow these steps: 1. Compute the discharge, including any carryover from up-gradient inlets, that the inlet is required to control. 2. Determine the depth of flow for this discharge using the formulas of Figure 8-3. 3. Compute the required length using either Equation 8-3 1 or 8-32. Example 8-11 A section of highway is shown in Figure 8-10 for which drainage will be provided using slotted drain. Discharge rates will be computed using the Rational Method with C = 0.8 and i = 9 in./hr. For a 300-ft length of roadway and a width for the roadway and shoulder of 28 ft, the drainage area is 0.193 acre, which yields a discharge of 1.39 ft3/sec.

If a design efficiency of 80% is permitted, the carryover reduction factor can be computed using Equation 8-28b: Thus, the design length (Equation 8-29) is Assuming a triangular-shaped gutter, the depth of flow and the spread can be determined from Figure 8-3: The runoff will have a depth of slightly more than 2 in. and the spread will cover less than one- half of the width of the shoulder, which is 10 ft wide. If the inlet intercepts 80% of the flow, the carryover discharge is 0.28 ftvsec. The second inlet must drain 300 ft of roadway and shoulder as well as the carryover flow of 0.28 ft3/sec. Thus, the total discharge is 1.67 ft3/sec. Using Equation 8-27 the initial drain length is Equation 8-28b can be used to compute the carryover reduction factor, which is 0.56 for Ed = 80%. The design length is 11.5 ft. The depth of flow (6)a nd spread (73 are = Set. 8.7 Culvert Design If the inlet intercepts 80% of the flow, the carryover discharge is 0.33 ft3/sec. For the remaining 400-ft length of highway, the Rational Method gives a discharge rate of 1.85 ft3/sec. Adding a carryover flow of 0.33 ft3/sec yields a flow of 2.1 8 ft3/sec. Since the high- way has two sections entering the sag, each with a flow of 2.18 ft3/sec, the drain at the sag must intercept 4.36 ft3/sec. Using Figure 8-3, the depth of flow is The required length of the slotted drain in the sag can be estimated using Equation 8-32: L = 1.07 (4.36) (0.283)-~.=~ 8.7 ft (8-42) Given that both lanes of the highway cross section are the same, the same lengths of slotted in- lets will be used on each side of the highway.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}, {"question": "In the context of slotted drain inlet design, what are the primary factors that influence the computation of the length of the slotted drain?", "answer": "The primary factors that influence the computation of the length of the slotted drain include the longitudinal slope, cross slope, information necessary to compute discharge rates, design return period, surface roughness, and the allowable carryover efficiency for installation on grade."}, {"question": "How do designers determine the required length of a slotted drain inlet installed in sag locations, and what are the key considerations for this process?", "answer": "Designers determine the required length of a slotted drain inlet installed in sag locations by first computing the discharge, including any carryover from up-gradient inlets, that the inlet is required to control. Then, they determine the depth of flow for this discharge using the formulas provided. The key consideration is that carryover and ponding are not acceptable for the design return period, and the inlet's operation as a weir or orifice, depending on the flow depth, significantly affects the computation. For depths greater than 0.4 ft, the inlet operates as an orifice, and the discharge rate into the slotted drain can be calculated using the orifice equation, which takes into account the loss coefficient, length, width, and depth of the inflow."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the design efficiency and carryover reduction factor in slotted drain inlet design, and how do these factors impact the design length?", "answer": "Considering the design efficiency and carryover reduction factor is essential because they directly impact the design length of the slotted drain. The design efficiency, which is the fraction of the flow that the policy requires to be intercepted, influences the carryover reduction factor. This factor, in turn, affects the design length, as a higher carryover reduction factor results in a shorter design length. The carryover reduction factor can be computed using equations that relate it to the design efficiency, and this computation is critical for determining the appropriate design length to ensure that the slotted drain can effectively manage the runoff without causing carryover or ponding."}, {"question": "In the context of slotted drain inlet design for highways, how do the Rational Method and the equations given in Figure 8-3 contribute to the design process, and what are their limitations?", "answer": "The Rational Method and the equations given in Figure 8-3 are used to compute discharge rates and determine the depth of flow and spread of the runoff. The Rational Method, with parameters such as runoff coefficient and rainfall intensity, helps calculate the discharge rate. The equations in Figure 8-3 then allow designers to find the depth of flow and the spread of the runoff, which are crucial for determining the required length of the slotted drain and ensuring that it can handle the runoff without causing erosion or flooding. However, these methods have limitations, such as assuming a triangular-shaped gutter and relying on empirical equations that might not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a slotted drain inlet with a design efficiency of 80%, and how does this efficiency impact the carryover discharge and the required length of the slotted drain?", "answer": "Using a slotted drain inlet with a design efficiency of 80% means that 20% of the flow will be carried over to the next inlet. This carryover discharge must be accounted for in the design of subsequent inlets. The design efficiency of 80% impacts the carryover reduction factor, which in turn affects the required length of the slotted drain. A higher design efficiency would result in a shorter required length, as more of the flow is intercepted. However, achieving higher efficiencies may require longer slotted drains or more frequent inlets, which can have cost and practicality implications."}, {"question": "How does the operation of a slotted drain inlet as a weir or orifice affect its design and performance, and what are the critical flow depths that distinguish between these two modes of operation?", "answer": "The operation of a slotted drain inlet as a weir or orifice significantly affects its design and performance. For flow depths of 0.2 ft or less, the inlet operates according to the weir equation, while for depths greater than 0.4 ft, it operates as an orifice. The transition stage between 0.2 and 0.4 ft is assumed to operate as an orifice. This distinction is critical because the equations used to calculate the discharge rate into the slotted drain differ between weir and orifice flow, with the orifice equation requiring the loss coefficient, length, width, and depth of the inflow. Accurate determination of the flow depth and the corresponding mode of operation is essential for proper design and to ensure the slotted drain can effectively manage runoff."}]}
{"paragraph": "8.7 CULVERT DESIGN Culverts are a common hydraulic structure. As such, there are highway design manuals that are devoted entirely to the wide range of possible culverts. A few basic concepts will be pre- sented here, with the details of design, as well as graphical design aids, left to the design manuals. A culvert is a pipe or box that is located under a roadway, embankment, or service area to allow the passage of storm runoff. While culverts are often circular pipes made of either concrete or corrugated metal, other shapes including elliptical and arch pipes and rectangular box culverts are widely used. A culvert consists of an inlet structure, the pipe or box, and an outlet structure that includes a device to dissipate the energy of the water before it is dis- charged downstream. In some cases, the inlet structure may include a trash rack to prevent debris from entering the pipe barrel and/or an anti-vortex device to ensure maximum hy- draulic efficiency. In addition to the shape, culverts are also classified according to the flow conditions at the inlet and outlet of the structure.

The classification into four categories (unsubmerged inlet and outlet, submerged inlet with unsubmerged outlet and partially full or full pipe, and submerged inlet and outlet) helps in applying appropriate design procedures for each scenario. This categorization is crucial for ensuring the efficient and safe passage of storm runoff."}, {"question": "What components make up a typical culvert structure, and what is their purpose?", "answer": "A typical culvert structure consists of an inlet structure, the pipe or box, and an outlet structure. The inlet structure may include a trash rack to prevent debris from entering the pipe and an anti-vortex device for maximum hydraulic efficiency. The outlet structure includes a device to dissipate the energy of the water before it is discharged downstream, preventing erosion and ensuring the water is safely released."}, {"question": "How do inlet structures contribute to the overall efficiency and safety of culverts?", "answer": "Inlet structures contribute significantly to the efficiency and safety of culverts by incorporating features such as trash racks and anti-vortex devices. Trash racks prevent debris from entering the pipe, which could cause blockages or damage, while anti-vortex devices ensure maximum hydraulic efficiency by preventing the formation of vortices that could reduce flow rates or cause structural issues."}, {"question": "In the context of culvert design procedures, why are there different procedures for different flow conditions?", "answer": "There are different design procedures for different flow conditions because each condition presents unique challenges and requirements. For instance, a submerged inlet with an unsubmerged outlet requires considerations different from those for an unsubmerged inlet and outlet. The varying flow conditions necessitate tailored design approaches to ensure that the culvert functions as intended, safely conveying storm runoff without causing erosion or damage."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the outlet structure in a culvert, and how does it impact downstream areas?", "answer": "The outlet structure in a culvert is designed to dissipate the energy of the water before it is discharged downstream. This is crucial because high-energy water discharge can cause erosion and damage to the downstream area. By dissipating this energy, the outlet structure helps in preventing such negative impacts, ensuring that the water is released safely into the environment without causing harm to the surrounding landscape or infrastructure."}, {"question": "How does the classification of culverts based on flow conditions impact the design process?", "answer": "The classification of culverts based on flow conditions significantly impacts the design process by guiding the selection of appropriate design procedures. Each category of flow condition (unsubmerged inlet and outlet, submerged inlet with unsubmerged outlet and partially full or full pipe, and submerged inlet and outlet) has its specific design considerations and requirements. This classification system ensures that designers can apply the most suitable design methods for the specific conditions of the culvert, leading to more effective and safe culvert designs."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, why is it important to consider the shape and material of culverts?", "answer": "Considering the shape and material of culverts is important in hydrologic design because these factors influence the hydraulic efficiency, durability, and overall performance of the culvert. Different shapes and materials can affect the flow rate, pressure, and resistance within the culvert, which in turn impact its ability to convey storm runoff effectively. Moreover, the choice of material can influence the culvert's resistance to corrosion, abrasion, and other forms of degradation, affecting its lifespan and maintenance requirements."}, {"question": "How do anti-vortex devices in inlet structures enhance the hydraulic efficiency of culverts?", "answer": "Anti-vortex devices in inlet structures enhance the hydraulic efficiency of culverts by preventing the formation of vortices at the inlet. Vortices can reduce the flow rate into the culvert, leading to inefficiencies and potential structural issues. By preventing these vortices, anti-vortex devices ensure that water enters the culvert smoothly and at a maximum rate, thereby enhancing the overall hydraulic efficiency of the structure."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not including a trash rack in a culvert's inlet structure?", "answer": "Not including a trash rack in a culvert's inlet structure can have significant implications, including the potential for debris to enter and block the pipe, which can lead to reduced"}]}

A rougher pipe surface (higher roughness coefficient) increases the resistance to flow, requiring a larger diameter to achieve the desired flow rate. This is critical in ensuring that the culvert can efficiently handle the runoff without causing undue resistance or potential blockages."}, {"question": "How does the layout of the pipe network, as determined by the watershed outlet, impact the design of individual pipes?", "answer": "The layout of the pipe network, including the location of the watershed outlet, impacts the design by determining the flow paths and, consequently, the discharges and required diameters of individual pipes. The design must ensure that the pipe network can efficiently direct the runoff to the outlet, which in this case requires a 30-in. pipe under Main Street. This highlights the importance of considering the overall network layout in the design process."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a pipe with a diameter smaller than the required diameter for the flow conditions?", "answer": "Using a pipe with a diameter smaller than required can lead to insufficient capacity to handle the runoff, potentially causing overflow, erosion, or damage to the culvert and surrounding structures. It is essential to accurately calculate the required diameter based on the expected flow conditions to avoid such issues. In contrast, using a larger diameter than necessary may not be cost-effective but ensures the culvert can handle the design flow without issues."}, {"question": "In the context of hydraulic routing methods, how does the presence of a free surface in unsubmerged inlet and outlet scenarios affect the choice of method?", "answer": "The presence of a free surface allows for the use of simpler hydraulic routing methods, such as Manning's Equation, for estimating the diameter of the culvert. This is because the free surface enables the calculation of flow rates and velocities based on the characteristics of the flow and the pipe, without the need for more complex methods that account for pressurized flow conditions."}]}

The design discharge is 40 ft3/sec, and a discharge coefficient of 0.6 is assumed. Thus, Equation 8-50 becomes The fifth-order polynomial is easily solved using a numerical scheme such as Newton's method. There are two real, positive roots: 2.185 and 11.989 ft. Since the latter is not realistic, a diameter of 2.185 ft is used. A pipe smaller than this will restrict the flow, thus causing a head greater than the design value of 6 ft. Thus, the diameter is set as the next larger commercially available size, which would be 27 in. This will allow a slightly greater discharge than 40 ft3/sec.

If the pipe diameter is too small, it will restrict the flow, leading to a head greater than the design value. By selecting a slightly larger diameter, the culvert can accommodate the design discharge and any potential fluctuations, providing a safety margin against flooding or other issues."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the hydrostatic head and the discharge in culvert design, and how does this relationship impact the design process?", "answer": "The hydrostatic head and the discharge are related through the equation q = C_d * A * sqrt(2 * g * h), where the discharge is proportional to the square root of the hydrostatic head. This relationship means that as the hydrostatic head increases, the discharge also increases.

{"paragraph": "8.7.3 Submerged Inlet and Outlet The third case is treated as a special case of the fourth case, specifically where the depth of flow at the outlet equals the pipe diameter. Thus, the development of the case for a sub- merged inlet and outlet will be presented briefly. The energy equation between points on the headwater and tailwater surfaces is in which pi is the pressure at point i, Vi is the flow velocity at point i, zi is the water surface elevation at point i, and h, is the total head loss. If the surface areas of the headwater and tail- water ponds are large, then the velocities V, and V2 can be considered negligible. The pres- sures are assumed to be hydrostatic: hi = p/y where hi is the elevation above the pipe invert. The invert elevation at the downstream end of the pipe is assumed to be the datum, thus z2 = 0. For a pipe of length L laid at a slope of So, the invert at the inlet will be z, = S&. Thus, Equation 8-52 becomes which transforms to the following expression for h,: The head losses include entrance and exit losses and friction losses along the interior of the pipe barrel. The entrance and exit losses are computed as minor losses, which are a function of the velocity head ~ ~wh1ere V2 is t~he v elocity of the flow in the pipe.

{"paragraph": "8.8 ESTIMATING DETENTION BASIN VOLUMES It is widely recognized that land development, especially in urban areas, is responsible for sig- nificant changes in runoff characteristics. Within the context of the hydrologic cycle of Chap ter 1, especially Figures 1-1 and 1-2, land development decreases the natural storage of a wa- tershed. The removal of trees and vegetation reduces the volume of interception storage. Grading of the site reduces the volume of depression storage and often decreases the perme- ability of the surface soil layer, which reduces infiltration rates and the potential for storage of rainfall in the soil matrix. In urban areas, increased impervious cover also reduces the potential for infiltration and soil storage of rainwater. This reduction of natural storage (that is, intercep tion, depression, and soil storage) causes changes in runoff characteristics. Specifically, both the total volume and the peak of the surface (or direct) storm runoff increase. The loss of nat- ural storage also causes changes in the timing of runoff, specifically a decrease in both the time to peak and the time of concentration. Runoff velocities are increased, which can increase sur- face rill and gully erosion rates (see Chapter 15). Higher stream velocities may also increase rates of bed-load movement. Land development is often accompanied by changes to drainage patterns and channel characteristics. For example, channels may be cleared of vegetation and straightened, with some also being lined with concrete or riprap. Modifications to the channel may result in decreases in channel storage and roughness, both of which can increase flow ve- locities and the potential for flooding at locations downstream from the developing area. Recognizing the potential effects of these changes in runoff characteristics on the in- habitants of the local community, various measures have been proposed to offset these re- ductions in natural storage. The intent of storm water management (SWM) is to mitigate the hydrologic impacts of this lost natural storage, usually using manmade storage. Although a variety of SWM alternatives have been proposed, the storm water management basin re- mains the most popular. The SWM basin is frequently referred to as a detention or retention basin, depending on its effects on the inflow hydrograph. For our purpose, the terms will be used interchangeably because the fundamental concepts for estimating volumes to control discharge rates are the same.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of land development, how does the removal of trees and vegetation affect the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The removal of trees and vegetation reduces the volume of interception storage, which is a component of natural storage that helps regulate runoff characteristics."}, {"question": "Why does land development lead to changes in runoff characteristics, specifically in terms of total volume and peak of surface storm runoff?", "answer": "Land development decreases the natural storage of a watershed by reducing interception, depression, and soil storage, causing an increase in both the total volume and the peak of the surface storm runoff.

{"paragraph": "8.8.1 SWM Policy Considerations To mitigate the detrimental effects of land development, SWM policies have been adopted with the intent of limiting peak flow rates from developed areas to that which occurred prior to development. In addition to specifying the conditions under which SWM methods must be Sec. 8.8 Estimating Detention Basin Volumes 439 used, these policies indicate the intent of SWM. Specifically, the intent of many SWM poli- cies is to limit runoff characteristics after development to those that existed prior to develop- ment. Ths intent can be interpreted to mean that the flood frequency curve for the after- development conditions coincides with the curve for the before-development conditions. However, policy statements usually specify one or two exceedence frequencies (that is, return periods) at which the after-development peak rate must not exceed the before-development peak rate for the same exceedence frequency. Such policies often use return periods of 2, 10, or 100 years as the target points on the frequency curve. Where channel erosion is of primary concern, a smaller return period such as the 6-month event may serve as the target event. Policies should also specify a specific design method to be used in the design of a SWM con- trol method.

By standardizing the design approach, it becomes easier to compare and evaluate the performance of various SWM control methods, which can lead to improvements in stormwater management practices over time."}, {"question": "In the context of channel erosion, how do SWM policies adapt their target events?", "answer": "Where channel erosion is of primary concern, SWM policies may use a smaller return period, such as the 6-month event, as the target event. This adaptation reflects the need to manage more frequent, smaller-scale events that can significantly impact channel stability and erosion rates. By focusing on these events, SWM policies can help mitigate the risk of channel erosion and protect waterways from the detrimental effects of increased runoff due to land development."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the flood frequency curve for before-development and after-development conditions, as intended by SWM policies?", "answer": "The intent of many SWM policies is for the flood frequency curve for the after-development conditions to coincide with the curve for the before-development conditions. This means that the policies aim to maintain the same flood frequency characteristics before and after development, ensuring that the development does not increase the risk of flooding."}, {"question": "How do SWM policies balance the need for development with the need to protect water resources?", "answer": "SWM policies balance the need for development with the need to protect water resources by setting specific limits on peak flow rates and runoff characteristics after development. These limits are designed to prevent the degradation of water quality and the increase of flood risks, thereby protecting water resources while still allowing for controlled development. This balance is crucial for sustainable development and environmental protection, as it ensures that economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental degradation."}, {"question": "In the context of SWM policy implementation, what challenges might arise from the lack of data on the effectiveness of different design methods?", "answer": "The lack of data on the effectiveness of different design methods can pose a challenge for SWM policy implementation, as it makes it difficult to determine the most effective approach. This challenge can lead to inconsistencies in design practices and potentially undermine the effectiveness of SWM policies. Furthermore, the absence of comprehensive data can hinder the evaluation and improvement of SWM control methods, making it essential to prioritize research and data collection to support informed decision-making in stormwater management."}, {"question": "Why is design consistency important in the implementation of SWM policies?", "answer": "Design consistency is important in the implementation of SWM policies because it ensures that all development projects adhere to the same standards and guidelines, making it easier to evaluate and compare their performance. Consistency in design also facilitates the identification of best practices and areas for improvement, ultimately contributing to more effective stormwater management. Moreover, design consistency helps in maintaining public trust and confidence in the ability of SWM policies to protect water resources and mitigate the impacts of land development."}, {"question": "How do SWM policies address the issue of peak flow rates in developed areas?", "answer": "SWM policies address the issue of peak flow rates in developed areas by limiting them to the rates that occurred prior to development. This is achieved by specifying conditions under which SWM methods must be used and by setting targets for peak flow rates based on exceedence frequencies or return periods. By controlling peak flow rates, SWM policies aim to reduce the risk of flooding and erosion in developed areas, thereby protecting both human settlements and the environment."}, {"question": "What is the significance of return periods in SWM policies?", "answer": "Return periods, such as 2, 10, or 100 years, are significant in SWM policies because they serve as target points on the flood frequency curve. These periods are used to specify the conditions under which the after-development peak rate must not exceed the before-development peak rate, ensuring that development does not increase flood risk. The choice of return period reflects the level of flood protection desired and the acceptable level of risk, making return periods a critical"}]}
{"paragraph": "8.8.2 Elements of SWM Structures Figure 8-12 shows a schematic of the cross section of a detention basin with a single-stage riser. A pool is formed behind the detention structure. The flood runoff enters the pool at the upper end of the detention basin. Water can be discharged from the pool through a pipe that passes through or around the detention structure. The invert elevation of the riser can serve to limit the outflow rate, thus forming a permanent pool, with the permanent pool elevation changing only through evaporation and infiltration losses. The use of a permanent pool has a number of advantages, including water quality control, aesthetic considerations, and wildlife habitat improvement. Of course, a permanent pool also increases the total storage volume, which requires both a larger retaining structure and a larger commitment of land, both of which increase the cost of the project. Storage below the riser invert elevation is sometimes referred to as dead storage. Storage allocated for flood runoff is referred to as active storage. Figure 8-12 does not show several other elements of detention basin design. The riser inlet should be fitted with both an antivortex device and a trash rack. The anti-vortex device prevents the formation of a vortex, thus maintaining the hydraulic efficiency of the outlet structure. The trash rack prevents trash (and people) from being sucked into the riser by high-velocity flows. At least one antiseep collar is fitted to the outside of the discharge pipe to prevent erosion about the pipe within the retaining structure. All detention basins should have an emergency spillway to pass runoff from very large flood events, so the detention structure is not overtopped and washed out. The elevation of the bottom of the emergency spillway, which will pass high flows around the retaining structure, is above the elevation of the riser outlet but below the top of the retaining structure. n Flood runoff / + R etaining structuri Detention Dry weather elevation discharge FIGURE 8-12 Schematic cross section storage Riser of a detention basin with a single-stage Outlet riser.

Additionally, the increased land commitment may limit the availability of land for other uses, making the project more complex and potentially contentious."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin operation, why is it necessary to have an emergency spillway?", "answer": "An emergency spillway is necessary to pass runoff from very large flood events, preventing the detention structure from being overtopped and washed out. This is crucial because if the structure is overtopped, it can lead to catastrophic failure, causing damage to the surrounding area and potentially endangering lives. The emergency spillway provides a safe and controlled way to release excess water, protecting the structure and the surrounding environment."}, {"question": "What is the difference between dead storage and active storage in a detention basin?", "answer": "Dead storage refers to the storage below the riser invert elevation, while active storage is the storage allocated for flood runoff.

This design ensures that the emergency spillway only activates during extreme flood events, allowing the detention basin to function normally during smaller events, and preventing the structure from being overtopped."}, {"question": "In the context of water quality control, what advantage does a permanent pool in a detention basin provide?", "answer": "A permanent pool in a detention basin provides an advantage in water quality control. The pool can help to settle out sediments and pollutants, improving the water quality of the discharged water. Additionally, the permanent pool can also support aquatic life, further enhancing the water quality benefits."}, {"question": "Why is it important to fit the discharge pipe with at least one antiseep collar in a detention basin?", "answer": "Fitting the discharge pipe with at least one antiseep collar is important to prevent erosion around the pipe within the retaining structure.

The permanent pool can create a visually appealing landscape feature, enhancing the aesthetic value of the area. Additionally, the pool can provide a habitat for wildlife, supporting biodiversity and ecosystem health. However, the creation of a permanent pool also requires careful consideration of the potential impacts on the surrounding environment and the need for ongoing maintenance to ensure the pool remains a beneficial feature."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin design, what is the purpose of the invert elevation of the riser?", "answer": "The invert elevation of the riser serves to limit the outflow rate, thus forming a permanent pool, with the permanent pool elevation changing only through evaporation and infiltration losses.

{"paragraph": "8.8.3 Analysis Versus Synthesis The problem of analysis versus synthesis is best evaluated in terms of systems theory (see Figure 1-3). The problem is viewed in terms of the input (inflow runoff hydrograph), output (outflow hydrograph), and the transfer function (stage storage-discharge relationship). In the analysis phase, the two hydrographs would be measured for an existing storm water manage- ment facility, and it would be necessary to calibrate the stage-storage-discharge relationship. While the stage-storage relationship is determined from topography, the stage-discharge re- lationship would have to be analyzed (calibrated). For a given storage facility, the physical characteristics of the outlet facility would be known. Therefore, the analysis would involve determining the best values of the weir andor orifice coefficients for the outlet. Given the cost involved in data collection, analyses are rarely undertaken; therefore, only the synthesis case will be discussed in this chapter. In the synthesis case, the objective is to make estimates of either the outflow hydro- graph or the necessary characteristics of the proposed riser. For watershed studies where de- tention basins exist, it may be necessary to synthesize flood hydrographs for the detention basin outflow; in this case, the outflow hydrograph is estimated from a design storm. The standard procedure is to assume a design storm and a unit hydrograph and convolve the rain- fall excess with the unit hydrograph. The resulting runoff hydrograph is used as the input (in- flow runoff hydrograph). Weir coefficients are assumed along with the linear storage equa- tion to compute the outflow hydrograph. The second case of synthesis, which will be referred to as the problem of design, has the objective of estimating the characteristics of the riserloutlet facility in order to meet some design objective. In this case, the output of the design problem is the area of the orifice or weir length, riser and conduit diameters, and outlet facility elevation characteristics.

By convolving the rainfall excess with the unit hydrograph, the resulting runoff hydrograph can be used as input to estimate the outflow hydrograph, taking into account the detention basin's storage and outlet characteristics. This approach enables designers to predict the outflow hydrograph under various storm conditions, facilitating the design of effective detention basins for storm water management."}, {"question": "Why is the design storm assumption critical in the synthesis case for watershed studies?", "answer": "The design storm assumption is critical because it directly affects the estimation of the outflow hydrograph.

{"paragraph": "8.8.4 Planning versus Design A number of detention basin planning methods for estimating the required volume of deten- tion storage are introduced in this chapter. Methods will be provided for estimating the size of the outlet structure for both single-stage and two-stage risers. The methods of this chapter will be classed as planning methods, although they have been used for design. Design tech- niques differ in two ways from the SWM planning methods. First, the planning methods only require peak discharge estimates, as opposed to requiring entire flood hydrographs. Thus, routing hydrographs through the detention basin is not necessary when using these planning methods. Second, since routing is not required, a stage-storage-discharge relation- ship is not required; instead, the storage-discharge relationship is inherent in the planning methods. The design method introduced in Chapter 11 will use flood hydrographs, routing, and a site-specific stage-storage-discharge relationship. For this reason the design method is more accurate than the planning methods. The terms planning and design are used to distin- guish between approaches to SWM problem solving that reflect differences in expected ac- curacy, as well as the cost and effort involved. The following summarizes the differences be- tween methods: Sec. 8.8 Estimating Detention Basin Volumes 441 Classification: Detention Volume Methods Relative Level Basis Timing Storage Routing Accuracy Use I Volume Not considered Not considered No Low Planning I1 Peak Constant time Generalized No Medium Planning discharge of conc. stage-storage I11 Entire Variable: Site-specific Yes High Design hydro- time vs. stage-storage graph storage The problem of planning the detention facility is separated into two parts: estimating the volume of storage and sizing the characteristics of the outlet facility. In planning they are treated separately, whereas in design their determination is made simultaneously. A number of methods have been proposed and are being used for estimating detention volumes. Recognizing that these methods often yield widely different estimates, a brief com- parison of some of the more widely used methods is in order. A relationship between the ratio of the storage volume to the runoff depth and the ratio of the \"pre-development\" and \"post-development\" peak discharges is the basis for many of these methods. For SWM poli- cies that require the peak discharge released from the SWM basin to be no greater than the pre-development peak discharge, the pre-to-post ratio is often referred to as the ratio of the outflow to inflow since the peak of the outflow from the detention basin equals the pre- development peak discharge, and the inflow to the detention basin equals the post- development peak discharge. An estimate of the required volume of detention storage is necessary in both planning and design. Planning methods are usually based on one or more of the following parameters: 1. a:t he ratio of the peak discharges before development (that is, the peak discharge from the detention facility) and after development 2. y: the ratio of the times to peak for the outflow from and the inflow to the detention fa- cility 3. Q,: the depth (in.) of runoff after development", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of detention basin planning, what are the primary differences between planning and design methods?", "answer": "The primary differences between planning and design methods are that planning methods only require peak discharge estimates and do not necessitate routing hydrographs or a stage-storage-discharge relationship, whereas design methods use flood hydrographs, routing, and a site-specific stage-storage-discharge relationship, making them more accurate."}, {"question": "How do planning methods for estimating detention basin volumes differ from design methods in terms of required data and accuracy?", "answer": "Planning methods differ from design methods in that they only require peak discharge estimates and do not require entire flood hydrographs, resulting in lower accuracy compared to design methods, which use more detailed data and are thus more accurate."}, {"question": "In the context of stormwater management (SWM), why are planning and design methods distinguished based on expected accuracy and the cost and effort involved?", "answer": "Planning and design methods are distinguished based on expected accuracy and the cost and effort involved because they reflect different approaches to SWM problem-solving, with planning methods being less accurate but potentially less costly and time-consuming, and design methods being more accurate but requiring more detailed data and effort. This distinction is important because it allows practitioners to choose the appropriate method based on the specific needs and constraints of their project. Furthermore, understanding the differences between planning and design methods is crucial for effective SWM, as it enables the selection of the most suitable approach for a given scenario, taking into account factors such as the level of accuracy required, the availability of data, and the resources available for the project."}, {"question": "What is the basis for many detention volume estimation methods, and how does it relate to SWM policies?", "answer": "Many detention volume estimation methods are based on the relationship between the ratio of the storage volume to the runoff depth and the ratio of the \"pre-development\" and \"post-development\" peak discharges. This relationship is relevant to SWM policies that require the peak discharge released from the SWM basin to be no greater than the pre-development peak discharge, as it allows for the estimation of the required volume of detention storage to meet these policies. The pre-to-post ratio is often referred to as the ratio of the outflow to inflow, as the peak of the outflow from the detention basin equals the pre-development peak discharge, and the inflow to the detention basin equals the post-development peak discharge. This relationship is critical in SWM, as it provides a basis for estimating the required detention storage volume, which is essential for effective stormwater management and mitigation of potential flood risks."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin planning, how are the volume of storage and the characteristics of the outlet facility determined, and what are the implications of this approach?", "answer": "In planning, the volume of storage and the characteristics of the outlet facility are treated separately, whereas in design, their determination is made simultaneously. This approach has implications for the accuracy and effectiveness of the detention basin, as separate determination may lead to less accurate results compared to simultaneous determination. The separate treatment of storage volume and outlet facility characteristics in planning methods may result in a less optimized design, potentially leading to reduced performance and increased risk of flooding. In contrast, the simultaneous determination of these components in design methods allows for a more integrated and optimized approach, resulting in a more effective and efficient detention basin."}, {"question": "Why are multiple methods proposed for estimating detention volumes, and what are the challenges associated with these methods?", "answer": "Multiple methods are proposed for estimating detention volumes because they often yield widely different estimates, highlighting the complexity and uncertainty associated with detention volume estimation. The challenges associated with these methods include the need for accurate input data, the selection of the most appropriate method for a given scenario, and the potential for significant variations in estimated detention volumes. These challenges underscore the importance of careful consideration and evaluation of the different methods, as well as the need for ongoing research and development to improve the accuracy and reliability of detention volume estimation methods."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin planning, what parameters are planning methods usually based on, and how do they relate to the estimation of required detention storage volume?", "answer": "Planning methods are usually based on one or more of the following parameters: the ratio of the peak discharges before development and after development, the ratio of the times to peak for the outflow from and the inflow to the detention facility, and the depth of runoff after development. These parameters are used to estimate the required volume of detention storage, which is necessary for both planning and design. The ratio of peak discharges, for example, is used to determine the required storage volume to mitigate the increased peak discharge resulting from development, while the ratio of times to peak is used to account for the timing of the outflow and inflow. The depth of runoff after development is also an important parameter, as it affects the overall volume of runoff that needs to be managed."}]}
{"paragraph": "8.8.5 A Generalized Planning Model Before considering the assumptions that are made about the parameters for each method, it is instructive to present a generalized model for relating these parameters. For planning pur- poses it is not unreasonable to use the assumptions that underlie the Rational Method. Specifically, a triangular hydrograph with a time to peak equal to tc and a time base of 2tc is assumed. The peak discharges for the pre- and post-development conditions are denoted as q,, and q,,, respectively; however, the peak discharges do not have to be computed using the Rational Method. They could, for example, be computed using the SCS Graphical Peak Dis- charge Method. The parameters a and y are defined as I Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8 442 L (8-59) tPa In most cases. a will be less than 1 because development causes increases in peak dis- charges, and y will be greater than 1 because development causes decreases in the timing of runoff.

{"paragraph": "8.8.6 The Loss-of-Natural-Storage Method When storm water detention was first proposed as a method for controlling flood runoff, methods for estimating detention volumes were based on the idea that the volume of man- made storage should equal the volume of lost natural storage: in which Qaa nd Q, are the depths (in.) of runoff for the post- and pre-development water- shed conditions. To place Equation 8-64 in a general form, both sides can be divided by Qa and rearranged: The runoff depths Qaa nd Q, can be computed using any one of a number of methods. For the SCS method, the SCS runoff equation (Equation 7 4 2 ) can be used with the post- and pre-development CNs. For the Rational Method, runoff depths (in.) Q can be estimated using the peak discharge qp (ft3/sec), the time of concentration tc (rnin), and the drainage area A (acres): in which the factor 21121 is necessary to convert Q to inches. Equation 8-66 can be used for both the pre- and post-development conditions using the appropriate values of qp and t,. The computations can be made on Worksheet 8-1.

{"paragraph": "8.8.12 Comparison of Planning Methods It is of interest to compare the generalized model with other planning methods. The methods have slightly different input requirements, as is evident from the input summary shown on Worksheet 8-1. The input requirements are usually the same for many of the methods for es- timating peak discharge, as discussed in Chapter 7. The relationship between VIQ, and a provides another means of comparison. To compare the methods, an assumption has to be made about the relationship between the runoff depth and the peak discharge. For purposes of comparison, we can assume that the volume of runoff equals the product of the peak dis- charge and the time of concentration: Q = (2 , tc (8-74) Sec. 8.8 Estimating Detention Basin Volumes 45 1 Substituting Equation 8-74 into the equation for the loss-of-natural-storage method of Equa- tion 8-61 yields in which k is the ratio of the pre- to post-development times of concentration. Assuming that the ratio k equals the value of y yields Since land development usually decreases the time of concentration, y is usually greater than 1.0. The relationship between VJQ, and a is shown in Figure 8-18 for the cases where y equals 1.0 and 1.25. To compare the Rational Formula Hydrograph Method of Equation 8-67 with the other methods, we can divide both sides of Equation 8-67 by Q,, and making use of Equa- tion 8-74 yields Equation 8-77 is shown in Figure 8-1 8 for the cases where k equals 1.O and 1.25. If we assume that the inflow hydrograph for the Abt and Grigg Method is triangular with a time to peak equal to t, and a time base equal to 2t,, Equation 8-69 can be used to give the ratio of the volume of storage to the depth of runoff: This relationship is also shown in Figure 8-18. h. , Eq. 8-77 with k = 1.25 i Y , Eqs. 8-75 and 8-77 with k = 1 FIGURE 8-18 Relationship between the ratio of the volume of storage (V,) to the after-development runoff depth o 0.5 1 (Q,) and the ratio of the pre-develop- - ment (qpb)a nd post-development (qpa) qpb peak discharges. qpa Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8 Based on the assumption that Tb= 2tp, the Wycoff and Singh Method of Equation 8-70 can be used to derive an expression for VJQ,: Example 8-18 Figure 8-19 shows the plot layout for a 250,000-ft2 proposed multi-family housing develop- ment. The site is currently forested (fair condition) on a C soil. In the post-development condi- tion, the pervious portions of the layout will be grass covered (good condition). The impervious portions are as follows: buildings (24,300 ft'), pool area (11,250 ft2), tennis courts (7500 ft2), maintenance shed (500 ft2), parking lots (48,150 ft2), driveways (4500 ft\", and sidewalks (4630 ft2). The total imperviousness is 100,830 ft2, which is 40.33% of the total area of the de- Fl Tennis High-rise Apanment - Grubb Road Feet FIGURE 8-19 Layout of multi-family housing development for after-development condition. Sec. 8.8 Estimating Detention Basin Volumes 453 velopment. The development is adjacent to an existing collector street (Grubb Road) and will be attached to the existing storm drainage system. The local storm drainage policy requires that the 25-yr peak discharge after development not exceed the 25-yr peak discharge for the pre- development conditions. A planning estimate of the volume of detention storage that is required to meet the storm drainage policy can be obtained using any of the previous methods. The SCS method will be used to obtain estimates of the runoff depths and peak discharges. The watershed slope is 5.6%, with an elevation drop of 28 ft over a length of 500 ft. The pre-development peak discharge can be computed using the SCS Graphical Method. For a slope of 5.6% on a forested watershed, the overland flow velocity is 0.6 ftlsec (see Figure 3-19). For a flow length of 500 ft, the velocity method (Equation 343) yields a time of concen- tration of 0.23 1 hr. A CN of 73 is obtained from Table 3-1 8 for a forested watershed in fair con- dition. For a 25-yr return period a 24-hr rainfall intensity of 0.245 in./hr is obtained from Figure 4 4 ; therefore, the 24-hr rainfall volume is 5.9 in. For a CN of 73, Equation 7 4 2 y ields a runoff depth of 3.01 in. For a CN of 73 and a rainfall of 5.9 in., the IJP ratio is 0.12 (Table 7-14). Using the time of concentration and IJP as input to Figure 7-9, the unit peak discharge is 750 ft3/sec/mi2/ino. f runoff. Using Equation 745, the pre-development peak discharge is q,, = (750 ft3/sec/mi2/in.) (0.008968 mi2) (3.01 in.) = 20 ft 3/sec A similar evaluation can be made for the post-development conditions. For a slope of 5.6% on a grassed overland flow area, the runoff velocity is 1.7 ftlsec. For a flow length of 500 ft, the ve- locity method yields a t, of 0.082 hr; it is common practice to use a minimum value, such as 0.1 hr, when the computed t, is less than the minimum. From Table 3-18, CNs of 98 and 74 are ob- tained for the impervious surfaces and grassed areas, respectively; therefore, the weighted CN is An IJP ratio of 0.1 is obtained from Table 7-14. A runoff depth (Q,) of 4.10 in. is obtained using Equation 742. For an I#' of 0.1 and a t, of 0.1 hr, a unit peak discharge of 1048 ft3/sec/mi2/in.i s obtained from Figure 7-9. Using Equation 745, the after-development peak discharge is = (1048 ft3/sec/mi2/in.) (0.008968 mi2) (4.10 in.) ~ P O = 39 ft 3/sec The post-development peak discharge represents a 95% increase in the pre-development peak discharge; therefore, R, equals 0.5 13. Having determined the pre- and post-development discharges and the after-development runoff depth (Q, = 4.10 in.), the value of VJQ, can be computed. Planning estimates of the re- quired storage volumes are given in Table 8-3. The values of VJQ, range from 0.020 to 0.637, with the largest estimate being 32 times greater than the smallest estimate. The depth of storage V, in in. is found by multiplying the VJQ, ratio by the post-development runoff depth of 4.10 in. For a drainage area of 250,000 ft', the required volume of storage would range from 0.038 acre- ft to 1.248 acre-ft. The site drains to the southwest comer of the lot, where there is an area of about 10,000 ft2 that could be used for an on-site detention pond. If the site was excavated to a shallow bottom slope, storage could be provided on-site. Figure 8-20 provides a cross section of the site. For a basin with a bottom area of about 10,000 ft2 the required storage depth would range from 0.164 to 5.44 ft. Four of the methods indicate a depth of less than 2.4 ft, which would be feasible. Two of the methods indicate a required depth from 4 to 5.5 ft; although this is physi- Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8 TABLE 8-3 Alternative Estimates of the Required Detention Storage for the Multifamily Housing Development - -- Estimation 3 v3 vx Method (in.)

Where the storage facility required is not feasible, other forms or sites for detention would be required. As an example, the buildings have a total rooftop area of 24,300 ft'. At a depth of 5 in., rooftop storage could provide 10,125 ft3 of detention storage. This represents a saving of 1 ft of depth in the 10,000 ft2 on-site detention pond. Example 8-19 Development within an 18-acre watershed is planned near a local roadway. A planning estimate of the storage required to detain runoff from a 4-in. storm is needed. The curve number for exist- ing conditions is 70, and development within the watershed will increase the CN to 80. The pre- and post-development times of concentration are 0.55 and 0.37 hr, respectively. The pre- and post-development runoff depths can be obtained from Equation 7-42, with values of 1.33 and 2.04 in., respectively. From Table 7-14 the IJP ratios are 0.21 and 0.13. From Figure 7-9, the unit peak discharges are 450 csdin. and 600 csdin. Thus, the pre-development peak discharge is q,, = 450 (18/640) (1.33) = 16.8 cfs (8-80) The post-development peak discharge is q,, = 600 (18/640) (2.04) = 34.4 cfs (8-8 1) \\ Existing grade [-'\\ I \\ \\ Proposed \\ structure4 ' \\ \\ . \\ \\ '.

The comparison of these methods involves assumptions about the relationship between runoff depth and peak discharge, such as the assumption that the volume of runoff equals the product of the peak discharge and the time of concentration (Q = (2/3)tc). This relationship allows for the comparison of methods like the Rational Formula Hydrograph Method and the loss-of-natural-storage method."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the time of concentration in hydrologic design, and how does land development affect this parameter?", "answer": "The time of concentration is crucial in hydrologic design as it influences the peak discharge and, consequently, the required detention storage. Land development typically decreases the time of concentration, leading to increased peak discharges. This decrease is reflected in the ratio k, which is the ratio of the pre- to post-development times of concentration, often assumed to be equal to the value of y. Understanding this relationship is vital for accurately estimating the required detention storage and designing effective storm drainage systems."}, {"question": "In the context of the SCS method, what factors influence the computation of pre- and post-development peak discharges, and how are these discharges used to determine the required detention storage?", "answer": "The computation of pre- and post-development peak discharges using the SCS method involves factors such as the watershed slope, overland flow velocity, flow length, and curve number (CN). The CN, which depends on the land use and condition, affects the runoff depth and peak discharge. The pre- and post-development peak discharges are then used to determine the discharge ratio R, which, along with the after-development runoff depth (Q,), allows for the computation of the volume ratio R, and subsequently the required detention storage volume V,. This process is critical for planning and designing detention basins that can effectively manage stormwater runoff."}, {"question": "How does the choice of method for estimating detention storage requirements impact the design of storm drainage systems, and what are the implications of underestimating or overestimating these requirements?", "answer": "The choice of method for estimating detention storage requirements significantly impacts the design of storm drainage systems, as different methods can yield a wide range of required storage volumes. Underestimating the storage requirements can lead to inadequate stormwater management, potentially causing flooding and erosion, while overestimating can result in unnecessary costs and land use. The example provided shows that different methods can estimate the required storage volume to range from 0.038 to 1.248 acre-ft, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate method and considering the implications of the estimated storage requirements on the design and functionality of the storm drainage system."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin design, why is it important to consider not just the volume of storage but also the depth and feasibility of the detention pond, and how do these factors influence the overall design?", "answer": "Considering the volume, depth, and feasibility of the detention pond is crucial because while a method may estimate a certain volume of storage, the physical constraints of the site, such as available land and depth limitations, must also be considered. The depth of the detention pond, for instance, affects its feasibility from economic, safety, and aesthetic standpoints. In the example given, some methods indicate a required depth that may not be practical, suggesting the need for alternative solutions, such as rooftop storage, to supplement the detention capacity and make the design more feasible and effective."}, {"question": "What role does the curve number (CN) play in the SCS method for estimating runoff depths and peak discharges, and how does land development affect CN values?", "answer": "The curve number (CN) is a critical parameter in the SCS method, as it influences the estimation of runoff depths and peak discharges. CN values are determined based on the land use and hydrologic condition of the watershed. Land development typically increases the CN value, reflecting a decrease in infiltration and an increase in runoff. For example, the CN changes from 73 for a forested watershed in fair condition to 98 for impervious surfaces and 74 for grassed areas after development, indicating a significant increase in runoff potential due to development."}, {"question": "How do the pre- and post-development times of concentration and the resulting discharge ratios influence the estimation of required detention storage volumes?", "answer": "The pre- and post-development times of concentration are used to calculate the discharge ratio R,, which, along with the after-development runoff depth Q,, is essential for estimating the required detention storage volume V,.

{"paragraph": "8.9 SIZING OF DETENTION BASIN OUTLET STRUCTURES The methods described in Section 8.8 can be used only to estimate the volume of detention storage. The second necessary step in sizing a detention basin is the determination of the physical characteristics of the outlet structure. The outlet may be based on a weir or an ori- fice, or both. Figure 8-12 shows a schematic of a basin with a pipe outlet. In addition to de- termining the diameter of the pipe barrel for a pipe outlet facility, it is also necessary to es- tablish elevations of the pipe inlet and outlet. For those policies that require a permanent pool (wet pond), both the volume of dead storage and the corresponding elevation of the perma- nent pool must be set. Storage volumes computed with the methods of Section 8.8 are active storage estimates, which is added to the dead storage to estimate the total storage. Both the size and effectiveness of a detention basin are largely dependent on the exceedence fre- quency (return period). Studies have shown that a basin designed to control the frequent events (that is. 2- or 5-yr events) will tend to overcontrol the less frequent events (that is, 50- or 100-yr events). Conversely, a basin designed to control the less frequent events will tend to undercontrol the more frequent events. An outlet facility sized to pass the 2-yr event will not allow the 100-yr event to pass with the same speed that a pipe outlet sized for a 100-yr event will pass through; thus, overcontrol results. In the past, most SWM policies have re- quired a single-stage riser. Recently, more enlightened SWM policies have been developed that require two-stage control because of the problems of undercontrol and overcontrol asso- ciated with single-stage risers. The sizing of both single-stage and multi-stage risers will be discussed here. In the sizing of risers, it is necessary to determine both the required volume of storage and the physical characteristics of the riser. The physical characteristics include the outlet pipe diameter, the riser diameter, the length of the weir or the area of the orifice, and the ele- vation characteristics of the riser. Single-stage risers with weir flow and orifice flow are shown in Figures 8-21a and b, respectively. For weir flow control, Equation 8-24 defines the relationship between the discharge (q) and (1) the depth in feet (h)a bove the weir, (2) the discharge or weir coefficient Cw, and (3) the length of the weir L,. Values of Cw depend on the characteristics of both the weir and the discharge rate, with values ranging from 2.6 to 3.3; however, a constant value of about 3.0 is often used. The general formula for flow through an orifice is given by Equation 8-16.

This results in overcontrol, highlighting the importance of considering the exceedence frequency in detention basin design."}, {"question": "How do single-stage and multi-stage risers differ in terms of control and design requirements?", "answer": "Single-stage risers have been traditionally used but are associated with problems of undercontrol and overcontrol. In contrast, multi-stage risers, which are now preferred in more enlightened SWM policies, offer two-stage control, addressing the limitations of single-stage risers by providing more nuanced control over different event frequencies. The sizing of both types requires determining the required volume of storage and the physical characteristics of the riser, including outlet pipe diameter, riser diameter, and elevation characteristics."}, {"question": "In the context of weir flow control, what factors influence the discharge rate, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "The discharge rate in weir flow control is influenced by the depth above the weir, the discharge or weir coefficient (Cw), and the length of the weir. The relationship between these factors and the discharge (q) is defined by Equation 8-24. The value of Cw can vary depending on the characteristics of the weir and the discharge rate but is often approximated as 3.0 for simplicity."}, {"question": "Why are the sizing of risers and the determination of their physical characteristics crucial in detention basin design?", "answer": "The sizing of risers and the determination of their physical characteristics are crucial because they directly affect the effectiveness and size of the detention basin. Proper sizing ensures that the basin can manage the intended range of event frequencies without undercontrolling or overcontrolling, which is essential for achieving the desired level of flood control and water quality management. Incorrect sizing can lead to inefficiencies and potential failures in the detention system, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of these factors in the design process."}, {"question": "How does the requirement for a permanent pool in detention basins affect their design and operation?", "answer": "For policies that require a permanent pool (wet pond), the design must account for both the volume of dead storage and the corresponding elevation of the permanent pool. The total storage of the basin is the sum of the active storage, computed using the methods described in Section 8.8, and the dead storage. This requirement adds a layer of complexity to the design, as it necessitates balancing the needs for flood control, water quality management, and aesthetic or ecological considerations associated with the permanent pool."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin outlet structures, what is the significance of the exceedence frequency or return period?", "answer": "The exceedence frequency or return period is significant because it influences the design and effectiveness of the detention basin. Basins designed for more frequent events will tend to overcontrol less frequent events, while those designed for less frequent events will undercontrol more frequent ones. Understanding and appropriately addressing the exceedence frequency is critical to ensure that the detention basin functions as intended across the range of potential flood events it is designed to mitigate."}, {"question": "How do the physical characteristics of the outlet structure, such as the type of flow control (weir or orifice), impact the detention basin's performance?", "answer": "The physical characteristics of the outlet structure, including whether it is based on weir flow or orifice flow, significantly impact the detention basin's performance. Different types of flow control have different equations and coefficients (like Cw for weir flow) that affect how water is discharged from the basin. The choice and design of the outlet structure must be carefully considered to ensure it meets the specific needs and design criteria of the detention basin, including the management of various event frequencies and the prevention of overcontrol or undercontrol."}, {"question": "Why have more enlightened SWM policies begun to require two-stage control in detention basin design?", "answer": "More enlightened SWM policies have begun to require two-stage control because single-stage risers are associated with problems of undercontrol and overcontrol.

Compute the conduit invert elevation (ft) at the face of the riser: Example 8-20 The 23-acre watershed of Figure 7-10 can be used to illustrate the sizing of a single-stage riser. Given the small drainage area, a corrugated metal pipe will be used. A rectangular orifice will be cut into the riser. Computations for the post-development peak discharge were given in Example 7-19. For the pre-development conditions, a CN of 61 will be assumed, and a time of concentration of 1.25 hr was computed using a flow velocity of 0.2 Wsec over a length of 900 ft. For a CN of 61 and rainfall of 4.8 in., the runoff depth is 1.25 in. and the IJP equals 0.266. The unit peak dis- charge from Figure 7-9 is 290 csdin., so the pre-development peak discharge is = 29 )o 0 : :(- (1.25) = 13 cfs qpb Thus, the pre- to post-development peak discharge ratio is 0.619. Using this as input to Figure 8-17 yields a storage volume ratio of 0.235. Thus, the volume of active flood storage is V, = R, Q, = 0.235 (1.59) = 0.374 in. (8-92a) The stage-storage relationship at the site of the detention structure is V, = 0.0444 h2.17 in which h is the stage (ft) measured above the datum and V, is the storage (ac-ft). Based on the invert elevation of the orifice, which is E, = 2 ft, the dead storage can be com- puted from Equation 8-93 as 0.2 ac-ft. The total storage, flood plus dead, is 0.916 ac-ft (that is, Hydrologic Design Methods Chap. 8 V, = V,, + V, = 0.716 + 0.2). Using V, with Equation 8-93, the depth at flood stage can be com- puted by solving for h: The diameter of the outlet pipe is given by Equation 8-87 As a rule of thumb, the width (W,) of the orifice is taken as 75% of the conduit diameter; there- fore, W, equals 1.25 ft. The area of the orifice is Thus, the height of the rectangular orifice is 2.0811.25 = 1.666 ft. The invert of the outlet conduit (E,)i s The diameter of the riser barrel is usually 2 to 3 times the diameter of the outlet conduit, so a 4.5-ft (54-in.) corrugated metal pipe can be used for the riser.

These models help in determining the length of weir(s) and the area of the orifice, the depth and volume of storage, elevations of riser characteristics, and the diameter of the outlet pipe. By utilizing these models, engineers can accurately size the riser to manage stormwater runoff effectively."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to compute the discharge ratio in the process of sizing a single-stage riser?", "answer": "Computing the discharge ratio is necessary because it allows for the determination of the storage volume ratio, which is crucial for calculating the volume of active flood storage. This step is vital in ensuring that the detention basin can effectively mitigate the impact of increased runoff due to development. By finding the storage volume ratio from the discharge ratio, engineers can proceed to calculate the volume of storage needed, which directly influences the design of the riser and its components."}, {"question": "In the context of a single-stage riser, how does the stage-storage relationship influence the design of the detention structure?", "answer": "The stage-storage relationship is critical in determining the volume of dead storage and the total storage capacity of the detention basin. By using this relationship, engineers can find the maximum water surface elevation and subsequently design the outlet structure, whether it be an orifice or a weir, to ensure that the detention basin operates within the desired flood control parameters. This relationship is also essential for calculating the depth at flood stage, which affects the sizing of the outlet pipe and the overall efficiency of the detention structure."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the friction head-loss coefficient (Kp) in sizing the outlet pipe of a single-stage riser?", "answer": "The friction head-loss coefficient (Kp) is significant because it is used to compute the conduit diameter. The value of Kp, which depends on the pipe material and diameter, affects the calculation of the diameter of the outlet pipe. This, in turn, influences the design of the orifice or weir and the overall hydraulic performance of the riser. Accurate determination of Kp is crucial for ensuring that the outlet pipe can handle the required flow rates without excessive head loss."}, {"question": "How does the design of the orifice in a single-stage riser impact its hydraulic performance?", "answer": "The design of the orifice, including its width, area, and height, directly impacts the hydraulic performance of the single-stage riser. The orifice width is typically set as a fraction of the conduit diameter, and its area and height are calculated based on this width and the required flow characteristics. The dimensions of the orifice influence the discharge coefficient and the head loss through the orifice, which in turn affect the overall efficiency and flood control capability of the detention structure. Proper sizing of the orifice is essential to achieve the desired hydraulic performance and to ensure that the riser operates effectively under various flow conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of sizing a single-stage riser, why is it important to consider the pre- and post-development conditions of the watershed?", "answer": "Considering the pre- and post-development conditions of the watershed is important because it allows for the assessment of the impact of development on runoff characteristics. By comparing pre- and post-development peak discharges, engineers can determine the necessary storage volume ratio and design the detention structure to mitigate the increased runoff. This consideration ensures that the riser is sized appropriately to manage the altered hydrologic regime, thereby protecting downstream areas from flooding and erosion."}, {"question": "How does the sizing of a single-stage riser impact the overall flood control strategy in an urban watershed?", "answer": "The sizing of a single-stage riser significantly impacts the overall flood control strategy in an urban watershed. A properly sized riser can effectively reduce peak runoff rates and volumes, mitigating the risk of flooding and erosion in downstream areas. Moreover, the detention structure's ability to store excess runoff and release it at a controlled rate helps to protect water quality by reducing the amount of pollutants and sediments carried by stormwater runoff. Therefore, accurate sizing of the riser is crucial for achieving the goals of flood control and water quality protection in urban watersheds."}]}
{"paragraph": "8.9.2 Sizing of Two-Stage Risers Where stormwater or drainage policies require control of flow rates of two exceedence fre- quencies, the two-stage riser is an alternative for control. The structure of a two-stage riser is similar to the single-stage riser except that it includes either two weirs or a weir and an ori- fice (see Figure 8-22). For the weirlorifice structure, the orifice is used to control the more frequent event, and the larger event is controlled using the weir. The runoff from the smaller and larger events are also referred to as the low-stage and high-stage events, respectively. Values for variables at low and high stages may be followed by a subscript 1 or 2, respec- tively; for example, q,, will indicate the pre-development peak discharge for the high-stage event. Recognizing that the two events will not occur simultaneously, both the low-stage weir or orifice and the high-stage weir are used to control the high-stage event. The sizing of a two-stage riser is only slightly more complicated than the sizing of a single-stage riser. The procedure follows the same general format as for the single-stage riser, but both the high-stage weir and low-stage outlet characteristics must be determined. The input for sizing a two-stage riser is the same as that for a single-stage riser, but many of the values must be computed for both the low-stage and high-stage events. The input consists of watershed characteristics, rainfall depths, site characteristics, outlet characteristics, and the stage-storage relationship for the location. The input requirements are summarized in Worksheet 8-3. The following steps can be used to size a two-stage riser for the cases where the low-stage outlet is either a weir or an orifice: 1. a.

The SCS two-stage riser method can be used to develop a planning estimate of the storage volume and outlet facility characteristics. The input and calculations are given in Worksheet 8-5. For the watershed of Figure 8-23, the pre-development CN, assuming a C soil group, is 73 (see Table 3-18). Assume that the 2-yr, 24-hr and 10-yr, 24-hr rainfall depths are 3.0 and 5.0 in., respectively; therefore, the runoff depths (Equation 7-42) are 0.86 and 2.28 in., respectively. From Table 7-14, the 1JP ratios are 0.25 and 0.15, respectively, for the 2- and 10-yr events. The watershed has a total length of 3900 ft, with 50 ft of sheet flow in the forest, 250 ft of overland flow in the forest, 500 ft of upland gully flow, and 3100 ft of channel flow. Equation 3-47 can be used to compute the travel time for sheet flow. The flow velocities for the overland and gully flows can be obtained from Figure 3-19, with the velocity method used to compute the travel time. Channel flow velocities should be computed using Manning's Equation.

Worksheet 8-5 provides a summary of the sizing of the detention structure. Using the ra- tios of the pre-development to post-development peak discharges with the SCS detention rela- tionship (Figure 8-17), the depth of active storage for low-stage and high-stage control are 0.375 and 0.708 in., respectively, which translate to storage volumes of 4.02 and 7.59 acre-ft. At the site of the detention structure, the stage-storage relationship is V = 0.5 h1.5w here V [=I ac-ft and L [=I ft. For a permanent pond depth of 2 ft, the dead storage is 1.41 acre-ft. Thus the total volume of storage at the low-stage and high-stage flood conditions would be 5.43 and 9.00 acre-ft, respectively; from the stage-storage curve these volumes correspond to depths of 4.90 and 6.87 ft. In addition to the storage volumes, the riser must also be sized. Using Equation 8-99, the diameter of the pipe outlet is ]ar D = 0.493 = 4.42 ft (use 54 in.) I(4.9 -2 6(-66 ))'' Since the difference E2 - E, is only 2 ft, the height of the orifice opening H, will be set at 1.5 ft. The area of the orifice that would be required to limit the discharge through the orifice to the before-development peak discharge of 93.2 ft3/sec can be computed with Equation 8-100: Sec. 8.9 Sizing of Detention Basin Outlet Structures 467 Therefore, the width of the rectangular orifice is 8.33 ft, which is computed using Equation 8-101. To compute the length of the weir with Equation 8-105, the discharge (9,) through the orifice when the high-stage event occurs must be estimated with Equation 8-102: Thus, with Equation 8-105, the

such as weirs or orifices."}, {"question": "How does the sizing of a two-stage riser differ from that of a single-stage riser?", "answer": "The sizing of a two-stage riser is only slightly more complicated than the sizing of a single-stage riser, as it requires determining both the high-stage weir and low-stage outlet characteristics, and computing many values for both the low-stage and

input requirements for sizing a two-stage riser more extensive than those for a single-stage riser?", "answer": "The input requirements for sizing a two-stage riser are more extensive because they must account for both low-stage and high-stage events, including pre-development and post-development conditions, and involve calculating various parameters such as runoff depths, peak discharges, and storage volume ratios for each stage, which necessitates a more detailed analysis of watershed characteristics, rainfall patterns, and site conditions to ensure effective stormwater management."},

depths, thereby ensuring that the detention structure can effectively manage the runoff rates from the developed site and meet the local drainage policy requirements."}, {"question": "How do changes in land use, such as from forested to commercial/business use, affect the sizing of a detention structure?", "answer": "Changes in land use, such as from forested to commercial/business use, can significantly affect the sizing of a detention structure because they alter the watershed's runoff characteristics, including the curve number (CN), runoff depths, and peak discharges, which are critical inputs for sizing the detention structure, thereby necessitating an adjustment in the storage volume and outlet facility characteristics to accommodate the increased runoff rates and volumes resulting from the increased impervious cover associated with commercial or business development."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider both the low-stage and high-stage events in the design of a two-stage riser?", "answer": "Considering both the low-stage and high-stage events is important in the design of a two-stage riser because it ensures that the detention structure can effectively manage a range of storm events, from frequent, smaller storms to less frequent, larger storms, thereby protecting against flooding and erosion while also preventing excessive detention of water, which could lead to water quality issues or other environmental problems, and it allows for the optimization of the detention structure's size and outlet characteristics to meet specific drainage policy requirements and watershed conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic design, what role does the time of concentration play in determining peak discharges for stormwater management?", "answer": "The time of concentration plays a critical role in determining peak discharges for stormwater management because it influences the calculation of unit peak discharges, which are essential for estimating the peak discharges for both the low-stage and high-stage events, and it affects the sizing of the detention structure by impacting the required storage volume and outlet facility characteristics, thereby highlighting the importance of accurately determining the time of concentration based on the watershed's physical characteristics and land use conditions."}, {"question": "How does the SCS two-stage riser method account for the differences in runoff characteristics between pre-development and post-development conditions?", "answer": "The SCS two-stage riser method accounts for the differences in runoff characteristics between pre-development and post-development conditions by using different curve numbers (CN) and initial loss parameters (Ia) for the pre-development and post-development scenarios, which reflect the changes in land use and cover, and by calculating separate runoff depths, peak discharges"}]}
{"paragraph": "8.9.3 Sizing of Multiple-Stage Riser Facilities A two-stage riser uses an orifice to control the high-frequency event (that is, short return pe- riod) and a weir to control the low-frequency event (that is, long return period). A two-stage configuration usually provides adequate control because it is not necessary to use the orifice to pass large flow rates. The orifice will not pass large flow rates at low heads. Therefore, for sites with mild slopes, such as coastal areas, the orifice is not an efficient design because a large opening is required to pass a small flow rate. Large openings may not be practical be- cause of the structural integrity of the riser. For a given head the weir is a more efficient means of passing storm water through the outlet facility. A simple example will be used to show this. Several assumptions are required, and while the specific figures are sensitive to these assumptions, the general conclusion is in- sensitive to the assumptions. Equation 8-16 can be used to predict flow through an orifice. For purposes of demonstration, it will be assumed that (1) the width of the orifice equals one- third of the circumference and (2) the height of the orifice is 2 ft less than the depth of flow; these assumptions are intended to reflect limits placed on the riser design because of struc- tural considerations. These assumptions lead to the following equation for flow through an orifice: where d is the diameter (ft) of the riser and h is the depth (ft) of flow. If we assume that the length of a weir equals the circumference of the riser, then discharge over a weir is given by The values of Table 8-5 show qw and % for selected values of d and h with C, = 3.1. .These results are intended only to show that for low heads, a weir will be more effective in passing high discharge rates. Recognizing that sites with mild slopes will not be capable of high heads, weir flow is desirable for controlling both the low- and high-stage events. Thus an alternative to the two- stage riser with an orifice and a weir is an outlet facility with two risers, with each riser serv- ing as a weir. One riser can be used to control the low-stage event, while the other riser con- trols the high-stage event. A single-outlet conduit can be used to discharge flow from both risers.

Using the same data, a low-stage weir can be designed using Step 11 of Worksheet 8-5. The low-stage weir length is The low-stage weir is 6.07 ft in length. During the high-stage event the flow over the low-stage weir is q,, = 3.1 (6.07) (6.87 - 4.90)l.' = 52 ft3/sec (8-1 19) The length of the high-stage weir is PROBLEMS 8-1.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to making technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1. What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. An engineer involved in land development frequently designs detention basins to control the additional storm water that runs off of the urbanized land. The local drainage policy requires use of the Rational Formula Hydrograph Method (Equation 8-67) in sizing the storage volume. The Rational Method is used to estimate the peak discharges. In comput- ing the peak discharges with the Rational Method, the engineer uses the upper limit on the runoff coefficient C for the pre-development condition (for example, 0.3 for the unimproved category in Table 7-12) and the lower limit on the C value for the post-development condi- tion (for example, 0.4 for detached, multiunit residential category in Table 7-10). This prac- tice results in the smallest possible storage volume, which reduces both the cost of the deten- tion facility and the amount of land that must be devoted to flood control. The company's project costs are lower and the profits maximized. Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis I CHAPTER OBJECTIVES 1.

Sec. 9.0 Notation", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of sizing multiple-stage riser facilities, what is the primary function of an orifice and a weir?", "answer": "An orifice is used to control high-frequency events (short return periods), while a weir is used to control low-frequency events (long return periods). The orifice is not efficient for sites with mild slopes due to the required large opening, which may compromise the structural integrity of the riser. In contrast, a weir is a more efficient means of passing stormwater through the outlet facility, especially for low heads."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions made in the example for flow through an orifice affect the outcome, and what are the implications for design?", "answer": "The assumptions made, such as the width of the orifice being one-third of the circumference and the height being 2 ft less than the depth of flow, lead to a specific equation for flow through an orifice. These assumptions reflect limits placed on the riser design due to structural considerations and result in a particular stage-discharge relationship. The implications for design are that the orifice may not be the most efficient choice for all scenarios, especially those with low heads, and alternative designs, such as using a weir, should be considered to optimize the outlet facility's performance."}, {"question": "Why is a weir more effective than an orifice for controlling both low- and high-stage events in detention basin design?", "answer": "A weir is more effective because it can pass higher discharge rates at low heads, making it suitable for sites with mild slopes where high heads are not achievable. This is particularly important for controlling both low- and high-stage events, as weirs can efficiently manage a wide range of flow rates, reducing the need for complex multi-stage systems."}, {"question": "In the design of a detention basin outlet, what factors influence the choice between a single-stage riser with an orifice and a weir, and a two-stage riser with separate orifices and weirs?", "answer": "The choice between these designs depends on the specific hydrological conditions of the site, including the slope, the required control of high- and low-frequency events, and the structural integrity of the riser. A single-stage riser with a weir might be preferred for simplicity and efficiency in managing a broad range of flow rates, while a two-stage system might be necessary for more complex scenarios requiring precise control over different return periods."}, {"question": "How does the design of a roof drainage system, including the sizing of vertical and horizontal drains, impact the management of stormwater runoff?", "answer": "The design of a roof drainage system directly affects the management of stormwater runoff by controlling the flow rate and direction of runoff. Proper sizing of vertical and horizontal drains ensures that the system can handle the expected rainfall intensities and durations, preventing overflow and reducing the risk of flooding. This design must consider local drainage policies, the slope of the drains, and the characteristics of the roof area to effectively manage stormwater."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the Rational Formula Hydrograph Method for sizing detention basins, and how might this method influence design decisions?", "answer": "The Rational Formula Hydrograph Method provides a standardized approach to estimating peak discharges and sizing detention basins. However, the choice of runoff coefficients (C values) can significantly impact the calculated storage volume. Using the upper limit for pre-development and the lower limit for post-development conditions minimizes the required storage volume, reducing costs but potentially underestimating actual runoff needs. This approach can lead to designs that may not fully mitigate the increased runoff from urbanization, highlighting the need for careful consideration of design parameters and their implications for stormwater management."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis and synthesis, what role do empirical methods for representing infiltration capacity play, and how do these methods contribute to understanding runoff processes?", "answer": "Empirical methods for representing infiltration capacity, such as the SCS curve number method, play a crucial role in hydrograph analysis and synthesis by providing a simplified way to estimate runoff depths and peak rates. These methods contribute to understanding runoff processes by accounting for the complex interactions between rainfall, soil characteristics, and land use, allowing for more accurate predictions of runoff behavior and better design of stormwater management systems."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the stage-storage-discharge relationship in the design of detention basins, and how does this relationship impact the overall performance of the basin?", "answer": "Considering the stage-storage-discharge relationship is essential because it directly affects the detention basin's ability to manage stormwater runoff effectively. This relationship determines how the basin stores and releases water, influencing the peak discharge rates and the timing of runoff.

This can be storage in manmade structures, storage at a natural constriction in the flow path, or channel storage. Where storage is significant, design work is usually based on hydrographs rather than peak discharge rates. Hydrographs are also used for designs on nonhomogeneous water- sheds, such as where significant variation in land use, soil types, or topography exists within the watershed. Thls is especially necessary where parts of watersheds undergo land use change such as urbanization or deforestation. I", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of engineering design problems, why are peak discharge rates inadequate for certain watershed or channel storage situations?", "answer": "Peak discharge rates are inadequate for design problems where watershed or channel storage is significant because they do not account for the storage in manmade structures, natural constrictions, or channel storage, which can significantly impact the design."}, {"question": "How do hydrographs differ from peak discharge rates in terms of their application in design work?", "answer": "Hydrographs are used for designs where storage is significant or in nonhomogeneous watersheds, whereas peak discharge rates are used for simpler design problems. Hydrographs provide a more detailed representation of the flow over time, allowing for better consideration of storage and variability in the watershed."}, {"question": "In the context of nonhomogeneous watersheds, what factors can lead to the need for hydrograph-based designs?", "answer": "Factors such as significant variation in land use, soil types, or topography within the watershed can lead to the need for hydrograph-based designs. This is because these variations can affect the flow and storage characteristics of the watershed, making peak discharge rates insufficient for accurate design. Additionally, land use changes like urbanization or deforestation can further complicate the hydrology of the watershed, necessitating the use of hydrographs."}, {"question": "Why are hydrographs particularly necessary for watersheds undergoing land use changes such as urbanization or deforestation?", "answer": "Hydrographs are necessary for watersheds undergoing land use changes because these changes can significantly alter the hydrological characteristics of the watershed. Urbanization, for example, can increase runoff and reduce infiltration, while deforestation can increase runoff and alter soil properties. By using hydrographs, designers can better account for these changes and their impacts on the watershed's storage and flow characteristics."}, {"question": "In what situations is the use of peak discharge rates sufficient for design purposes?", "answer": "The use of peak discharge rates is sufficient for design purposes when watershed or channel storage is not significant. This implies situations where the flow path does not have substantial storage in manmade structures, natural constrictions, or channel storage, and the watershed is relatively homogeneous in terms of land use, soil types, and topography."}, {"question": "How does the consideration of storage in design work impact the choice between using peak discharge rates and hydrographs?", "answer": "The consideration of storage in design work is crucial because it directly impacts the choice between using peak discharge rates and hydrographs. When storage is significant, hydrographs are preferred because they can account for the temporal distribution of flow and the effects of storage on the watershed's hydrological response. In contrast, peak discharge rates are more suitable for situations where storage effects are minimal, and the primary concern is the maximum flow rate."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not considering storage in watershed or channel design?", "answer": "Not considering storage in watershed or channel design can lead to inadequate designs that do not account for the complexities of the hydrological system. This can result in designs that are either over- or under-sized, potentially leading to failures or inefficiencies. For example, neglecting the impact of a natural constriction on flow storage could lead to an underestimation of the required capacity of a downstream structure, potentially causing it to overflow during significant events."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological design, what role do natural constrictions in the flow path play?", "answer": "Natural constrictions in the flow path can play a significant role in hydrological design by affecting the storage and flow characteristics of the watershed. These constrictions can create areas of significant storage, which must be considered in design work to ensure that the hydrological system is accurately represented. The impact of these constrictions can be particularly important in nonhomogeneous watersheds or those undergoing land use changes, where the hydrological response may be more complex and variable."}, {"question": "How do manmade structures influence the need for hydrograph-based designs in watersheds?", "answer": "Manmade structures, such as dams or reservoirs, can significantly influence the need for hydrograph-based designs in watersheds. These structures can alter the natural flow regime and create additional storage, which must be accounted for in design work. By using hydrographs, designers can better understand the impact of these structures on the watershed's hydrological response and ensure that their designs are appropriate for the altered conditions."}, {"question": "What challenges are associated with designing for watersheds with significant variation in land use, soil types, or topography?", "answer": "Designing for watersheds with significant variation in land use, soil types, or topography is challenging because these variations can lead to complex and variable hydrological responses.

The rainfall hyetograph is separated into three time-dependent functions: the initial abstraction, the loss function, and the rainfall ex- cess; these are shown in Figure 9-1. The initial abstraction is that part of the rainfall that oc- curs prior to the start of direct runoff. The rainfall excess is that part of the rainfall that ap- pears as direct runoff. The lossfinction is that part of the rainfall that occurs after the start of direct runoff but does not appear as direct runoff. The process is sometimes conceptualized as a two-part separation of the rainfall, with the initial abstraction being included as part of the loss function. The three components are used here for clarity and to emphasize the differ- ences between the important processes of the hydrologic cycle. The runoff hydrograph is conceptually separated into two parts: direct runoff and base- flow (Figure 9-1). The direct runoff is the storm runoff that results from rainfall excess; the volumes of rainfall excess and direct runoff must be equal. The transferfunction, or unit hy- drograph, is the function that transforms the rainfall excess into the direct runoff. For the purpose of our conceptual framework, baseflow is the runoff that has resulted from an accu- mulation of water in the watershed from past stom events and would appear as streamflow even if the rain for the current storm event had not occurred.

This is usu- ally the first step because baseflow is usually a smooth function and it can be estimated more accurately than some of the other separation steps. Having estimated the baseflow and direct runoff hydrographs, the volume of direct runoff can be computed. Having analyzed the runoff hydrograph, attention can be directed to the rainfall hyeto- graph. The initial abstraction is delineated if it is to be handled separately from the other losses.

{"paragraph": "9.2.2 Constant-Slope Baseflow Separation If the runoff process is conceptualized in a way that flow from ground water aquifers begins on the hydrograph recession prior to the point used for the constant-discharge method, then it is only necessary to select the point on the recession curve where direct runoff ends. Several methods have been proposed for identifying this point. The most common conceptualization Sec. 9.2 Baseflow Separation 483 uses the inflection point on the hydrograph recession; the inflection point is the point where the hydrograph goes from being concave to convex (that is, the slope being greater than 1 to the slope being less than 1). A second method uses an empirical formula, such as the follow- ing equation that has been proposed for very large watersheds: in which N is the number of days from the time to peak of the measured runoff hydrograph to the end of direct runoff and A is the drainage area in square miles. A third method is called the master depletion curve method, which is discussed below. While these three options are quite objective, the point is often selected subjectively using a graph of the runoff hydro- graph. Once the time at which direct runoff ends has been identified, direct runoff and base- flow are separated by connecting a straight line extending from the point of the lowest dis- charge rate at the start of the flood runoff to the point on the recession. The constant-slope method is also shown in Figure 9-2.

By subtracting the baseflow, which represents the groundwater contribution, from the total discharge, hydrologists can quantify the amount of runoff that is directly related to surface and near-surface processes.

The constant-slope method provides a more nuanced approach but still simplifies the baseflow dynamics.

Based on this, it can be used to identify a point on the recession where direct runoff ends and baseflow begins; however, it also provides a model of the recession limb. The pro- cedure requires measured storm hydrographs for a good number of storm events covering a wide range of volumes and for different seasons of the year. The procedure is as follows: 1. Using semi-log paper, log q versus time, plot the recession curves for each storm event on separate pieces of tracing paper. 2. On a master sheet having a log q versus time-axis system (semi-log paper), plot the re- cession for the storm event having the smallest values of log q. 3. Using the recession curve with the next smallest values of log q values, position the tracing paper such that the curve appears to extend along a line coincident with the re- cession of the first event plotted. 4. Continue this process using successively larger magnitude log q recessions until all storm events are plotted. 5. Construct a master depletion curve that extends through the recessions of the observed storm events. Then fit a mathematical model to the master depletion curve; the follow- ing functional form often provides a reasonable fit to the data: in which q, is the discharge at time t, qo is the discharge at time t = 0, and K is a fitting coefficient. The value of K can be determined using any two points of the master de- pletion curve. Letting one point be q,, then making a natural-logarithm transformation of Equation 9-5 and solving for K yields Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 where t is the time at which discharge q, is recorded. If sufficient scatter is evident in the recession line, then least squares can be used to estimate K. If the value of q, is set, then the least squares estimator of K is in which n is the number of pairs of (q,, ti) points on the recession. Example 9-2 The fitting and use of the master-depletion-curve method can be demonstrated using the data of Table 9-2, which gives pats of storm hydrographs for six storm events that were measured at 6-hr time intervals. Using five of the six storm events, the procedure above was used to obtain the master depletion curve for the watershed. Five storm events were plotted on tracing paper (Figure 9-3) to develop the master depletion curve, which is shown in Figure 9 4 .

{"paragraph": "9.3 ESTIMATION OF INITIAL ABSTRACTION One definition of initial abstraction was previously stated. Specifically, one can assume that the initial abstraction consists of all rainfall that occurs prior to the start of direct storm runoff. As an alternative, the initial abstraction may be assumed to be a constant volume (depth). Viessman (1968) found that for small urban watersheds a value of 0.1 in. was rea- sonable. For rural and forested watersheds, a larger volume would be expected. The SCS method (which is discussed in Section 7.8) assumes that the initial abstraction is a fixed frac- tion of the maximum retention but varies with soil and land use since the retention is a func- tion of the soil group and land use. A number of methods have been proposed for estimating the initial abstraction. Two methods of identifying the initial abstraction are illustrated in Figure 9-6. Figure 9-6a shows a rainfall hyetograph with 0.4 in. of an initial abstraction. In this case, the depth of initial ab- straction is constant regardless of the rainfall distribution. As an alternative, Figure 9-6b shows the initial abstraction when the direct runoff begins at a storm time of 30 min; in this case, the initial abstraction would have a depth of 0.9 in. The specific-volume method of Fig- ure 9-6a requires specification of the depth of the initial abstraction; since only a few studies of this element of the runoff process have been made, it is difficult to justify a specific value. The specific-time method of Figure 9-6b can result in depths of initial abstraction that may be unusually high. Thus both the specific-volume and specific-time methods have draw- backs. For this reason, initial abstraction is sometimes considered to be part of the losses and not a separate calculation.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of estimating initial abstraction, what is one common assumption about its composition?", "answer": "One common assumption is that the initial abstraction consists of all rainfall that occurs prior to the start of direct storm runoff."}, {"question": "How does the SCS method approach the estimation of initial abstraction, and what factors does it consider?", "answer": "The SCS method assumes that the initial abstraction is a fixed fraction of the maximum retention, which varies with soil and land use since the retention is a function of the soil group and land use. This approach implies that the initial abstraction is not constant but depends on the specific characteristics of the watershed, such as soil type and land cover. The consideration of these factors makes the SCS method more nuanced and potentially more accurate for different types of watersheds."}, {"question": "In urban watersheds, what value of initial abstraction has been found to be reasonable, according to Viessman (1968)?", "answer": "A value of 0.1 in. was found to be reasonable for small urban watersheds."}, {"question": "Why are the specific-volume and specific-time methods for estimating initial abstraction considered to have drawbacks?", "answer": "The specific-volume method requires specification of the depth of the initial abstraction, which is challenging due to the limited studies on this element of the runoff process, making it difficult to justify a specific value. On the other hand, the specific-time method can result in depths of initial abstraction that may be unusually high. These drawbacks highlight the complexity and variability of initial abstraction, making its estimation a challenging task."}, {"question": "How does the initial abstraction relate to the concept of losses in the runoff process, and why is it sometimes considered part of these losses?", "answer": "The initial abstraction is sometimes considered to be part of the losses and not a separate calculation because it represents the amount of rainfall that is lost before direct storm runoff begins. This consideration is due to the challenges in accurately estimating initial abstraction using methods like the specific-volume and specific-time approaches, which have their drawbacks. By incorporating initial abstraction into the broader category of losses, the complexity of separately calculating it can be avoided, simplifying the runoff estimation process."}, {"question": "In the context of rural and forested watersheds, what can be expected regarding the volume of initial abstraction compared to urban watersheds?", "answer": "A larger volume of initial abstraction would be expected for rural and forested watersheds compared to urban watersheds. This expectation is based on the differences in land cover and soil characteristics between these types of watersheds, which influence the amount of rainfall that is abstracted before runoff begins."}, {"question": "What is the implication of considering initial abstraction as a fixed fraction of the maximum retention, as in the SCS method, for the estimation of runoff in different watersheds?", "answer": "Considering initial abstraction as a fixed fraction of the maximum retention implies that the estimation of runoff will take into account the specific hydrological characteristics of the watershed, such as soil type and land use. This approach allows for more tailored runoff estimates, potentially improving the accuracy of hydrological predictions for various types of watersheds. However, it also requires detailed information about the watershed's characteristics, which can be a challenge in data-scarce regions."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to justify a specific value for the depth of initial abstraction in the specific-volume method?", "answer": "It is challenging to justify a specific value for the depth of initial abstraction in the specific-volume method because only a few studies have been made on this element of the runoff process. The lack of comprehensive research on initial abstraction makes it difficult to determine a universally applicable or even a widely acceptable value for its depth, leading to uncertainty in runoff estimates when using this method."}, {"question": "How does the specific-time method for estimating initial abstraction determine its depth, and what potential issue can arise from this approach?", "answer": "The specific-time method determines the depth of initial abstraction based on when direct runoff begins, which can be at a specific storm time. A potential issue with this approach is that it can result in depths of initial abstraction that may be unusually high, which might not accurately represent the actual initial abstraction process. This issue underscores the need for careful consideration and possibly the combination of different methods to achieve more reliable estimates of initial abstraction."}, {"question": "In what way does the estimation of initial abstraction impact the overall understanding and prediction of the runoff process?", "answer": "The estimation of initial abstraction is crucial for the overall understanding and prediction of the runoff process because it directly affects the amount of rainfall that is considered to contribute to direct storm runoff. Accurate estimation of initial abstraction is essential for predicting the timing, volume, and peak of runoff, which are critical for various hydrological applications, including flood control, water resource management, and environmental planning. The challenges in estimating initial abstraction, as discussed, highlight the complexity of the runoff process and the need for continued research and refinement of estimation methods."}]}
{"paragraph": "9.4 SEPARATION OF LOSSES USING INDEX METHODS Losses reflect the ability of the watershed to retain water. At the beginning of a storm event that has been preceded by a period with no rainfall, the vegetation is dry, depressions are empty, and the upper layers of the soil structure have relatively low soil moisture. These wa- Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 tershed conditions represent the greatest potential for immediate storage of rainwater. Losses are usually thought to consist of water intercepted by vegetation (interception storage), water stored in small surface depressions (depression storage), and water that infiltrates into the soil (soil storage). It is easy to become aware of interception storage. The interception of rain is evident from the dry area under the crown of a tree for the first few moments of a storm. The amount of interception storage could be measured using two rain gages, with one located under the crown of the tree and another placed outside the range of influence of the tree. This has been done at hydrologic research stations, and empirical formulas are available for estimating the interception storage as a function of the type and characteristics of the vege- tation. Depression storage, which is storage on the surface of the watershed in small depres- sions, depends on topography and land cover. Both depression and interception storage are depleted during the early part of a storm and thus are part of the initial abstraction if it is han- dled separately from other losses. The primary component of losses is infiltration of rainwater into subsurface storage. In general, the available volume of subsurface storage is greatest at the start of rainfall and de- creases over the duration of the storm. After a certain time, the infiltration capacity ap- proaches a constant rate. Between storm events percolation and evapotranspiration serve to decrease water stored in the soil structure; this process is referred to as ground water storage recovery.

This is because these conditions allow for maximum interception, depression, and infiltration storage capacities. The dry conditions enable the watershed to absorb more water initially, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of storm runoff and the overall hydrologic response of the watershed."}, {"question": "Why are losses in a watershed usually thought to consist of water intercepted by vegetation, water stored in small surface depressions, and water that infiltrates into the soil?", "answer": "Losses in a watershed are usually considered to comprise these components because they represent the primary ways in which the watershed retains water. Interception storage by vegetation, depression storage in small surface depressions, and soil storage through infiltration are fundamental processes that occur as rainwater interacts with the watershed. Understanding these components is essential for analyzing the hydrologic balance and predicting runoff, as they directly influence the amount of water that becomes runoff versus the amount that is retained within the watershed."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis, how does the amount of interception storage relate to the type and characteristics of vegetation?", "answer": "The amount of interception storage is related to the type and characteristics of vegetation because different types of vegetation have varying capacities to intercept rainwater. Empirical formulas are available for estimating interception storage as a function of vegetation type and characteristics, indicating that the physical properties of vegetation (such as leaf density and canopy structure) play a significant role in determining how much rainwater is intercepted. This relationship highlights the importance of considering vegetation in hydrologic models, especially in areas with diverse or dense vegetation cover."}, {"question": "What is the primary component of losses in a watershed during a storm event, and how does it change over the duration of the storm?", "answer": "The primary component of losses is the infiltration of rainwater into subsurface storage. At the start of rainfall, the available volume of subsurface storage is greatest, but it decreases over the duration of the storm as the soil becomes saturated. After a certain time, the infiltration capacity approaches a constant rate, indicating that the soil's ability to absorb water becomes limited as it reaches its storage capacity. This dynamic is crucial for understanding the temporal distribution of runoff and the overall storm hydrograph."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater storage, what processes serve to decrease water stored in the soil structure between storm events?", "answer": "Between storm events, percolation and evapotranspiration are the processes that serve to decrease water stored in the soil structure, a process referred to as groundwater storage recovery. Percolation involves the downward movement of water through the soil layers, eventually recharging groundwater, while evapotranspiration involves the loss of water from the soil and plants to the atmosphere. These processes are essential for the long-term water balance of a watershed, as they influence the amount of water available for subsequent storm events and the overall health of the ecosystem."}, {"question": "How do depression and interception storage contribute to the initial abstraction during a storm event?", "answer": "Depression and interception storage are depleted during the early part of a storm and thus are part of the initial abstraction if it is handled separately from other losses.

These methods aim to improve the accuracy of hydrologic models by better representing the processes that influence water retention and runoff in watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of soil moisture, how does the condition of the soil at the start of a storm event impact its ability to store water?", "answer": "The condition of the soil at the start of a storm event, particularly its moisture content, significantly impacts its ability to store water. A soil with relatively low moisture content, as is typical after a period with no rainfall, has a greater capacity to store water through infiltration. This initial condition affects the infiltration rate and the overall amount of water that can be stored in the soil, influencing the subsequent hydrologic response of the watershed to the storm event."}]}
{"paragraph": "9.4.1 Phi-Index Method To thls point in the analysis process, the baseflow has been estimated and subtracted from the total runoff to determine the distribution of direct runoff; the volume of direct runoff is then computed. Also, the initial abstraction has been identified and separated from the mea- sured rainfall hyetograph. From a conceptual standpoint, the remaining part of the rainfall hyetograph must be separated into losses and rainfall excess, such that the volume of rainfall excess equals the volume of direct runoff. By definition the phi index (4) equals the average rainfall intensity (or depth) above which the volume of rainfall excess equals the volume of direct runoff. Thus the value of is adjusted such that the volumes of rainfall excess and direct runoff are equal. The proce- dure for computing the phi index is listed here: 1. Compute the depths of rainfall (V,) and direct runoff (V,). 2. Make an initial estimate of the phi index: in which D is the duration of rainfall (excluding that part separated as initial abstrac- + tion) and is an intensity, with dimension of length per unit time such as inches per hour.

{"paragraph": "9.5 SEPARATION OF LOSSES USING INFILTRATION CAPACITY CURVES A dry soil has a certain capacity for infiltrating water. The capacity can be expressed as a depth of water that can be infiltrated per unit time, such as inches per hour. If rainfall sup plies water at a rate that is greater than the infiltration capacity, water will infiltrate at the ca- pacity rate, with the excess either ponding, draining as surface runoff, or evaporating. If rain- fall supplies water at a rate that is less than the infiltration capacity, all of the water supply will infiltrate. In either case, as water infiltrates into the soil, the capacity to infiltrate more water decreases and approaches a minimum capacity. When the supply rate is equal to or greater than the capacity to infiltrate, the minimum capacity will be approached more quickly than when the supply rate is much less than the infiltration capacity. This conceptual descrip tion of infiltration can be used to develop a model for separating rainfall excess from losses.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of infiltration capacity, how does the rate of rainfall influence the infiltration process?", "answer": "The rate of rainfall influences the infiltration process by determining whether water will infiltrate at the capacity rate or if excess water will pond, drain as surface runoff, or evaporate.

This rapid approach to minimum capacity is due to the continuous supply of water at or above the rate the soil can absorb, leaving less room for additional infiltration as the soil becomes saturated. As a result, the soil's infiltration capacity decreases more rapidly under these conditions."}, {"question": "How does the conceptual description of infiltration contribute to understanding rainfall excess and losses?", "answer": "The conceptual description of infiltration provides a basis for developing a model to separate rainfall excess from losses.

When infiltration occurs, it contributes to groundwater storage, which can later supply water to streams, rivers, and aquifers, supporting both human uses and ecosystem health. Conversely, when infiltration is limited, more rainfall becomes surface runoff, which can lead to increased flood risks and reduced groundwater recharge.

{"paragraph": "9.5.4 Mass Infiltration Method In the example of Figure 9-8, the rainfall intensity was always greater than the infiltration capacity; when such a condition exists, the available water is sufficient such that the rate of infiltration equals the capacity of the soil structure to store and transmit the water. In cases where the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity, all of the available soil stor- age is not used. Thus the capacity does not decrease at the same rate as it would if the rainfall intensity (that is, the available supply rate) were equal to or greater than the capacity. If one assumes that the capacity decreases at the rate given by Equation 9-14 when it would actu- ally be less than the capacity, the volume of losses will be underestimated and the volume of rainfall excess will be overestimated. The mass infiltration method can be used to estimate the infiltration capacity when the rainfall intensity is less than the capacity.

However, for the rainfall hyetograph of Figure 9-10 the infiltration capacity curve will not be the same as for Figure 9-8 because the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity for t < 2 hours. Thus the mass infiltration curve must be computed. Equation 9-20b becomes Using Equations 9-15 and 9-21 to compute f and F, respectively, the mass infiltration curve can be computed (see Table 9-4 and Figure 9-11). The infiltration capacity curve for the rainfall hyetograph of Figure 9-10 can be estimated using the mass infiltration curve. After 1 hr the total depth of rainfall is 0.1 in.; entering Figure 9-11 with F = 0.1 in., the value off is 0.55 in./hr, which is shown in Figure 9-10. The infiltration capacity of 0.55 in./hr can be compared with the Sec. 9.5 Separation of Losses Using Infiltration Capacity Curves Time (hr) FIGURE 9-1 0 Estimating the infiltra- tion capacity using the mass infiltration method. case where the rainfall intensity exceeded the infiltration capacity. Figure 9-8 shows that the in- filtration capacity was 0.42 when the rainfall rate exceeded the infiltration capacity during the first hour. Thus the low-intensity rainfall of Figure 9-10 during the first hour caused the infiltra- tion capacity to decrease by an amount that was less than that when the rainfall intensity had been greater than the infiltration capacity, such as in Figure 9-8. After the second hour of the storm in Figure 9-10, a total rainfall depth of 0.4 in. had occurred. Entering Figure 9-11 with F = 0.4 in. yields an infiltration capacity f of 0.45 in./hr, rather than the 0.32 in./hr indicated in Figure 9-8 when the rainfall intensity exceeded the capacity.

In practice, they are not known, so val- ues must be estimated through data analysis. It is usually assumed that the initial abstraction is part of the loss function when using the infiltration capacity approach, but even with this simplifying assumption the analysis approach is not easily solved without a computer. An approximate infiltration capacity curve can be drawn if values are available for two of the three coefficients of Equation 9-14. The ultimate capacityf, and the decay coefficient K are probably easier to relate to soil and cover characteristics, so values for these variables may be available. If the depth of losses is known, F can be used to represent the depth of losses and Equation 9-20b can be solved for f,: In Equation 9-23, t is the duration of the storm event and f, is the initial infiltration capacity. Example 9-10 Figure 9-12a shows a 4-hr rainfall hyetograph. If we assume that analysis of the runoff hydro- graph resulted in a depth of direct runoff of 1.1 in., there would be 1.1 in. of rainfall excess. Since the total depth of rainfall is 1.8 in., the infiltration capacity curve must separate 0.7 in. of losses. If soil studies suggest that K = 1.2 hr-' and f, = 0.1 in./hr, Equation 9-23 yields a value for f, of Based on this value of the initial capacity, the infiltration capacity curve of Figure 9-12a was drawn.

This assumption can lead to inaccuracies in estimating the infiltration capacity curve, particularly if the initial abstraction is significant. However, it is a common practice due to the complexity of separating the initial abstraction from other loss components without detailed data. The implications of this assumption highlight the need for careful consideration of the underlying hydrological processes and the limitations of the infiltration capacity approach."}, {"question": "In the context of infiltration capacity analysis, how does the depth of direct runoff influence the estimation of losses?", "answer": "The depth of direct runoff is crucial because it, along with the total depth of rainfall, determines the depth of losses.

{"paragraph": "9.5.6 The Green-Ampt Model The Green-Ampt Model is a conceptual representation of the infiltration process. Developed in 1911 by Green and Arnpt, the model can be developed from Darcy's Law (Equation 6-1): in which V = the velocity of flow through the unsaturated soil, h is the head, and L is the length of the soil column. The hydraulic grahent in Darcy's Law equals the ratio of the sum of the depth of ponding dp, the depth of the wetting front from the ground surface L,, and the soil water suction S, at the wetting front to the depth L,: The total depth of infiltration F to time t equals the product of the depth to the wetting front and the difference in the saturated 0, and initial Oiv olumetric water contents: Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 The method assumes that t, and ti are constant with time as the wetting front advances. Therefore, the change in F with time becomes The rate dFldt of Equation 9-27 equals Darcy's velocity of Equation 9-24. Using the as- sumption that the depth of ponding is very small, Equation 9-25 can be substituted into Equation 9-24, with the result equated to Equation 9-27: Rearranging Equation 9-28 yields Integrating Equation 9-29 yields in which Cis the constant of integration. At time t = 0, F = 0; since (0, - 0,) in Equation 9-26 is a non-zero constant, then Lw = 0 when F = 0. Thus at t = 0, the constant of integration is C = Sw In Sw - Sw (9-3 1) which when substituted into Equation 9-30 yields Kst = L,, - Sw ln (0s 0,) - Using Equation 9-26 yields a relationship between F and t: The infiltration capacity f at any time t can be computed by taking the derivative of Equa- tion 9-34: In applying Equations 9-34 and 9-35, the underlying assumptions should be recog- nized: Sec. 9.5 Separation of Losses Using Infiltration Capacity Curves 503 1. As rain continues to fall and water infiltrates, the wetting front advances at the same rate throughout the ground water system, which produces a well-defined wetting front. 2. The volumetric water contents, 0, and Oi, remain constant above and below the wetting front as it advances. 3. The soil-water suction immediately below the wetting front remains constant with both time and location as the wetting front advances. If the rainfall has constant intensity i and exceeds the infiltration capacityf, the infiltra- tion rate will equal the intensity i until ponding occurs. At that time, a cumulative depth F, will have infiltrated, which can be estimated from Equation 9-35: A modification of Equation 9-34 was proposed by Mein and Larson (1973) to compute the relationship between F and t: in which te is the equivalent time to infiltrate a depth F, when subject to initially ponded sur- face conditions. Example 9-12 In the synthesis mode, input values are required for K,, Sw,4 , and O,, as well as the rainfall in- tensity i. The following values are assumed as input: K, = 0.02 in./hr; Sw = 10 in.; Oi = 0.15; 0, = 0.45; i = 0.4 in./hour. The soil-water deficit at the beginning of rainfall is given by (8, - Oi) and equals 0.30 for the given values in this example.

{"paragraph": "9.6.1 Definitions In Section 9.1 a conceptual framework was presented where a unit hydrograph (UH) was used as the system transfer function, that is, the function used to transform rainfall excess into direct runoff. By way of definition, a unit hydrograph is the hydrograph that results from 1 in. of rainfall excess generated uniformly over the watershed at a uniform rate during a specified period of time. There are four aspects of this definition that should be given spe- cial notice: (1) 1 in. of rainfall excess, (2) uniform spatial distribution of rainfall over the wa- Sec. 9.6 Unit Hydrograph Concepts Time (hr) FIGURE 9-13 Infiltration rate (n computed using the Green-Ampt Method. tershed, (3) a rainfall excess rate that is constant with time, and (4) specific duration of rain- fall excess. When developing a unit hydrograph, it is important to ensure that the sum of the ordinates is equivalent to 1 area-in. of direct runoff. A lack of spatial uniformity of rainfall can result in a unit hydrograph that does not reflect the temporal characteristics of runoff. The third part of the definition can be constraining because it is difficult to find storm events of significant volume where the excess rate is constant; it is usually necessary to accept some departure from the assumption of a constant rate. The peak and time to peak of a UH are sen- sitive to the duration of the rainfall excess, so it must be specified when developing a UH and considered when using a UH for design. Several types of unit hydrographs can be defined. A T-hour (or T-minute) unit hydro- graph is the hydrograph that results from a storm with a constant depth of rainfall excess of 1 in. over a duration of T hours (or T minutes). An instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) is a special case of the T-hour UH with the duration of rainfall excess being infinitesimally small; for such a UH to have a depth of 1 in., the intensity of the instantaneous rainfall excess is ob- viously not finite. The use of the concept of an IUH will be hscussed later. The dimension- less unit hydrograph, which is a third form, is a direct runoff hydrograph whose ordinates are given as ratios of the peak discharge and whose time axis is defined as the ratio of the time to the time to peak; that is, a dimensionless UH has an axis system of qlq, versus tlt,, where qp is the discharge rate at the time to peak t,.

Except for having the depths (or volumes) of rainfall excess and direct runoff equal, the separation of baseflow from direct runoff was independent of the separation of losses from rainfall ex- Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 cess. The purpose of the hydrograph separation analysis of Figure 9-1 is to identify the trans- fer function so that the analyzed transfer function can be used with a synthetic design storm to compute the design runoff hydrograph. The process by which the design storm is com- bined with the transfer function to produce the direct runoff hydrograph is called convolution. Analytically speaking, convolution is referred to as the theory of linear superposition- ing. Conceptually, it is a process of multiplication, translation with time, and addition. That is, the first burst of rainfall excess of duration D is multiplied by the ordinates of the unit hy- drograph (UH). The UH is then translated for a time length of D, and the next burst of rain- fall excess is multiplied by the UH. After the UH has been translated for all bursts of rainfall excess of duration D, the results of the multiplications are summed for each time interval. Thls process of multiplication, translation, and addition is the means of deriving a design runoff hydrograph from the rainfall excess and the UH. The convolution process is best introduced using some very simple examples that illus- trate the multiplication-translation-addition operation. First, consider a burst of rainfall ex- cess of 1 in. that occurs over a period D. Assuming that the UH consists of two ordinates, 0.4 and 0.6, the direct runoff is computed by multiplying the rainfall excess burst by the UH; this is best presented graphically as in Figure 9-14a. It is important to note that the depth of di- rect runoff equals the depth of rainfall excess, which in this case is 1 in. If 2 in. of rainfall excess occurs over a period of D, the depth of direct runoff must he 2 in. Using the same UH as the previous example, the resulting runoff hydrograph is shown in Figure 9-14b. In both this example and the previous example, computation of the runoff hydrograph consisted solely of multiplication; the translation and addition parts of the con- volution process were not necessary because the rainfall excess occurred over a single time interval of D. To illustrate the multiplication-translation-additiono peration, consider 2 in. of rainfall excess that occurs uniformly over a period 20. This gives an intensity of 1 in. per time inter- val. In this case, the direct runoff will have a depth of 2 in., but the time distribution of direct runoff will differ from that of the previous example because the time distribution of rainfall excess is different. Figure 9-14c shows the multiplication-translation-addition operation. In this case, the time base of the runoff hydrograph is 3 time units (30). In general, the time base of the runoff (tbRo)i s given by in which tbPEa nd t,, are the time bases of the rainfall excess and unit hydrograph, respec- tively. For the example above, both t,, and t,, equal 2, and therefore, according to Equa- tion 9-43 tbROeq uals 3 0 time units. One more simple example should illustrate the convolution process. In Figure 9-14d the depth of rainfall excess equals 3 in., with 2 in. occurring in the first time unit. The com- putation of the runoff hydrograph is shown in Figure 9-14d. In this case, the second ordinate of the runoff hydrograph is the sum of 2 in. times the second ordinate of the UH and 1 in. times the first ordinate of the translated UH: The convolution process can be used for processes with either a discrete or continuous distribution function. For a continuous process the multiplication-translation-additiono pera- tion is made using the convolution integral: Sec. 9.6 Unit Hydrograph Concepts 507 0 0 t Rainfall Rainfall Excess (PE) Excess (PE) 1ID 1 ID Unit Unit Hydrograph Hydrograph (UH) (UH) Unit Hydrograph (UH) 1 1 zl l Direct Direct Runoff (ROI Runoff (RO) 0.4 - rP- Rainfall Excess (PE) P- Unit Hydrograph Unit (UH) Hydrograph (UH) Unit Hydrograph (UH) Direct Runoff (RO) Direct Runoff (RO) 0 D 2D t (b) (d FIGURE 9-14 Convolution: a process of multiplication-translation-addition. in which U(t) is the time distributed UH, y(t) is the time distribution of direct runoff, X(T)i s the computed time distribution of rainfall excess, and is the time lag between the beginning T times of rainfall excess and the unit hydrograph.

The number of ordinates in the di- rect runoff distribution is computed with Equation 9-43: Example 9-13 A 0.1-hr unit hydrograph (Table 9-7) can be used to illustrate convolution in the synthesis phase. The rainfall excess and the unit hydrograph are known and the design runoff hydrograph must be computed. To illustrate this, a design storm with five 6-min increments will be used. The design storm will be derived from values of the intensity-duration-frequency relationship for Coshocton, Ohio. The 5-, lo-, 15, and 30-min rainfall intensities for a 10-yr exceedence fre- quency are 6.1,5.4,4.5, and 3.2 in./hr, respectively. Using regression analysis, the following re- lationship between the rainfall intensity (i) in inches per hour and the duration in hours (D) was computed: This was used to compute the intensity, and then the depth, for durations of 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 min. The estimated depths are given in Table 9-8. Computations for the development of the design storm are given in Table 9-8. From the estimated depths, the incremental depths were computed for each 6-min period. Based on these values the design storm pattern was developed using the method outlined in Section 4.6. The cumulative rainfall was computed, and the cumu- lative rainfall excess was computed using the SCS runoff depth equation (Equation 7-42), with a runoff CN of 84 assumed for estimating the runoff depths. The rainfall excess pattern (column 8 of Table 9-8) was computed by subtracting adjacent values of the cumulative rainfall excess dis- tribution of column 7. The rainfall excess was then convolved with the 6-min unit hydrograph of Table 9-7. The convolution computations are shown in Table 9-9. It is important to notice the multiplication, translation, and addition operations. The unit hydrograph is translated with each time increment, and each burst of rainfall excess is multiplied by the ordinates of the unit hydrograph.

{"paragraph": "9.7.1 Rainfall-Excess Reciprocal Method Before the availability of computers, it was difficult to derive estimates of unit hydrograph ordinates from complex storms. To minimize the necessary computations, only stoms hav- ing simple patterns of rainfall excess were used. When stoms having a rainfall excess dura- tion of T-hours and a fairly uniform intensity could be found, the unit hydrograph was easily derived with the rainfall-excess reciprocal method. This was popular because it is computa- Sec. 9.7 Unit Hydrograph Analysis 51 1 tionally simple. The T-hour unit hydrograph is computed by multiplying each ordinate of the direct runoff hydrograph by the reciprocal of the depth of rainfall excess, which equals the depth of direct runoff. Since the unit hydrograph must have a depth of 1 in. and the direct runoff hydrograph has a volume equivalent to the depth of rainfall excess, the reciprocal of the depth of rainfall excess can be used as a proportionality constant to convert the direct runoff hydrograph to a unit hydrograph. To illustrate the computations involved in unit hydrograph development, assume that a direct runoff hydrograph has the following ordinates: DRO(t) = {40, 70, 50, 20) ft3/sec. As- suming that the ordinates are on a 30-min time interval (the duration of direct runoff is 2 hr) and the watershed area is 35 acres, then the volume of direct runoff is (6zrc)( + + + ft3 )( )(?) (40 70 50 20) --- (30 min) - - sec 35 ac 43560 ft = 2.55in. The unit hydrograph is obtained by dividing each ordinate of the direct runoff hydrograph by 2.55, which yields the unit hydrograph: U(t) = {15.7,27.5, 19.6, 7.8) ft3/sec/in. To check the depth of runoff in the unit hydrograph, follow the same approach used to compute the depth of direct runoff: + + + ft (62zc ' ) ( ) ( )(?) (15.7 27.5 19.6 7.8) --- (30 min) - - sec 35 ac 435l6a0 cft = 1.0in. Thus, U(t) is a unit hydrograph. Example 9-14 The rainfall (in./hr) and runoff (ft3/sec) for the May 13, 1964, storm event on watershed 169, Coshocton, Ohio, are given in columns 8 and 2, respectively, in Table 9-10; the data were recorded at a nonconstant time interval. The watershed has an area of 29 acres, with land use as follows: 6% hardwood, 6% reforested, 48% grassland, 34% cultivated, and 6% miscellaneous, contour strip cropped. In comparing the distributions of rainfall and runoff, it is evident that sig- nificant runoff did not occur before hour 15:35, which is the time at which the peak intensity of rainfall began. Thus rainfall before hour 15:35 was considered to be lost to initial abstraction (column 9 of Table 9-10). The tail of the hydrograph is elongated by the low-intensity rainfall that occurred starting at hour 15:49. Direct runoff was assumed to end with the measured runoff at hour 16:20. To account for the discharge that occurred after hour 16:20, a baseflow was assumed to be present. Use of a baseflow will eliminate sharp discontinuities at the beginning and end of the unit hydrograph. A constant-slope baseflow separation was used; subtracting the baseflow from the total measured runoff yielded the distribution of direct runoff (column 4 of Table 9-10). The accumulated runoff in inches was determined using the trapezoidal rule for the nonconstant time intervals (column 5 of Table 9-10), with a total runoff of 0.1 18 in. Since a unit hydrograph is the dis- charge for 1 in. of rainfall excess, the unit hydrograph can be determined by dividing the ordi- nates of the direct runoff hydrograph by the total runoff of 0.1 18 in. The unit hydrograph is given as column 6 of Table 9-10. To determine the effective duration of the unit hydrograph, it is necessary to separate the measured rainfall into losses and rainfall excess. As indicated previously, rainfall prior to hour 15:35 was considered to be the initial abstraction. Rainfall after hour 16:18 was also eliminated as part of the losses. These two losses are given in column 9 of Table 9-10, with the difference TABLE 9-10 Derivation of Rainfall Excess and a 6-minute Unit Hydrograph for the Storm of 5/13/64 on Watershed 169, Coshocton, Ohio Time Flow Base- Direct 6-Min Rainfall of Day Rate Flow Runoff Accumulation UH Time of Intensity 'a i - Ia Accumulation Losses Rainfall (hr) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (in.)

The total accumulated difference (i - I,) equals 0.83 in. Since the depth of direct runoff equaled 0.1 18 in., the depth of rainfall excess must equal 0.1 18 in., so additional losses of 0.712 in. must be subtracted from the values in column 10. The phi-index method can be used to determine the remaining losses. A first estimate of the phi index is ' 0.712 in. = 0.993 in./hr = (16:18 1535) minl60 - Since this value exceeds the rate of (i - I,) from storm time 15:49 to 16: 18, all of the excess dur- ing this period, which is 0.082 in., will be losses. Thus losses of (0.712 - 0.083) in. = 0.629 in. must be subtracted from the rainfall from storm time 15:35 to 15:49. Thus the revised phi index is ' 0.629 in. = 2.70 in./hr = (1549 - 1535) mi11160 Since this rate exceeds the (i - I,) rate from storm time 15:41 to 15:49, all rainfall excess during this 9-rnin period will be losses, which represents a loss of 0.149 in. Thus losses for the period between storm times 15:35 and 15:41 is (0.629 - 0.149) = 0.48 in. Thus the revised phi index is ' 0.48 in. = 4.8 in./hr = (15:41 - 15:35) mi11160 During the period between storm time 15:35 and 15:41, the loss rate is 4.8 in./hr and the rainfall excess is 1.2 in./hr, which yields an excess volume of 0.12 in.; within roundoff accuracy this agrees with the volume of direct runoff of 0.11 8 in.

{"paragraph": "9.7.2 Least Squares Analysis of Unit Hydrographs Least squares regression is an alternative to the method of Section 9.7.1. The rainfall excess and direct runoff become the predictor and dependent variable, respectively. The least squares procedure was discussed in Chapter 2. While the least squares method has some lim- itations, which will be discussed, it is a convenient method for deriving unit hydrograph or- dinates from rainfall excess and direct runoff ordinates. It is easiest to introduce the least squares method using an example. The example will assume that the distribution of rainfall excess has two ordinates, P, and P,, and the unit hydrograph has three ordinates, U,, U,, and U,. Expressing the relationship between rainfall excess, the unit hydrograph, and the ordi- nates of the direct runoff hydrograph (ri,i = 1, 2, ..., n) using the discrete form of the convo- lution integral provides the following: Equations 9-50 represent four equations and three unknowns, which are the unit hydrograph ordinates. Additionally, the depth of direct runoff must equal 1 area-in. These equations can be expressed in matrix form as follows: Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 which can be simplified to in which P is a 4 x 4 matrix, and both U and R are column vectors with four elements. Since the elements of P and R are known, while the elements of U are unknown, Equation 9-52 can be transformed so that the knowns are on one side of the equation and the unknowns on the other side. Specifically, concepts in matrix algebra provide the following: in which pTi s the transpose of P, P-' is the matrix inverse of P, and I is the identity matrix. The unit hydrograph obtained from Equation 9-53 will very likely need adjusting because of irregularities in the shape. Specifically, either negative ordinates or undulations in the or- dinates of the unit hydrograph recession will probably occur. These irregularities, which are a by-product of the regression method, can be eliminated through either manual smoothing or by fitting a synthetic functional form to the resulting moments. It is also important to en- sure that the ordinates have a sum of 1 area-in. One possible rqethod of smoothing the ordi- nates of a UH with a synthetic form is given in Section 9.8.2. ?;he solution of Equation 9-53 must be obtained using a computer because of the length and complexity of the calcu- lations. Example 9-15 To illustrate the use of Equations 9-53 for deriving a unit hydrograph from the time distributions of rainfall excess (PE) and direct runoff (DRO), the simplest possible problem will be used.

{"paragraph": "9.8 UNIT HYDROGRAPH ADJUSTMENTS In concept, a unit hydrograph reflects the effects that both watershed characteristics and wa- tershed conditions have on rainfall excess. An implicit assumption that the characteristics and conditions are constant for each storm is made. Additionally, it is assumed that rainfall characteristics are not a factor in the shape of the unit hydrograph. In practice, watershed conditions show considerable storm-to-storm variation and the UH analysis procedure does not eliminate the effects of rainfall characteristics. Thus, unit hydrographs analyzed from dif- ferent storms on the same watershed show considerable variation. Storms that dumped a larger portion of the rainfall near the watershed outlet will typically have unit hydrographs that peak earlier than average. A unit storm on a relatively dry watershed will have a delayed peak that is lower than average. The longer time to peak occurs because a larger time period is needed to fulfill initial abstractions and a lower-than-average soil moisture deficit. These 516 Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 differences in storm characteristics and watershed conditions can produce widely different unit hydrographs. Figure 9-16 shows the unit hydrographs for five storm events on the White Oak Bayou, Texas. While three of the five have the shape typical of unit hydrographs, one of the five (the 1959 event) has a flat portion on the rising limb that was probably caused by a pe- riod of low rainfall.

{"paragraph": "9.8.1 S-Hydrograph Method In deriving a unit hydrograph from measured storm data, the characteristics of the unit hy- drograph depend on the effective duration of the rainfall excess. The duration of the excess is important because it must be coordinated with the watershed time of concentration when using the unit hydrograph for design. If it is necessary to transform the unit hydrograph so that it represents a different effective duration of the rainfall excess, the S-hydrograph h he method can be used. S-hydrograph method is based on the idea that, whereas an infinite number of effective durations are possible, only one S-hydrograph exists for a watershed. The S-hydrograph is sometimes referred to as either an S-graph or a summation hydrograph. Given a unit hydrograph for effective duration T, the S-curve can be computed by adding an infinite series of T-hour unit hydrographs, with each T-hour unit hydrograph lagged by T hours. This is shown in Figure 9-17. A series of triangular unit hydrographs are lagged by a time increment of T hours, which is the effective duration of the rainfall excess. The rainfall excess is shown at the top of Figure 9-17, with each burst of rainfall excess hav- FIGURE 9-17 Derivation of an S- Time hydrograph. 518 Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 ing a depth of 1 in. in a period of T hours. Summing the triangular unit hydrographs yields the S-graph shown. The S-graph is unique for each watershed. Mathematically, the i~ ordi- nate of the S-graph, which is denoted as S,, is the sum of all unit hydrograph ordinates, Li,, from the first ordinate to the irho rdinate: This computation applies when the time interval of the unit hydrograph equals the unit dura- tion of the unit hydrograph. When using an S-curve to derive a unit hydrograph for a duration other than the dura- tion of the unit hydrograph that was used to develop the S-curve, it is necessary for the ordi- nates to be recorded on the time interval of the shorter of the two durations. For example, if an S-curve is derived from a 10-min unit hydrograph and a 20-min unit hydrograph is needed, the ordinates must be recorded on a 10-rnin interval. However, if a 5-rnin unit hydro- graph is needed, the ordinates must be recorded on a 5-min interval. In this case, the interme- diate points must be interpolated from the S-curve. When values are interpolated from the S- graph, it is important to ensure that the sum of the ordinates is equivalent to 1 area-in. This will occur if linear interpolation between points on the S-graph is used; however, linear inter- polation from the S-graph should be avoided because it will always result in a peak discharge for the shorter-duration unit hydrograph that is smaller than the peak of the longer-duration unit hydrograph. This is not rational since the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph should increase as the duration of the rainfall excess decreases. Thus, selecting intermediate points from the S-graph should take into account the nonlinear nature of the S-graph, but the inter- polation must be done in a way that ensures a volume of 1.0 area-in. of direct runoff. Example 9-16 The 6-min unit hydrograph of Table 9-10 can be used to illustrate the derivation of an S-graph. However, to use the unit hydrograph it must first be restructured so that it is measured on an equal-interval time scale, with the scale equal to the effective duration of 6 min; at the same time, it is necessary to maintain a volume of 1 area-in. An objective means for converting a unit hydrograph recorded on an unequal interval to a unit hydrograph for a constant time interval is not available. However, an approximation is shown in Figure 9-18. The ordinates are given in column 2 of Table 9-1 la. The ordinates were adjusted to ensure that the volume equaled 1 area- in. and that both the shape and magnitude were similar to the unit hydrograph derived for the un- equal time increment. Based on the 6-min unit hydrograph of equal time intervals, the S-graph was derived with Equation 9-58. The S-graph is given as column 3 in Table 9-1 la. The S-graph was then offset by 12 min (column 4 of Table 9-1 la) and the differences between the two S-graphs computed (column 5 of Table 9-1 la). Since the differences have a volume of 2 area-in., each ordinate was halved, which provides a 12-min unit hydrograph (column 6 of Table 9-1 la). The 12-min unit hydrograph is shown in Figure 9-18. In general, the longer duration unit hydrograph will be less peaked and may have a delayed time to peak; this is evident from the 12-min unit hydrograph in Figure 9-18. To compute a unit hydrograph for effective durations shorter than that used to drive the S-graph, it is necessary to interpolate interior points from the S-graph and use a time interval equal to the effective duration for which the unit hydrograph is needed. To derive a 3-min unit Sec. 9.8 Unit Hydrograph Adjustments Storm Time (min) FIGURE 9-18 Unit hydrographs for 3 minutes (8-*8),6 minutes (A- -A), and (m- -a), 12 minutes - with 6-minute unit hydrograph from measured data (00). hydrograph from the 6-min unit hydrograph, values were interpolated at a 3-min increment from the S-graph of Figure 9-19. The values are given in column 7 of Table 9-1 la. The S-graph was then offset by 3 min (column 8) and the differences (column 9) computed. For the 3-min unit hy- drograph to have a unit volume, it is necessary to double each ordinate of column 9, which yields the unit hydrograph of column 10 in Table 9-1 la. The 3-min unit hydrograph is shown in Figure 9-18. The peak is slightly greater than that of the 6-min unit hydrograph and the rising limb occurs sooner. Example 9-17 A unit hydrograph recorded on a time interval of 20 min is given in column 2 of Table 9-1 lb. The S-hydrograph is given in column 3. A 10-rnin unit hydrograph can be derived from the 20-min unit hydrograph by interpolating between the ordinates of the 20-min S-hydrograph. Since linear interpolation might seem like the obvious choice, an S-graph for a 10-min interval was derived using linear interpolation (see column 4). The S-graph was offset by 10 rnin (see column 5), and the differences computed (column 6). The 10-min unit hydrograph is given in column 7. Two points are especially noteworthy. First, the peak discharge did not change signif- icantly, increasing slightly because of rounding errors from 1981 ft3/sec to 1982 ft3/sec. Second, adjacent ordinates of the unit hydrograph are essentially the same, which is not rational. This ex- ample shows that linear interpolation should not be used when fonning unit hydrographs of shorter durations. An S-graph was formed using nonlinear interpolation (see column 8 of Table 9-1 lb). The S-curve was offset and the differences computed. The 10-min unit hydrograph was computed (column 11). Both problems identified for linear interpolation were avoided by using nonlinear interpolation. The peak discharge for the 10-min unit hydrograph, 2012 ft3/sec, represents an in- crease of 1.6% over the peak of the 20-min unit hydrograph. 520 Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 TABLE 9-1 1 S-graph Analysis Results: (a) Derivation of 3-minute and 12-minute Unit Hydrographs from 6- minute Unit Hydrographs using S-graph Offset Method Storm 6-min Offset 12 -min Offset 3-min Time UH S-graph S-graph AS UH S-graph S-graph AS UH (min) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (b) Comparison of the Effect of Linear and Nonlinear Interpolation of S-graphs on Computed Unit Hydrograph Nonlinear 20411 Linear Offset 10-min Nonlinear Offset 10 -min Time UH S-graph S-graph S-graph AS UH S-graph S-graph AS UH (min) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) (ft3/sec) Sec. 9.8 Unit Hydrograph Adjustments Storm Time (min) FIGURE 9-19 S-hydrograph for storm event of 5/13/64 on Watershed 169, Coshocton, Ohio.

{"paragraph": "9.8.2 Gamma Distribution Unit Hydrograph When unit hydrographs are derived from measured data, the ordinates must be smoothed to provide a reasonable shape. To provide for a systematically varying shape, it may be prefer- able to use a probability function and use the moments of the measured-data unit hydrograph to fit the parameters of the probability function. Aron and White (1982) provided a method of estimating the parameters of a gamma probability distribution using the peak discharge and time to peak of a computed unit hydrograph. The gamma distribution has the form in which a and b are called the shape and scale parameters, respectively; and T(a) is the gamma function with argument a. The parameters a and b are obtained from the computed peak discharge qp and the time to peak tp of the unit hydrograph using the folIowing steps: Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 1.

The following steps are used to average two or more unit hydrographs that were com- puted from different storm events on the same watershed: 1. Compute the average peak discharge. 2. Compute the average time to peak. 3. Plot each of the storm event UHs on a single graph. 4. Locate the point defined by the average peak discharge and average time to peak from Steps 1 and 2. 5. Sketch a unit hydrograph that represents an average of the shapes of the storm event UHs and passes through the point defined in Step 4. 6. Read off the ordinates of the average unit hydrograph sketched in Step 5 and compute the volume of the average UH. 7. Adjust the ordinates of the sketched UH so that it has a volume of 1 area-in.; the ad- justments are usually made in the recession of the UH. This averaging method assumes that all of the storm event UHs have approximately the same unit duration. If they do not, they should be adjusted using the S-hydrograph method prior to averaging.

If this were done, the watershed-average UH would have a low peak discharge and the shape would not be representative of the true unit hydrograph. Example 9-19 Figure 9-16 shows unit hydrographs for five storm events on White Oak Bayou, Texas; the data were adapted from graphs provided by Hare (1970). The ordinates are given in Table 9-13. White Oak Bayou has a drainage area of 92 sq. mi. The peak discharge and time to peak are given in Table 9-13 for each storm UH; the averages are also given. The point defined by 4, and - tp is located on Figure 9-16 with the five storm event UHs. A smooth distribution was sketched through the point, with consideration given to the shapes of the five storm event unit hydro- graphs.

{"paragraph": "9.9 SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPHS To this point the discussion has centered about the analysis problem. The objective has been to derive the unit hydrograph from the measured storm data. The example of Section 9.6.2 (Example 9-13) assumed that the design storm was applied to the same watershed from which the unit hydrograph was derived. But at almost all locations where a design is neces- sary, rainfall and runoff data are not available to derive both a unit hydrograph and an S-curve for the watershed. Therefore, a need to have unit hydrographs that can be used at such ungaged locations exists. These are often referred to as regionalized or synthetic unit hydrographs. It is preferable to use a unit hydrograph only for designs on watersheds that are similar to the watersheds used in developing the unit hydrograph. Thus the term regional unit hydrograph would suggest that the unit hydrograph was developed from watersheds in a region that have similar watershed characteristics and meteorological conditions. The re- gional or synthetic unit hydrographs are developed from the analysis of measured storm data and then used on ungaged locations. To use the regionalized unit hydrographs on other wa- tersheds, they are usually made dimensionless so that they can be applied to watersheds that have a wide range of watershed characteristics. A number of synthetic unit hydrographs have been proposed and are used. Time-area diagrams, which are based on the cumulative proportion of a watershed that supposedly con- tributes runoff to the watershed outlet as the storm time increases, have been used in a num- ber of models as the basis for representing the unit hydrograph.

However, this also means that the applicability of regional unit hydrographs may be limited to areas with similar characteristics, emphasizing the need for a diverse range of regional models to cover different hydrological scenarios.

{"paragraph": "9.9.1 Time-Area Unit Hydrographs A time-area curve is an S-graph with the abscissa as the travel time and the ordinate asthe cu- mulative proportion of the total watershed that contributes runoff for a specified travel time. The ordinate can alternatively be shown as the cumulative area contributing. The derivative of the S-graph would be a unit hydrograph or, if expressed as a proportion, a distribution graph. The time base of the unit hydrograph equals the time of concentration, so it must be a special form of a unit hydrograph called the instantaneous UH (IUH). The time-area UH is the result of a burst of rainfall that has 1-in. of excess and occurs over an infinitesimally small duration. Consider the watershed shown in Figure 9-21a. The watershed is divided into 59 sub- areas of equal area. The travel time from the subarea to the outlet is shown in the section, with all subareas contributing to the outlet within 14 time units. The distribution of subareas Sec. 9.9 Synthetic Unit Hydrographs Time Units FIGURE 9-21 Time-Area Unit Hydro- graph Development: (a) Watershed and Travel Times; (b) Contributing Area Time Units (c) versus Time; (c) S-Hydrograph. contributing for each time is shown in Figure 9-21b. The cumulative distribution of Figure 9-21b is shown in Figure 9-21c; this is the time-area diagram. The time base of the time- area diagram equals the time of concentration, which is 14 time units. The instantaneous unit hydrograph of Figure 9-21b indicates that runoff ceases at the time of concentration, which occurs because rainfall occurred over an infinitesimally small time interval. The time-area diagram and the instantaneous unit hydrograph reflect runoff due to translation only, with no storage effects. Since this is not realistic to use for design, it is com- Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 mon to route the instantaneous UH through a single linear reservoir (SLR) to represent the effects of storage. The single linear reservoir is given by in which K is the routing coefficient. It is common practice to assume that the routing coeffi- cient equals the time lag, which is usually assumed to equal 60% of the time of concentration. Routing the time-area UH through a single linear reservoir will lower the peak discharge, delay the time to peak, and lengthen the time base; these changes are assumed to reflect the effects of watershed storage. When applying the SLR of Equation 9-66, it is necessary to have the sum of the ordinates equal 1. The usual practice for applying the SLR is to present the SLR as a series of discrete ordinates and convolve the SLR with the time-area UH. The advantage of the time-area curve is that it has a realistic conceptual basis. The problem with its use is the fact that, in spite of the number of studies of the time-area SLR approach, its accuracy has not been convincingly verified. In some cases, other models, most notably the gamma distribution or Nash Model, have shown to provide results that are more accurate than those from Equation 9-66. However, accurate methods of computing K of the SLR model or the parameters of the gamma distribution have proven to be illusive. Thus, the approach is not widely used on ungaged watersheds. An alternative to the routing through the SLR is to use a storm having a duration other than the infinitesimally small duration of the IUH. For example, a constant-intensity storm that has a duration equal to the time of concentration is widely used, with the belief that such a storm would produce the maximum peak discharge. The following computations illustrate the process. Assume that the watershed consists of six equal subareas, as shown in Figure 9-22a, and that the rainfall hyetograph is as shown in Figure 9-22b. The rainfall duration equals the time of concentration for the watershed. The storm has a constant intensity i. The distribution of rainfall excess is also shown in Figure 9-22b, with a magnitude of Ci, where C is a runoff * coefficient of the Rational Method; thus the loss function is constant with a magnitude of i (1-C). The initial abstraction is assumed to be part of the losses. Based on the assumption that the rainfall is uniformly distributed over the watershed, the depth of rainfall excess Ci is assumed to fall on each subarea of the watershed. At the end of time tJ3 runoff from only subarea 1 will be arriving at the watershed outlet. Assuming that runoff from subareas 2, 3, and 4 have equal travel times to the watershed outlet, which equal 2tJ3, then at the end of time 2tJ3 subareas 1 to 4 will be contributing runoff at the outlet. This is shown in the hydro- graph of Figure 9-22c. At time 2tJ3 rain that fell on subareas 5 and 6 would not contribute to direct runoff at the outlet. At time t, all six subareas are contributing to runoff at the outlet, which is reflected in the ordinate of the hydrograph. At time t, the storm has reached its dura- tion. During the time interval from t, to 4tJ3 rain that fell during time interval tJ3 to 2tJ3 is still contributing runoff at the outlet from subareas 5 and 6, and rain that fell during the time interval 2tJ3 to t, is contributing runoff from subareas 2, 3, and 4. Thus the runoff ordinate equals 5 units (see Figure 9-22c). Rain that fell during the time interval from 2tJ3 to t, on subareas 5 and 6 appears as runoff at the outlet in the time interval 4 tJ3 to 5tJ3 (see Table 9-14). It is also important to observe that the depth of rainfall excess, Cit,, equals the depth of direct runoff; the depths can be converted to volumes by multiplying by the total area, A.

Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 TABLE 9-14 Time-Area Analysis of Hypothetical Watershed Subarea Contributing Runoff Measured Runoff to Outlet Rainfall Occurring at Outlet During During Time Time Interval 1 2, 3,4 5,6 Interval The above analysis is somewhat misleading because the rainfall excess and direct runoff are used with a relatively large, discrete time interval, tJ3. The last particle of rainfall excess falling at the upper end of subarea 5 or 6 at time tc will require a travel time to the outlet of t,, which means that it will appear as runoff at the outlet at time 2tc. The runoff hy- drograph of Figure 9-22c suggests that this particle of rainfall reaches the outlet at 5tJ3. The difference is due to the discretizing of the calculations. If the time interval, At, goes from rj3 to an infinitesimally small time period, the analysis will yield a hydrograph with a shape similar to that of Figure 9-22e but with a time base equal to 2tc. The peak still equals Ci and occurs at time t,. This can be shown empirically by using successively smaller time incre- ments. For a time increment of tJ6, which is one-half of the time increment used above, we separate the watershed as shown in Figure 9-22d. This produces the direct runoff hydro- graph shown in Figure 9-22e. In this case, the time base of the direct runoff hydrograph is 1l tJ6; this supports the statement that the time base will approach 2t, as the time increment At goes to 0. For a rectangular watershed of length L and width W the direct runoff hydrograph will have the shape of an isosceles triangle, with a peak Ci and a time base of 2tc. Actual water- sheds do not have square edges like the schematic Figure 9-22a, and they are not rectangu- lar. Instead, they appear more elliptical. In such a case, the hydrograph will have a shape such as that shown in Figure 9-22f. Example 9-20 Figure 9-23a shows a topographic map of watershed Wl in Treynor, Iowa. The watershed has a drainage area of 74.5 acres, with 39, 13, 36, and 12% of the watershed in the slope ranges of 2-4,5-8,9-13, and 14-19%, respectively; a slope map is shown as Figure 9-23b. The principal waterway has a length of 3500 ft, with 5% of the drainage area as gully and grassed waterways. The remaining 95% of the land is in corn and contoured with a high level of fertility and good farming practices. To compute the time-area curve, the relationship between slope and velocity for the grassed waterways is V = 1.5p5 (Figure 3-19) and for contoured corn, the relationship is V = 0.59.~U. sing the slope and topographic maps (Figure 9-23b and a, respectively), iso-time lines were constructed using a time increment of 2 min (see Figure 9-23c). The travel distance for the 2-min time increments was determined using Equation 3-42, with the velocity computed as a function of slope and flow regime. The iso-time map of Figure 9-23c was used to compute the time-area curve shown in Figure 9-34. This is a valid S-graph.

The ordinates of both the time-area curve and the IUH are given in columns 2 and 4 of Table 9-15, respectively. The time of concentration for the watershed is 25.5 rnin, which yields a time lag of 15.3 min; this is used as the routing coefficient of Equation 9-66, which was used to compute the SLR function given in column 5 of Table 9-15. The sum of the ordinates computed with Equation 9-66 was used to adjust the ordinates of the SLR to a unit volume. The SLR was convolved with the IUH to produce the routed unit hydrograph (column 6 of Table 9-15). The IUH has a peak of 410 ft3/sec and a time to peak of 14 min. The routed UH has a peak of 220 ft3/sec and a time to peak of 18 min. A time to peak of 18 min seems reasonable since the relationship t, = 2t)3 is commonly used. The changes in qp and tp reflect the smoothing effect of the routing. The time base of the routed unit hydrograph doubled because the time base of the SLR equaled the time base of the IUH.

This variability underscores the importance of considering watershed geometry in hydrologic analyses."}, {"question": "In the context of time-area unit hydrographs, what challenges are associated with verifying the accuracy of the time-area SLR approach?", "answer": "One of the challenges is that, despite numerous studies, the accuracy of the time-area SLR approach has not been convincingly verified. This lack of verification is partly due to the difficulty in accurately determining the routing coefficient (K) of the SLR model or the parameters of alternative models like the gamma distribution. As a result, the approach is not widely used for ungaged watersheds, highlighting the need for further research and validation to establish reliable methods for computing these critical parameters."}, {"question": "Why is the time-area curve considered to have a realistic conceptual basis?", "answer": "The time-area curve is based on the concept that runoff from different parts of a watershed contributes to the outlet at different times, depending on the travel time from each area. This concept reflects the physical processes of runoff generation and travel, making the time-area curve a fundamentally sound approach. However, the challenge lies in accurately quantifying these travel times and the proportions of the watershed contributing at each time interval, which requires detailed knowledge of the watershed's topography, land use, and hydrologic characteristics."}, {"question": "How does the discretization of time intervals affect the accuracy of time-area analysis?", "answer": "The discretization of time intervals can lead to inaccuracies in time-area analysis. For example, using a large discrete time interval can result in a hydrograph that suggests runoff from certain areas reaches the outlet later than it actually does, due to the assumption that all runoff from an area contributes at the end of the time interval. Reducing the time interval can improve the accuracy by capturing the continuous nature of runoff contribution more closely, but it also increases the complexity of the analysis. The ideal approach would involve using"}]}
{"paragraph": "9.9.2 Hydrograph Assumptions of the Rational Method The Rational Method was previously introduced as a method for estimating peak discharges. The development of the Rational Method made several assumptions: 1 The rainfall-i ntensity, i, is constant over the storm duration. 2. The rainfall is uniformly distributed over the watershed. 3. The maximum rate of runoff will occur when runoff is being contributed to the outlet from the entire watershed. 4. The peak rate of runoff equals some fraction of the rainfall intensity. 5. The watershed system is linear. These assumptions can be used to develop a hydrograph. One of several possible assumptions can be made to formulate the hydrograph. The easiest solution would be as follows: 1 Estimate the peak discharge of the runoff hydrograph from Equation 7-20. 2. Assume that the runoff hydrograph is an isosceles triangle with a time to peak equal to t, and a time base of 2tc. This method would produce a hydrograph with 50% of the volume under the rising limb of the hydrograph and a total volume of CiAt,. The assumption of an isosceles triangle would probably be reasonable for most design problems on small urban watersheds. To ob- tain a more realistic description of the runoff hydrograph, the shape of the hydrograph can be determined from the time-area curve, as suggested earlier. If assumption 1 above is used, namely q, = CiA, the time base of the hydrograph must equal 2tc if a triangular shape is assumed. A time base longer than 2tc will result in more runoff than rainfall. To demonstrate this, assume the rainfall hyetograph has a constant intensity i over a duration t,. The volume of rainfall is iAt,, and the volume of rainfall excess is CiAt,. If the peak discharge of the direct runoff hydrograph is CiA then the volume of direct runoff, as- suming a triangular shape, is 112 CiATb where Tb is the time base. In order for the volume of direct runoff to equal the volume of rainfall excess, Tb must equal 2tc. If it were assumed to equal 4t,, then the volume of direct runoff would be twice the volume of rainfall excess. Regardless of the assumption about the shape of the hydrograph, the use of the Ratio- nal Method has advantages and disadvantages. Certainly, it is subject to the limitations of the Rational Equation (Equation 7-4). However, it is easy to develop, and the accuracy should be sufficient for designs on small, highly urbanized watersheds. A unit hydrograph is inherent in the Rational Method. Since the volume of the unit hy- drograph must equal 1 area-in., the ordinates of the UH can be determined by multiplying each ordinate of the direct runoff hydrograph of the Rational Method by the conversion fac- tor K: Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 in which i and t, are in./hr and hr, respectively. Thus the peak discharge of the unit hydro- graph will be Kq,. Example 9-21 For C = 0.4, i = 3 in./hr, A = 14 acres, and t, = 0.25 hr, the direct runoff would have a peak dis- charge of 16.8 ft3/sec, the conversion factor K would equal 3.33, and the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph would be 56 ft3/sec. For a 14-acre watershed that has a UH with a time base of 0.5 hr and a peak discharge of 56 ft3/sec, the volume is 1 in. Example 9-22 The case of Example 7-1 1 and Figure 7-1 can be used to illustrate the application of the Ratio- nal Formula with runoff hydrographs. The assumption is made that the passage of the hydro- graph from a subarea through a pipe occurs with translation and no attenuation. This may be a reasonable assumption for short pipe lengths. This method also assumes that the pipe has the ca- pacity to pass the peak discharge and that the inlet does not constrict the flow. These are reason- able assumptions for design. The isosceles-triangle hydrographs have a time base of 2t,, a peak computed with the Rational Formula, and a beginning time equal to the travel time from the sub- area outlet through the pipe to the design point. The discharge hydrograph from subarea 1 is translated to the outlet of subarea 2, where it is added to the discharge hydrograph from subarea 2 (see Table 9-16). Notice that the subarea-2 hydrograph begins at time t = 0 because translation is not necessary; however, the subarea-1 hy- drograph has a 3-min travel time through the pipe to the junction at subarea 2. Therefore, it be- gins at a time of 3-min. At subarea 2, the peak of the total discharge hydrograph occurs at t = 9 min and has a magnitude of 18.2 cfs, which is 2.6 cfs greater than the peak of the subarea-2 hy- drograph. At the junction at subarea-3 inlet, the total hydrograph has a peak of 28.1 cfs. Most of this is due to subarea-3 runoff, although runoff from all three subareas contribute to the discharge at that time (t, = 7 min). The subarea-] hydrograph begins at t = 6, with a 3-min translation be- tween inlet 1 and junction 2 and another 3-min translation between junctions 2 and 3. In Example 7-1 1, the method provided an estimate of 37.4 ft3/sec for the entire 18.9 acres. The analysis in this example provides an estimate of 28.1 ft3/sec, which is 23% lower. Which is correct? Unfortunately, we cannot say that one estimate is correct and the other is in- correct. Both are based on assumptions for which valid arguments can be made. The method of Example 7-1 1 lumps the watershed characteristics together by computing mean values of the runoff coefficient; thus, it does not take into consideration the spatial variation in land use. The method of this section assumes perfect translation of the pipeflow. This may not be realistic. The method of Example 7-1 1 ignores the difference between pipeflow and surface runoff. Proce- dures in addition to the two described here are used. In practice, the method used depends on local policies and practices.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the Rational Method for estimating peak discharges, what assumptions are made regarding rainfall intensity and distribution?", "answer": "The Rational Method assumes that the rainfall intensity is constant over the storm duration and that the rainfall is uniformly distributed over the watershed."}, {"question": "How does the assumption of an isosceles triangle for the runoff hydrograph affect the volume of direct runoff in relation to the volume of rainfall excess?", "answer": "The assumption of an isosceles triangle for the runoff hydrograph results in a specific relationship between the time base of the hydrograph and the storm duration. If the time base equals 2tc, the volume of direct runoff equals the volume of rainfall excess. However, if the time base is longer than 2tc, the volume of direct runoff will exceed the volume of rainfall excess. For instance, assuming a time base of 4tc would result in the volume of direct runoff being twice the volume of rainfall excess. This highlights the importance of accurately determining the time base in hydrograph analysis to ensure that the volume of direct runoff is correctly estimated."}, {"question": "Why is the Rational Method subject to limitations, and what are its advantages in certain design scenarios?", "answer": "The Rational Method is subject to the limitations of the Rational Equation, which may not fully capture the complexities of runoff processes. However, it has advantages in being easy to develop and providing sufficient accuracy for designs on small, highly urbanized watersheds. The method's simplicity and applicability to specific contexts make it a useful tool in hydrological analysis, despite its limitations. Its ease of use and the inherent unit hydrograph within the method facilitate the estimation of peak discharges and the analysis of runoff hydrographs, which are crucial in urban watershed design."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis, how does the conversion factor K relate to the unit hydrograph and the direct runoff hydrograph?", "answer": "The conversion factor K is used to determine the ordinates of the unit hydrograph (UH) from the direct runoff hydrograph of the Rational Method. By multiplying each ordinate of the direct runoff hydrograph by K, the ordinates of the UH can be calculated. This process ensures that the volume of the unit hydrograph equals 1 area-in, allowing for the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph to be determined. For example, given specific values of runoff coefficient C, rainfall intensity i, area A, and storm duration t, the conversion factor K can be calculated, and then used to find the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph."}, {"question": "What implications does the assumption of perfect translation of pipeflow have on the estimation of peak discharges in watershed analysis?", "answer": "The assumption of perfect translation of pipeflow implies that the hydrograph from a subarea is translated to the outlet without attenuation, which may not be realistic. This assumption can affect the accuracy of peak discharge estimates, as it does not account for potential losses or changes in the flow regime during translation. In practice, this assumption may lead to overestimation or underestimation of peak discharges, depending on the specific conditions of the watershed and the pipe network. Therefore, it is essential to consider the limitations of this assumption and potentially incorporate more complex flow routing methods to improve the accuracy of hydrological analyses."}, {"question": "Why do different methods for estimating peak discharges, such as those described in Examples 7-11 and 9-22, yield different results, and what does this imply for hydrological practice?", "answer": "Different methods for estimating peak discharges yield different results because they are based on different assumptions and simplifications of the complex processes involved in runoff generation and flow routing. For instance, the method in Example 7-11 lumps watershed characteristics together, ignoring spatial variations in land use, while the method in Example 9-22 assumes perfect translation of pipeflow. These differences in assumptions and approaches can lead to variations in estimated peak discharges, as seen in the examples. This implies that hydrological practice must consider the strengths and limitations of various methods and the specific context of the analysis. Practitioners must carefully evaluate the assumptions and choose the most appropriate method based on the characteristics of the watershed, the availability of data, and the requirements of the design or analysis task. This highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of hydrological processes and the ability to critically evaluate different methods and their underlying assumptions."}, {"question": "In the context of unit hydrographs, how is the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph determined, and what is its significance in hydrograph analysis?", "answer": "The peak discharge of the unit hydrograph is determined by multiplying the peak discharge of the direct runoff hydrograph by the conversion factor K. This process ensures that the volume of the unit hydrograph equals 1 area-in, allowing for the comparison of runoff responses from different watersheds. The unit hydrograph is significant in hydrograph analysis because it provides a standardized representation of the runoff response,"}]}

OOO The constant 484 reflects a unit hydrograph that has 318 of its area under the rising limb. For mountainous watersheds the fraction could be expected to be greater than 318, and therefore, the constant of Equation 9-71 may be near 600. For flat, swampy areas the constant may be less than 300. The time to peak of Equation 9-71 can be expressed in terms of the duration of unit rainfall excess and the time of concentration.

{"paragraph": "9.9.4 Snyder F. F. Snyder (1938) provided a method of developing a synthetic unit hydrograph that is widely used. The method is most appropriate for large watersheds, but calibration of the co- efficients is recommended. Formation of the unit hydrograph depends on a number of ele- ments, including the time to peak, the time base, the duration of the rainfall excess, the peak discharge, and the width of the unit hydrograph at both 50% and 75% of the peak discharge. The time of the peak of the unit hydrograph depends on two time elements, the dura- tion of the rainfall excess (t,) and the time lag (t,), which is defined for this model as the time between the center of mass of rainfall excess and the time of the peak discharge. Snyder re- lated the time lag (t,, hours) to (1) the length of the main channel (L, miles) measured from the watershed outlet to the basin divide; (2) a watershed shape parameter (LC,i n miles), which is the length measured along the main channel from the watershed outlet to a point on the main channel that is perpendicular to the center of the area of the watershed (see Section 3.5); and (3) a watershed storage coefficient C,, which should be calibrated. The following relationship is used to compute the lag time: Sec. 9.9 Synthetic Unit Hydrographs 541 Values of C, are typically believed to range from 1.8 to 2.2. The duration of rainfall excess (t,, in hours) can be computed by the empirical equation Equation 9-81 indicates that the relationship between lag time and the duration of rainfall excess is constant. The following equation can be used to provide adjusted values of the lag time for other values of the duration of rainfall excess: in which t, is the alternative unit hydrograph duration (hr) and t , is the adjusted time lag (hr). The time to peak is given by The adjusted lag of Equation 9-82 can be used in place oft, in Equation 9-80. The time base of the unit hydrograph (t,) is a function of the time lag: in which tb has units of days. Equation 9-84 is intended for use on large watersheds so it would give excessively large values for small watersheds. For small and moderately sized watersheds, the time base can be set as a ratio of the time to peak, with three to five times being reasonable values according to the studies behind the SCS methods, as well as others. The unit peak discharge (q,, ft3/sec/in.) of the unit hydrograph is given by 640 AC, qp = tL in which A is the drainage area (mi2) and Cp is the second empirical coefficient of the Snyder Method. Both Cp of Equation 9-85 and C, of Equation 9-80 should be calibrated. However, values of Cp are believed to range from 0.5 to 0.7. The shape of Snyder's Unit Hydrograph is largely controlled by two time parameters, W,, and W,,. These are the time widths of the unit hydrograph at discharges of 50% and 75% of the peak discharge computed with Equation 9-85. Values for W,, and W,, are given by and in which qa is the peak discharge per square mile (qdA, ft3/sec/mi2).A s a rule of practice, the location of the end points of W,, and W,, are placed such that one-third of both W,, and W,, occur prior to the time to peak and the remaining two-thirds after the time to peak. Thus seven points are used to define critical points of the unit hydrograph (see Figure 9-29). A smooth curvilinear shape should be drawn through these seven points and the volume of the UH computed. Adjustments to the ordinates can then be made so that the shape of the unit hydrograph is reasonable and the volume equals 1 area-in. of direct runoff. The adjustments are usually made in the recession of the UH. Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 FIGURE 9-29 Configuration of Snyder's Synthetic Unit Hydrograph.

The coefficients C, and Cp have typical ranges (1.8 to 2.2 for C, and 0.5 to 0.7 for Cp), but these can vary based on the specific watershed characteristics, emphasizing the need for calibration to ensure the model accurately represents the watershed's hydrological behavior."}, {"question": "In the context of Snyder's Unit Hydrograph, how is the time base determined, and what considerations are made for small and moderately sized watersheds?", "answer": "The time base (t,) of the unit hydrograph is determined by the equation t, = 5t, for large watersheds. However, for small and moderately sized watersheds, this equation may yield excessively large values. Instead, the time base can be set as a ratio of the time to peak, with three to five times being reasonable values. This adjustment is necessary because the original equation is intended for large watersheds and does not account for the different hydrological characteristics of smaller watersheds."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the unit peak discharge (q,) in Snyder's Method, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "The unit peak discharge (q,) is significant because it represents the peak flow rate per unit area of the watershed. It is calculated using the equation q, = 640 * AC, / t, where A is the drainage area, and Cp is an empirical coefficient that should be calibrated. The value of Cp typically ranges from 0.5 to 0.7, but like C,, it requires calibration for accurate representation of the watershed's hydrological response."}, {"question": "How do the time widths W, and W, influence the shape of Snyder's Unit Hydrograph, and what rule of practice is applied to their placement?", "answer": "The time widths W, and W, which are the times at which the discharge is 50% and 75% of the peak discharge, respectively, significantly influence the shape of the unit hydrograph. A rule of practice is to place the end points of W, and W, such that one-third of both widths occur prior to the time to peak and the remaining two-thirds after the time to peak. This placement helps in defining the critical points of the unit hydrograph and ensures a realistic representation of the hydrograph's shape."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to adjust the ordinates of the unit hydrograph after its initial computation, and what is the goal of these adjustments?", "answer": "Adjustments to the ordinates of the unit hydrograph are necessary to ensure that the volume under the hydrograph equals 1 area-in. of direct runoff. The initial computation may not yield a volume that matches this requirement, so adjustments, typically made in the recession part of the hydrograph, are needed to achieve the correct volume. This process involves modifying the shape of the hydrograph, often by using curved lines instead of straight lines to connect the critical points, to make it more realistic and to satisfy the volume condition."}, {"question": "In the context of developing a unit hydrograph using Snyder's Method, what inputs are required, and how do these inputs affect the outcome?", "answer": "To develop a unit hydrograph, inputs such as the drainage area (A), the watershed length (L), the length to the center of area (LC), and the fitting coefficients (C, and Cp) are required. These inputs significantly affect the outcome because they determine the time lag, peak discharge, and shape of the unit hydrograph. Accurate estimation of these inputs, especially through calibration of C, and Cp, is crucial for obtaining a reliable"}]}
{"paragraph": "9.10 DESIGNING WITH HYDROGRAPHS Peak discharge methods are widely used in hydrologic design, especially for small water- sheds and for highway drainage. Urban drainage design also makes use of peak discharge methods. These methods have the advantage of being computationally simple to apply and they provide a reasonable level of accuracy. Historically, peak discharge methods were used almost exclusively because of the complexity of hydrograph design. The availability of com- puters has eliminated this constraint. Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 Computer models based on hydrographs are believed to be more accurate than peak discharge methods, at least when the assumptions commonly specified for peak discharge methods are obviously violated. Watershed size is considered to be a very important criterion for selection of a design method, with peak discharge equations appropriate for small water- sheds and hydrograph methods preferred for moderate and large watersheds. Unfortunately, it is difficult to decide on a line of demarcation between small and not-so-small watersheds. It is difficult to specify a delimiting area since peak discharge equations may be appropriate for an area A in a steeply sloped region but inappropriate for a watershed of the same size in a coastal area, where low slopes and sandy soils dominate. Hydrograph methods are believed to be appropriate where one or more of the follow- ing conditions exist: (1) significant amounts of natural or developed storage, such as natu- rally swampy areas or small urban detention reservoirs; (2) significant variations in water- shed or hydrometeorological conditions exist, including differences in land use, soil, hydrologic condition, topography or rainfall characteristics; (3) projects where watershed subdivision will be necessary for coordinating the design of different flood and drainage pro- jects; and (4) where there are constraints in the principal flow paths, such as those caused by bridge abutments or encroachments in the flood plain. Where such conditions exist, hydro- graph designs are more appropriate than peak discharge methods. Where hydrograph design is warranted, the following procedure should be followed: 1. Select a design storm and design return period; this is discussed in Chapter 4. 2. For larger areas, make appropriate depth-area adjustments. 3. Compute initial abstractions and losses to separate the rainfall excess from the total rainfall. 4. Select a unit hydrograph model and obtain the inputs necessary to put it in dimensional form; make sure that the resulting UH has a volume of 1 acre-in. 5. Convolve the rainfall excess hyetograph with the unit hydrograph to compute the di- rect runoff hydrograph. 6. Add baseflow to the direct runoff hydrograph to compute the total runoff hydrograph. 7. Where the watershed has been subdivided, the total runoff hydrograph will have to be routed through the channel system (see Chapter 10). This procedure forms the conceptual basis of computer programs such as the SCS TR-20 and Corps of Engineers HEC- 1. 9.1 1 SCS WATERSHED MODEL: TR-20 In comparison with many other watershed models, the SCS TR-20 model is relatively sim- ple, both in terms of the input and the conceptual framework. It is a single-event model that is usually used with a design storm as input. The program was formulated to develop runoff hydrographs, route hydrographs through channel reaches and reservoirs, and combine or sep- arate hydrographs at confluences. Runoff hydrographs are developed using the SCS runoff equation and the SCS curvilinear unit hydrograph. Hydrographs are routed through channel Sec. 9.1 1 SCS Watershed Model: TR-20 545 reaches using the modified Att-Kin Method (see Chapter lo), and the storage-indication method is used for reservoir routing. The program is designed to make multiple analyses in a single run so that various alternatives can be evaluated in one pass through the program; this leads to more efficient use of computer time. Additionally, a single option can be used; for example, the storage routing algorithm can be used in the design of a detention basin. 9.11 .1 Watershed Modeling The TR-20 program, as well as other watershed models, are especially useful for developing design hydrographs on nonhomogeneous watersheds. Consider a watershed where four dis- tinct subwatersheds with different land covers have been delineated. The two upper subwa- tersheds, both of which drain to the headwater of a channel, differ in land use, with one being developed in single-family residential units and the other predominantly forested. The sub- watershed immediately downstream of the two upper subwatersheds is multi-family residen- tial and has different soil types. The subwatershed at the watershed outlet is primarily light commercial. If a design hydrograph were needed at the watershed outlet, it would be incor- rect to treat the watershed as a single watershed. To properly evaluate the design problem, it is necessary to determine the hydrologic runoff for each subarea and then combine them ap- propriately, including routing the runoff throughout the streams. Many of the elements dis- cussed in Section 9.10 are involved. The following elements are necessary to model this sim- ple case: For each of the four subwatersheds the rainfall excess distribution is computed using the SCS rainfall distribution for the region and the subarea curve number. Equation 7-42 is used to compute the rainfall excess. The SCS dimensionless unit hydrograph is dimensionalized using the peak discharge (Equation 9-71) and time to peak (t, = 213 t,) for each subwatershed. The rainfall excess is convolved with the unit hydrograph to obtain the direct runoff hydrograph for each subwatershed. The runoff hydrographs for the two subwatersheds are added together and then routed through the channel reach of watershed 3. The reach-routed hydrograph is then added to the runoff hydrograph of subwatershed 3 and routed through the channel reach of subwatershed 4. The reach routed hydrograph is then added to the runoff hydrograph of subwater- shed 4. Each operation is executed by entering the appropriate command and necessary input data. The process is quite simple once these commands are understood. 9.1 1.2 Summary of Input Requirements Even though the computer is used to solve problems, the input data requirements are surpris- ingly minimal, with the amount of data depending on the complexity of the problem to be solved. If actual rainfall events are not going to be used, the depth of precipitation is the only Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 meteorological input. For each subarea, the drainage area, runoff curve number, and time of concentration are required; the antecedent soil moisture condition (I, 11, or 111) must also be specified. For each channel reach, the length is required along with the channel cross-section description, which is the elevation, discharge, and end-area data; while optional, a routing coefficient may also be input. If the channel routing coefficient is not given as input, it will be computed using Equation 10-15 and the cross-section data. For each structure it is neces- sary to describe the outflow characteristics with the elevation-discharge-storage relationship. The time increment for all computations must be specified, and any baseflow in a channel reach must be specified. The discussion provided herein will be that for a generic application of the pro,o ram. This will use the column numbers originally assigned to the input. Since numerous versions of TR-20 are available in microsoftware form, the input structure will probably vary with the software package. Most of these packages permit free-field input that does not require use of specific columns. 9.11 .3 Basic Structure of Input Data Input requirements for a single program execution can be separated into three parts: tabula data, standard control, and executive control. The tabular data, which is input first, consists of the following: 1. The routing coefficient table, which is a tabular statement of Equation 10-15 2. The dimensionless hydrograph table, which is a tabular representation of the curvilin- ear unit hydrograph of Table 9-17 3. One or more cumulative rainfall tables, which provide the depth-time relationship of rainfall input 4. Stream cross-section data, which describes the elevation-discharge-end area relation- sh ip 5. Structure data, which defines the elevation-discharge-storage relationship. The tabular data serves as support data for the problem description. Following the tabular data, the user must specify the standard control, which consists of records that establish the sequence in which runoff hydrographs are determined, routed through reaches and/or structures, and combined at tributary junctions. That is, standard con- trol is used to describe the configuration of the watershed. Executive control follows the standard control. Executive control controls the compu- tational process. That is, it initiates the execution of the standard control sequence. The data arrangement is shown schematically in Figure 9-3 1. In addition to tabular data, standard control, and executive control, operations called \"modify standard control\" are available for solving problems. The modify standard control operations are used when more than one computational sequence is to be tested for a water- shed in a single execution. These operations will be discussed later. However, the modify standard control usually follows the executive control records for the previous problem exe- cution. Additionally, the modify standard control records are followed by another set of ex- Sec. 9.1 1 SCS Watershed Model: TR-20 EXECUTIVE CONTROL FOR WATERSHED - ENDOMP & ENDJOB I 1 MODIFY STANDARD CONTROL - E T CUMULATIVE RAINFALL TABLE FIGURE 9-31 Schematic diagram of TR-20 card sequence. ecutive control records that serve to initiate execution of the problem as described by the computational sequence as altered by the modified standard control. 9.1 1.4 Standard Control Operations Standard control includes six subroutine operations: 1. RUNOFF: an instruction to develop an inflow hydrograph 2. RESVOR: an instruction to route a hydrograph through a structure 3. REACH: an instruction to route a hydrograph through a channel reach 4. ADDHYD: an instruction to combine two hydrographs 5. SAVMOV: an instruction to move a hydrograph from one computer memory storage location to another 6. DIVERT: an instruction for a hydrograph to be separated into two parts Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 The operations are indicated on the computer records in columns 2,4-9, and 11. The number 6 is placed in column 2 to indicate standard control. The name of the subroutine operation is placed in columns 4-9. The operation number, which is shown preceding the operation name (that is, 1 for RUNOFF, 5 for SAVMOV), is placed in column 11. 9.1 1.5 Machine Storage Internal machine storage is used to store the hydrograph ordinates. Machine storage is indi- cated by a number from 1 to 7. Columns 19, 21, and 23 are used on standard control records to indicate machine storage locations. It is important to emphasize that only one hydrograph can occupy any one storage element at a time and that there must be a hydrograph in the stor- age element from which a subroutine references a storage location. The actual use of the ma- chine storage numbers (1 to 7) and the columns (19, 21, and 23) will be discussed separately for each subroutine operation. 9.1 1.6 Output Options Columns 61,63,65,67,69, and 71 of standard control records are used to specify the output. The individual output options are selected by placing a 1 in the appropriate column. If the column is left blank or a zero is inserted, the option will not be selected. The following list summarizes the output options: Output A \"I\" in Option Column Produces the Following Printout PEAK 61 Peak discharge and corresponding time of peak and elevation (maximum stage for a cross section and maximum storage elevation for a structure) HYD 63 Discharge hydrograph ordinates ELEV 65 Stage hydrograph ordinates (reach elevations for a cross section and water surface elevation for structures) VOL 67 Volume of water under the hydrograph in in.-depth, acre-ft, and ft3/sec- hours SUM 7 1 Requests the results of the subroutine be inverted in the summary tables at the end of the job 9.1 1.7 Content of Standard Control Records In addition to the reserved spaces discussed previously, three data fields are available for input on each standard control record. The input for each subroutine will be discussed sepa- rately. RUNOFF. The RUNOFF subroutine is intended to develop runoff hydrographs for subareas of a watershed. It uses Equation 7-42 in computing the rainfall excess for a given CN and the cumulative rainfall table.

The input for the RUNOFF subroutine is given in Table 9-19. RESVOR. The RESVOR subroutine uses the concepts presented in the section on reservoir routing (Chapter 11) to route a hydrograph through a structure. The structure num- ber is placed in columns 16 and 17 and the starting surface elevation in columns 25-36. The machine storage numbers of the inflow and outflow hydrographs are placed in columns 19 and 23, respectively. Table 9-20 shows the content of a RESVOR record.

Hydrograph Analysis and Synthesis Chap. 9 REACH. The REACH subroutine is used to route a hydrograph through a channel reach using the modified Att-IOn Method. The machine storage element that contains the up- stream hydrograph is inserted into column 19; the routed hydrograph is identified by the ma- chine storage element indicted in column 23. The length of the reach, in feet, is inserted in columns 25-36. The routing coefficient of Equation 10-15 can be inserted in columns 3748; if these columns are left blank, the routing coefficient will be computed using the cross-section data and the routing coefficient table, both of which are described in the section on tabular data. The number of routings, which is also optional, is placed in columns 49-60. The input for the REACH subroutine is given in Table 9-2 1. ADDHYD. The ADDHYD subroutine is used to add the two hydrographs that are lo- cated in the machine storage elements in columns 19 and 21; the resulting hydrograph is stored in the machine storage element indicated in column 23. The cross-section num- ber where the two hydrographs are added is indicated in columns 13-15. The input for an ADDHYD record is outlined in Table 9-22. SAVMOV. The SAVMOV subroutine is used to move a hydrograph from one ma- chine storage element to another: the respective machine storage elements are indicated in columns 19 and 23. The cross section or structure number is indicated in columns 13-17. Table 9-23 summarizes the input requirements for the SAVMOV subroutine. DIVERT. The DIVERT subroutine is used to separate an upstream hydrograph into hydrographs. The record input is given in Table 9-24. Note that for option 2, columns 25-36 will be left blank.

For example, a small watershed in a steeply sloped region may require a hydrograph method, while a watershed of the same size in a coastal area with low slopes and sandy soils may be adequately represented by a peak discharge equation.

Table 9-3 1 shows the routing coefficient table for an increment of 0.2 ftlsec. 9.11 . I0 The Dimensionless Hydrograph Table The dimensionless hydrograph table gives the ordinates of the curvilinear unit hydrograph for a constant time increment. Both the discharge and time axes are dimensionless. The dis- charge axis is given as a ratio of the discharge to the peak discharge; therefore, the peak ordi- nate equals 1. The time axis is given as a ratio of the time to the length of the time base; this differs from the previous discussion in that the time axis had been given as a ratio of time to the time to peak. Because the time to peak is one-fifth the time base, the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph occurs at dimensionless time of 0.2. Table 9-32 summarizes the input required for the dimensionless hydrograph table. The tabular data are preceded by a DIMHYD record and followed by a ENDTBL record. The di- mensionless time increment must be specified in columns 25-36 of the DIMHYD record and followed by a ENDTBL record. The tabular data are given in constant increments of dimen- sionless time, with the first ordinate for a time of 0. Table 9-33 gives an example of the di- mensionless hydrograph table.

These names reflect their intended use. The three types may be easier understood if they are classified on the basis of the scale used for the precipitation and time axes. Table 9-34 summarizes the scales of the rainfall tables and indicates the input that is required to reference the tables. It is especially important to emphasize that each table must be expressed in cumulative form. The one-day watershed evaluation storm. Table 9-34 indicates that the pre- cipitation scale for this cumulative rainfall table is dimensionless and the time scale ranges from 0 to 24 hr. This table is, therefore, of use when the standard type I, Ia, 11, or I11 is used. It is assigned a table number of I, whch is indicated in column 11 of the RAINFL record. Since the precipitation scale is dimensionless, an actual rainfall volume in inches must be specified on the COMPUT record. Because an actual time scale is used, a duration of 1. O is specified on the COMPUT record. The actual rainfall volume and the duration of 1.0 serve as multipliers to convert the rainfall table to a dimensional form. This rainfall table is suit- able for the evaluation of watersheds in which the travel time through the watershed is ap- proximately 2 days or less.

The data table summarizes the water surface elevation-discharge-cross-sectional end-area relationship. It consists of a series of cross- section data records that are preceded by an XSECTN record and followed by an ENDTBL record. There can not be more than 20 cross-section data records for any one cross section. Values between the points that are used to define the cross section are estimated using straight-line interpolation. For extrapolation beyond the highest elevation, a straight-line ex- tension is made using the last two values of data shown. If the discharge is given in ft3/sec/mi' (CSM), the total drainage area above the cross section must be shown on the XSECTN record. The computer multiplies the value shown in ths field by the discharge in ft3/sec/mi2i n order to convert to ft3/sec. If the discharge is given in ft3/sec, a value of 1.0 must be inserted for the drainage area on the XSECTN record (Table 9 41 ). Table 9-42 shows the records that comprise the cross-section data table. The drainage area above cross section 001 is 5.4 mi2, as indicated on the XSECTN record. Because a drainage area is given on the XSECTN record, the discharge values on the cross-section data records are given in ft3/sec/mi2. 9.1 1.13 Structure Data Table A structure data table is required for each structure number identified in columns 16 and 17 of the standard control. The table summarizes the water surface elevation-discharge- reservoir storage relationship. It consists of a series of elevation-discharge-storage records preceded by a STRUCT record and followed by an ENDTBL record. The number of coordi- nates that are used to describe a structure cannot exceed 20 elevations. The 0 discharge on the first record must be oriented to the crest elevation of the low-stage outlet in the principal spillway (the elevation on the RESVOR record of standard control at time 0).

There are three types of rainfall tables available: the 1-day watershed evaluation storm, emergency spillway or freeboard hydrograph, and actual storm. Each table has specific scales for precipitation and time axes, which are used to convert the rainfall table to a dimensional form. For instance, the one-day watershed evaluation storm table has a dimensionless precipitation scale and an actual time scale, making it suitable for evaluating watersheds with a travel time of approximately 2 days or less."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to specify the drainage area above the cross section on the XSECTN record in the stream cross-section data table?", "answer": "Specifying the drainage area above the cross section on the XSECTN record is essential because it allows the computer to convert the discharge from cubic feet per square mile (CSM) to cubic feet per second (ft3/sec). If the discharge is given in ft3/sec, a value of 1.0 must be inserted for the drainage area.

The dimensionless time increment must be specified in columns 25-36 of the DIMHYD record, and the tabular data are given in constant increments of dimensionless time, with the first ordinate for a time of 0.

Executive control consists of three subroutine operations: the INCREM record, the COMPUT record, and the ENDCMP record. The executive control records are placed after the tabular data and the standard control. INCREM record. The sole purpose of the INCREM record is to specify the main time increment in hours (columns 25-36). All hydrographs generated by the program will be determined at this time increment. It is important that the main time increment be made short enough to describe adequately the hydrographs for smaller subwatersheds and large enough that when multiplied by the number of coordinates, it will extend through the peak period.

I6 Modify Standard Control The modify standard control subroutines are used to insert new routines into the standard control sequence, to alter the input data for existing operations, and to delete any operations in the sequence. Many hydrologic analyses are intended to examine various alternatives, such as changes in land use or the insertion of a control structure into the watershed system.

A separate executive control sequence is placed after each modify standard control sequence. There are six modify standard control subroutine operations: 1. INSERT: an operation used to insert new standard control subroutines into the stan- dard control sequence 2. ALTER: an operation that is used to change any input on a standard control record image, including machine storage numbers, data field input, and output options 3.

LIST: an operation that causes the tabular and standard control data to be printed out 5.

BASFLO: an operation that allows a uniform rate of baseflow (ft3/sec) to be introduced into reach routings at any location The INSERT record. TR-20 is quite frequently used to evaluate the effect of struc- tures in a developing watershed. This use represents an example where an INSERT record would be of value. A standard sequence of tabular data, standard control, and executive con- trol would be used to analyze the watershed without the structure. Then the modify standard control and necessary executive control records could be used to analyze the watershed with the structure. The contents of an INSERT record is summarized in Table 9-5 1. The INSERT record is followed by one or more standard control records. These records are inserted into the stan- dard control sequence immediately following the first reference to a cross-section number or a structure that has the same value as that located in columns 13-15 or 16 and 17, respec- tively, of that value on the INSERT record.

These records will replace the records in the standard control se- quence that are identical to the values in columns 1-18. The input for the ALTER record is shown in Table 9-52. The DELETE record. The DELETE record is used to eliminate records from the standard control sequence. The DELETE record is followed by one or more standard control records; the records in the standard control sequence that are identical in columns 1-1 8 to these records are eliminated. Table 9-53 provides a summary of the contents of the DELETE record. The BASFLO record. The BASFLO record is used to add a constant baseflow (ft3/sec) to each hydrograph. If a second BASFLO record is inserted, the difference between the old baseflow and the new baseflow is added to the inflow hydrograph when the next REACH subroutine is referenced. Table 9-54 summarizes the input for the BASFLO record.

Problems 57 1 9.1 1. I7 Execution Sequence In general, a TR-20 program will be structured with the tabular data first, followed by the standard control and executive control operations. If additional analyses are to be executed using modify standard control operations, the modifications follow the ENDCMP record. An executive control sequence will then follow the modify standard control operations. When additional sequences of modify standard control-executive control are not included, the pro- gram run is terminated with an ENDJOB record. PROBLEMS 9-1.

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to malung technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project.

A professional engineer submits a proposal to a local governmental agency in response to an open request for highway drainage work. The proposal cames a price of $40,000 for the completed work. The local government official in charge of awarding the contract meets with the professional engineer after receiving the engineer's proposal. The of- ficial indicates that the contract will be awarded to the engineer's company if the engineer will revise the cost figure in the proposal to $48,000 and then make $8,000 in payments for unspecified work to a company that is essentially the public official.

In terms of the hydrologic cycle, the channel processes for such drainage areas are unimportant with respect to design. As the size of the drainage area in- creases or when a design is required at a location with a large contributing area upstream of the design location, channel processes must be considered to maintain a reasonable level of design accuracy. As the lengths of the stream channels and the size of the contributing areas increase, the storage in the stream channels usually increases and the channel processes be- come more important. In these cases, designs require accounting for the effects of channel storage.

For small watersheds, channel processes are often negligible, simplifying the design process. However, as the drainage area increases, channel processes become more critical, requiring more complex designs that account for channel storage and its effects on the runoff hydrograph. This shift from negligible to significant channel processes poses a challenge, as it demands a deeper understanding of hydrologic principles and the application of channel routing methods to ensure design accuracy and reliability."}, {"question": "In the context of flood control, how does the consideration of channel storage impact design decisions?", "answer": "The consideration of channel storage significantly impacts design decisions for flood control by influencing the predicted runoff hydrograph and the capacity of the channel to handle flood runoff. Accurate accounting for channel storage through channel routing methods allows designers to better estimate the peak flow rates and the timing of flood events, which are critical for the design of flood control structures such as dams, levees, and spillways.

{"paragraph": "10.1.1 Analysis Versus Synthesis Channel routing can be introduced using the systems-theory model (see Figure 10-1). The input and output functions consist of the runoff hydrographs at the upstream and downstream sections of a channel, respectively; the transfer function is the channel routing procedure that is used to translate and attenuate the upstream runoff hydrograph into a downstream hydro- graph. The transfer function actually consists of two parts, the routing method and the physi- cal characteristics of the stream reach. In practice, we usually assume that the channel char- acteristics are known, so the routing method becomes the transfer function. The systems-theory representation of channel routing can also be used to distinguish between the concepts of analysis and design. In the case of analysis, the hydrographs at the upstream and downstream sections of the channel reach are known and the coefficients of the transfer function (that is, routing method or channel characteristics) are evaluated. In the de- sign or synthesis case, both the hydrograph at the upstream section and the transfer function are known, and the flood hydrograph at the downstream section must be computed.

Ideally, we would like to assume that channel properties could be assessed directly, which would mean that the problem of analysis would only involve fitting the coefficients of the routing method. However, while channel characteristics such as the length can be measured with a reasonable level of accuracy, the estimates of variables such as Manning's roughness coeffi- cient are only approximations. Therefore, it may be necessary to check the value of channel parameters for which accurate estimates may not be possible. For a given upstream hydrograph and channel system, a number of routing methods are available to route the hydrograph through the stream reach. Without passing judgment on the methods, a number of routing methods will be introduced and compared on the basis of their underlying assumptions.

Sec. 10.2 Development of the Routing Equation 587 two times t, and t,, which are separated by the incremental time At = t, - t,. Expressing Equation 10-1 in terms of the average inflow and average outflow at times t, and t, gives Equation 10-2 is the numerical form of the routing equation. Assuming that the inflow hy- drograph is known for all t and that the initial outflow and storage, 0,a nd S,, are known at t,, then Equation 10-2 contains two unknowns, 0, and S ., Thus, to use the routing equation, a second relationship is needed. For steady, uniform channel flow, the inflow, outflow, and storage are a function of the depth of flow, h. If we assume that the stage-discharge relationship (that is, the rating curve) is a straight line on log-log paper, the discharges I and 0 can be represented by the following: I = ahd (10-3a) and 0 = ahd Equations 10-3 have the same coefficients a and d, which implies that the properties of the stream reach are relatively constant. The storage characteristics at the upstream and down- stream sections are also assumed constant, with storage and depth also assumed to be related through a log-log relationship: S, = bh\" (1 04a) and So = bh\" in which b and m are the constants that define the log-log relationship between storage and depth. Solving Equations 10-3a and 10-3b for h and substituting these into Equations l W a and 10-4b, respectively, yields and If we assume that the weighted-average storage S is a weighted function of the storage at the upstream and downstream cross sections, we get + S = xs, (1 - x) So ( 1 0 4 + = x ~ l r n l ~( 1 - x) ~ 0 \" ~ ~ ( 10-6b) in which x is a coefficient that reflects the importance of storage at the two cross sections. For uniform flow in a prismatic channel, it can be shown that d = 5/3 and m = 1; thus the storage function is Channel Routing Chap. 10 The value of x depends on the characteristics of the channel reach. For natural streams, x is often in the range from 0.4 to 0.5. For a reservoir, x is usually assumed to equal zero since storage then only depends on the outflow. For a stream where storage is more dependent on outflow, such as in a low-sloped channel with wide floodplains, the value of x would be smaller than the typical range from 0.4 to 0.5. The use of the routing equation to derive a storage-discharge curve can be illustrated using a rectangular channel of width w. For a depth h, the cross-sectional area equals wh and + the wetted perimeter equals (w 2h). For the case where w is much greater than 2h, the hy- draulic radius is approximately equal to the depth of flow. Using Manning's Equation to compute the velocity of flow, the continuity equation gives Comparing Equation 10-8 with Equations 10-3 implies that d = 513 and a = 1.49w~~\"~n-'. Thus I or 0 in Equations 10-3 are a function of the 513 power of the flow depth. If we assume that the change in depth over the channel reach of length L is not suffi- ciently large and that the reach length is less than the wavelength of the unsteady flow flood wave, the storage in the reach can be represented by the volume of a parallelepiped of length L, width w, and mean depth h: S = Lwh ( 10-9a) Comparing Equation 10-9a to Equation 10-4 implies that m = 1 and b = Lw. Based on these values of a and b, the value of K in Equations 10-5 can be computed by solving Equation 10-8 for h and substituting it into Equation 10-9a: Comparing Equation 10-9b with Equation 10-5 yields In addition to the stage-discharge relationship of Equation 10-3 and stage-storage relation- ship of Equation 10-4, the area-discharge relationship is used in channel routing: in which A is the cross-sectional area, and f and p are constants.

The value of x can vary depending on the characteristics of the channel reach, with typical ranges from 0.4 to 0.5 for natural streams, and x = 0 for reservoirs where storage depends only on outflow. The choice of x affects the routing process by influencing how storage is calculated and thus impacts the prediction of outflow and the overall behavior of the system."}, {"question": "What implications does the assumption of a log-log relationship between storage and depth have on the routing equation?", "answer": "The assumption of a log-log relationship between storage and depth, as expressed by equations such as S = bh^m, has significant implications for the routing equation. This assumption simplifies the analysis by providing a power-law relationship that can be easily integrated into the routing equation, facilitating the solution for outflow and storage.

Therefore, careful consideration of the channel's characteristics and flow regime is necessary when applying this assumption."}, {"question": "How does the hydraulic radius affect the computation of velocity in Manning's Equation, and what are the implications for channel routing?", "answer": "In Manning's Equation, the hydraulic radius is a critical parameter that affects the computation of velocity. For cases where the width of the channel is much greater than twice the depth of flow, the hydraulic radius can be approximated as equal to the depth of flow. This simplification facilitates the computation of velocity and subsequently influences the routing equation by affecting the calculation of discharge and storage. The accuracy of the hydraulic radius approximation can have significant implications for the overall accuracy of the routing process, especially in channels with complex geometries or varying flow conditions."}, {"question": "Why is the area-discharge relationship used in channel routing, and what form does it typically take?", "answer": "The area-discharge relationship is used in channel routing to provide an additional characterization of the flow in the channel, complementing the stage-discharge and stage-storage relationships. This relationship typically takes the form of A = fQ^p, where A is the cross-sectional area, and f and p are constants. The area-discharge relationship is useful for understanding how the cross-sectional area of the flow changes with discharge, which can be important in channels with significant variations in geometry or where the flow regime changes over time."}, {"question": "In the context of a rectangular channel, how is the storage represented, and what are the implications for the routing equation?", "answer": "In a rectangular channel, the storage can be represented by the volume of a parallelepiped of length L, width w, and mean depth h, given by S = Lwh. This representation simplifies the calculation of storage and its relationship with depth and discharge, facilitating the solution of the routing equation.

Whereas the Convex Routing Method provides only at- tenuation, the modified Att-an Method provides for both attenuation and translation. To apply the modified Att-Kin Method, the' values of m and x in Equation 10-24 are evaluated using either cross-section data or a rating table developed from measured runoff events. The value of K is then computed from Equation 10-22 and used to compute C,, with Equation 10-21. The routing equation (Equation 10-21b) can then be used to route the upstream hy- drograph. After deriving the first estimate of the downstream hydrograph, it is necessary to check whether or not hydrograph translation is necessary. The hydrograph computed with Equation 10-21b is translated when the lunematic travel time (At,) is greater than Atps where Atps is the difference in the times to peak between the upstream hydrograph I and the hydro- graph computed with Equation 10-21 : t,, in which and tpi are the times to peak of the downstream (outflow) and upstream (inflow) hydrographs, respectively.

This procedure can be summarized by the following steps: 1. From cross-section information, evaluate the rating table coefficients m and x. 2. Compute K and then C,,.

Compute the kinematic travel time At, (Equation 10-3 1). 6. If At, > Atps, translate the computed downstream hydrograph (see Figure 10-5). Example 10-4 To apply the modified Att-Kin Method. the upstream hydrograph for an appropriate time incre- ment At must be known; additionally, channel characteristics must be known, including the reach length and rating curve information. For this example, the upstream hydrograph for At = 0.25 hr is given in Table 10-4. Assume that the rating curve coefficients are x = 0.1 and nz = 1.6. The problem will be to compute the downstream hydrograph for a reach length (L) of 10.000 ft. Using Equation 10-33, k is and the cross-sectional area at the maximum discharge computed from Equation 10-24 is From the continuity equation, Equation 10-23, the velocity is From Equation 10-22 the routing coefficient K is Channel Routing Chap. 10 TABLE 10-4 Example 10-4: Modified Att-Kin Method: Synthesis of Downstream Hydrographs 0, for L = 10,000 ft and 0, for L = 20,000 ft and the routing coefficient from Equation 10-21 is c\", 2At 2 (0.25) = -- = 0.456 2K t At 2 (0.423) t 0.25 Therefore, the routing equation (Equation 10-21b) is Using the routing equation, the downstream hydrograph is given in Table 10-4 and shown in Figure 10-6.

Since At,, > At,, translation is not required. If instead of a reach length of 10,000 ft, the upstream hydrograph is routed through a reach of 20,000 ft, the following calculations provide the routing equation: Using Equation 1047, the downstream storage-routed hydrograph is given in Table 1 0 4 a nd shown in Figure 10-6. The peak of the downstream hydrograph occurs at 2.75 hr; therefore, from Equation 10-30, At, is 0.75 hr. Using Equation 10-32, Sp0 equals 8.3234 x lo6 and from Equation 10-3 1, At, is Channel Routing Chap. 10 Therefore, since At < At, the storage-routed hydrograph must be translated by 0.886 - 0.75 = P\" 0.136 hr. The resulting hydrograph is shown in Figure 10-6. Example 10-5 In the problem of analysis, the following information is known: the measured upstream and downstream hydrographs, the appropriate routing increment, and some physical characteristics such as the reach length. The unknowns center on the routing coefficient and the translation time difference (At, - At,,). While these two unknowns are sufficient for defining the routing proce- dure, it may also be of interest to know values for other unknowns, such as the rating curve para- meters x and rn, as well as the hnematic time parameter K. These unknowns can be estimated after values for the primary unknowns have been estimated. In the analysis of the Convex Method, it was only necessary to estimate the routing coef- ficient C. The same statistical procedure could be used for the modified Att-Kin Method, except that the time difference (At, - At,,) must also be estimated. While an effort-intensive numerical method could be used, it may be sufficient to estimate the time difference, back-translate the hy- drograph in time, and then use the same statistical procedure that was outlined for the Convex Method. Where it is difficult to estimate the time difference, several trial estimates may be made and selection based on the best overall fit. The approximate fitting method will be illustrated using the data of Table 10-5. The mea- sured upstream (1) and downstream (0)h ydrographs are given in Table 10-5 for a 0.1-hr time in- crement; the hydrographs are also shown in Figure 10-7. There appears to be a time translation of 0.1 hr at the start of the downstream hydrograph, so a value of 0.1 hr is used for the time dif- ference (At, - At,,). The downstream hydrograph is back-translated by 0.1 hr and is indicated by 0' in Table 10-5. The two hydrographs I and Of are then subjected to the statistical analysis of Equation 10-17. The calculations are shown in Table 10-5.

{"paragraph": "10.5.1 Estimation of the Muskingum Routing Coefficients Again, a distinction must be made between the two cases of analysis and synthesis. In the case of analysis, measured hydrographs are available for both the upstream and downstream cross sections, and the objective is to analyze the data to find the best estimates of x and K. In the synthesis case, the values of x and K can be computed using site characteristics and known relationships between the site characteristics and x and K. The objective is to compute the hydrograph at the downstream cross section for a given hydrograph at the upstream cross section. This discussion, so far, has assumed that a single site is of interest; that is, the values of x and K estimated from the analysis of hydrographs are to be used for synthesizing flood hydrographs for that same stream reach. A second type of estimation problem exists. Where measured hydrographs are not available (the site is ungaged), estimated values of x and K must be obtained from other sites. In this \"ungaged problem, analysis would refer to the process of developing prediction equations relating physical site characteristics (that is, Manning's n, channel slope, hydraulic radius) to many sets of values of x and K obtained from analysis of measured hydrograph data. Synthesis would refer to the use of the prediction equations with physical site charac- teristics to estimate the values of x and K. In this \"ungaged case, no hydrographs exist on the stream reach of interest. The accuracy of the estimated values of x and K will depend on the similarity between the ungaged stream reach and the characteristics of the stream reaches used in developing the prediction equations. While the Muskingum Method has been widely used for decades, values of the coeffi- cients K and x are not available from the analysis of measured hydrographs. A general rule of thumb is that K can be estimated by the travel time through the reach and a value of 0.2 can be used for x. A value of 0.5 for x is usually considered to be the upper limit of rationality; this value suggests equal weighting of inflow I and outflow 0, and it appears primarily as translation of the hydrograph with little attenuation (see Figure 10-8). If x = 0.5 and At << K, then Co = -1, C, = 1, and C, = 1. If At is small, then I, is approximately equal to I,, which means that they will cancel and the hydrograph will be translated by one time increment. A value of 0 for x is the practical lower limit and suggests that the inflow has little effect; this would reflect reservoir-storage type effects in which attenuation would be dominant. Some have reported values for x in the range from 0.4 to 0.5 for natural streams, while others sug- gest values from 0.1 to 0.3 for natural streams, with x = 0.2 commonly assumed. The value of x would probably be smaller for stream reaches with relatively wide flood plains. Unfortu- nately, these guidelines are imprecise and somewhat conflicting.

{"paragraph": "10.5.2 Analysis of the Muskingum Coefficients The problem of estimating values for the routing coefficients can be solved where measured hydrographs are available. Values of K and x can be estimated with the measured data using either a graphical or statistical approach. Given the greater effort required by the graphical solution and the greater precision with the statistical approach, the statistical approach is far superior to the graphical approach. This is more true now that simple regression algorithms are available on hand-held calculators. The graphical and statistical approaches that are pre- sented here are based on the same formulation. The graphical approach uses Equations 10-2 and 10-5 1, with the following procedure used to obtain estimates of K and x: 1. For each point in time, compute the storage S,, by rearranging Equation 10-2: Note that S, is usually assumed to be 0 for the initial condition. 2. Using a trial value of x, compute [XI i- (1 - x)O] for each point in time. 3. Plot the computed storage S from Step 1 as the ordinate versus [XI i- (1 - x)O] from Step 2 as the abscissa for each point in time. Sec. 10.5 Muskingum Method 605 4. Revise the value of x and repeat Steps 1 to 3 until the plot shows a minimum amount of deviation from a straight line. 5. Use the slope of the line as the best estimate of K and the value of x that produced the minimum deviation from the line in Step 4 as the estimate of x. The graphical approach is somewhat subjective in that for a given set of data, exactly equal estimates will not be obtained when two or more people independently analyze the set. Estimates of x and K can be obtained using least squares regression. Equation 10-53 can be inserted into Equation 2-52 using 0, as the value of y. Differentiating F with respect to the coefficients Co, C,, and C2 yields the following three simultaneous equations: where each of the summations is over all elements of the upstream and downstream hydro- graphs.

{"paragraph": "10.5.3 Synthesis of the Muskingum Coefficients It should be evident that the complexity of hydrologic processes is such that the analysis of hydrographs for different storm events will produce different estimates of the routing coeffi- cients. Therefore, one should expect that the analysis of hydrographs for a number of differ- ent storm events on the same watershed will improve the accuracy of future estimates of routing. Where more than one set of flood hydrographs are available, values of K and x can be computed for each pair of upstream and downstream hydrographs; the vectors of values of K and x can then be used to derive \"best\" estimates, such as mean values. The values of x and K can also be estimated using Manning's Equation. The value of x can be taken from Equation 10-26b, while K is set equal to bla, where the evaluation of b and a was discussed with respect to Equation 10-7. Channel Routing Chap. 10 The selection of the routing parameters is important to ensure rationality. Improper se- lection can result in negative ordinates of the computed downstream hydrograph. Hjelmfelt (1985), as well as others, has pointed out that negative flows can be avoided if K and x are chosen such that 0.5At x s - 1 - x and x G 0.5 K One rule of thumb used in practice is that the ratio AtlK should be approximately 1 and x should be in the range 0 to 0.5. When this is applied, the restriction of Equation 1&61 will be met. Negative ordinates may also be the result of the use of a reach length that is too long. In such cases, it may be preferable to separate the channel into two reaches and route through two reaches using the outflow from reach 1 as the inflow to reach 2. Explicit methods for selecting values of the coefficients are not readily available for lo- cations where estimates are not made from the analysis of measured hydrographs. In most cases, empirical guidelines are used. The parameter K can be approximated by the travel time through the reach. Rules for estimating x are less readily available. As indicated previously, standard practice is to assume a value of 0.2 for x, with a smaller value for channel systems with large floodplains and larger values, near 0.4, for natural channels. Dooge et al. (1982) provided the following relationships for estimating K and x: and in which L is the reach length, Voi s the average velocity, yo is the full flow depth, So is the slope of the channel bottom, and F is the Froude Number. Example 10-6 The hydrograph data of Table 10-2 can also be used to demonstrate the analysis of data for esti- mating the Muskingum coefficients. Values for K and x are first estimated using the graphical method. The computed storages (Equation 10-56) and the values of [XI+( 1 - x)O] for values of x of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 are given in Table 10-6. Plots of storage S versus [xl+ (1 - x)O] for the three cases are shown in Figure 10-9. It is evident that there is little deviation from the line for x equal to 0.2; however, loops are apparent for x equal to both 0.3 and 0.4. Therefore, a value of 0.2 can be used for x. An estimate of the coefficient K is obtained from the slope of the line; using the largest storage value and the origin, the estimate of K is For K = 3389, x = 0.2, and At = 1200, the routing coefficients from Equations 10-54 are C, = -0.023, C, = 0.386, and C, = 0.637; therefore, the routing equation is 0, = - 0.023 I, + 0.386 I, + 0.637 0, (10-65) The accuracy of Equation 10-65 could be assessed by regenerating the downstream hydrograph and comparing the measured and predicted hydrographs. Sec. 10.5 Muskingum Method 607 TABLE 10-6 Graphical and Statistical Evaluation of Muskingum Coefficient for Example 10-6 The data were also analyzed using regression analysis. The data of Table 10-6 yields the following simultaneous equations: Using Equation 10-60 yields K = 3410 and x = 0.199, which are close to the values that resulted from the graphical analysis. Using Equation 10-54, the routing coefficients are Co = -0.024, C, = 0.384, and C2 = 0.640; thus the routing equation is Equation 10-66 was used with the upstream hydrograph to predict the downstream hydrograph; the resulting ordinates Q are given in Table 10-6. The largest error is 3 ft3/sec, and the computed hydrograph shows good agreement with the measured hydrograph. Applying Equation 10-61, the value of O.SAt/K equals 0.179; this value is less than the value of x, so negative ordinates occur. In this case, the second ordinate equaled -0.2, with the remaining ordinates being positive. Thus the effect was not significant.

Consider- ing only the routing portion of the modified Att-I(ln Method, both the MAK and the Convex Methods are based on the linear storage function of Equation 10-1 1; the Muslungum Method assumes the more general storage function of Equation 10-5 1. If x = 0, Equations 10-1 1 and 10-5 1 are identical. Given that values of x for natural channels are often in the range 0.1 to 0.3, the assumption that x = 0 may not be a realistic assumption. The translation correction of the modified Att-lGn Method may partially compensate for the assumption that x = 0. Sec. 10.6 Comparison of Routing Methods 609 In applying the Convex and MAK Methods, the same routing coefficient (either C or C,) is used to weight the inflow hydrograph ordinates. This can be shown by expressing Equation 10-1 2 in terms of I, and I, rather than I,: Whereas the Convex and MAK Methods apply weightings of C and 0 to I, and I,, the Musk- ingum Method uses different weights; specifically, Co and C, of Equations 10-54a and 10-54b are applied to I, and I,, respectively. The use of different weights for I, and I, pro- vides somewhat greater flexibility in fitting the Muskingum Routing Method with measured storm hydrographs, at least in comparison to the routing equations of Equations 10-14 and 10-2 1b . The weights applied to the downstream hydrograph ordinate 0, can also be compared. For the Convex and MAK Methods, using Equation 10-21a gives The form of Equation 10-68 is similar to the form of Equation 10-54c; the two weights are equal when x = 0, and the two weights will be nearly equal when Kx is small compared with (K - 0.5At), whlch is when x is near 0. In terms of analysis, the Muskingum Method requires fitting values for the two coeffi- cients x and K. The Convex and MAK Methods only require fitting the parameter C or C,, respectively. Given the ease with which parameters can be fit by computer, the analysis of two parameters is just as easy as fitting the single routing coefficient. However, it is recog- nized that when fitting multicoefficient models in which the coefficients are not independent, the less sensitive coefficients may not approach their true value.

To avoid this, K and x should be chosen such that 0.5At x ≤ 1 - x and x ≥ 0.5 K. One rule of thumb is to ensure the ratio At/K is approximately 1 and x is between 0 to 0.5. If not, it may be necessary to separate the channel into two reaches and route through two reaches using the outflow from reach 1 as the inflow to reach 2, highlighting the importance of careful coefficient selection."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating Muskingum coefficients, what is the role of Manning's Equation, and how does it relate to the values of x and K?", "answer": "Manning's Equation can be used to estimate the values of x and K.

This method provides an alternative approach to estimating the coefficients, especially when multiple sets of flood hydrographs are not available."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to select the routing parameters in the Muskingum Method, and what are the consequences of improper selection?", "answer": "Selecting the routing parameters in the Muskingum Method is challenging because improper selection can result in negative ordinates of the computed downstream hydrograph. This can occur if the reach length is too long or if the coefficients K and x are not chosen appropriately. To mitigate this, guidelines such as ensuring the ratio At/K is approximately 1 and x is between 0 to 0.5 can be followed. However, the lack of explicit methods for selecting these coefficients, especially for locations without measured hydrographs, adds to the complexity."}, {"question": "How do the Convex, modified Att-Kin, and Muskingum routing methods compare in terms of their underlying assumptions and numerical approximations?", "answer": "The Convex, modified Att-Kin, and Muskingum routing methods are based on the same numerical approximation of the continuity equation but differ in their underlying assumptions. The Muskingum Method assumes a more general storage function, whereas the Convex and modified Att-Kin Methods are based on a linear storage function.

Other more theoreti- cally detailed routing methods exist. Assuming an open channel where lateral inflow can be ignored, the continuity equation for gradually varied, unsteady flow is Sec. 10.8 Kinematic Flood Routing 613 in which A is the cross-sectional area of flow, Q is the discharge, and t and x are the time and the distance along the channel, respectively; both A and Q are a function of t and x.

The first term (aVldt) is important for unsteady, nonuniform flow. The second term (dVlax) is important for steady nonuniform flow, and the third term (ahlax) is significant for steady uniform flow.

This simplification allows for the use of kinematic wave theory, which models the flow based on the balance between gravitational and shear forces, leading to a proportional relationship between discharge and depth of flow.

{"paragraph": "10.8.1 Kinematic Wave Routing of Sheet Flow Sheet flow can be described by the continuity equation for two-dimensional flow: in which q is the discharge per unit width, i,' is the excess inflow rate in flow rate per unit area, y is the flow depth at any point at distance x from the top of the sloping surface, and t is time. Two conditions are important to the solution. First, before equilibrium occurs, dqldx = 0, which yields the following constraint: y = i; t,. This implies that the flow velocity equals the excess inflow rate i,* which introduces increasingly greater error in the solution as the wave moves down the surface. The second condition is that dyldt = 0 at equilibrium. At the time of peak, this condition should be realistic at the end of the slope. The solution also uses the conservation of mass: total inflow equals the sum of the total outflow and the water stored on the surface, which in the literature is referred to as detention storage. At the time of equilibrium (t,), the total outflow equals i,' L t,. The outflow is as- sumed to be a proportion p of the inflow. The detention storage (D,)a t equilibrium is as- sumed to equal the volume of water still on the surface. Thus, the conservation of mass is Solving Equation 10-87 for the equilibrium time yields The depth-discharge relationship is assumed as q = ayb A linear depth-time relationship for rainfall excess is assumed, which at equilibrium requires ',i = yjt,. The resulting outflow hydrograph has no attenuation and leads to the conclusion that the constant p is only a function of the coefficient b of Equation 10-89. Consequently, the detention storage is given by which can be substituted into Equation 10-88 to compute the equilibrium time. Using Man- ning's Equation to define the coefficients of the depth-discharge relationship of Equation 10-89 and adjusting for the units of the variables yields Sec. 10.9 Muskingum-Cunge Method 61 5 Equation 10-91 is intended to give the detention storage at equilibrium. The use of Equation 10-91 carries with it the assumption that there is no attenuation at the end of the slope, al- though this does not agree with the empirical evidence of Izzard (1946) and others. Crawford and Linsley (1966) indicated that Equation 10-91 provided good estimates of detention only for smooth surfaces. However, Crawford and Linsley (1966) also indicated that the ratio of detention storage for turbulent flow to laminar flow (D,,lD,,) on a paved surface equals 1 for iL of 260, which is below Izzard's limit of 500. Even for iL equal to 2000, they indicated that the ratio D,JD,, is less than 1.75. Thus, detention is not overly sensitive to changes in iL, and the concepts may still provide reasonable approximations for turbulent flow. Chow (1964) stated that applications of these concepts indicated that Equation 10-91 was satisfactory for turbulent flow, which supports the findings of Crawford and Linsley. As an alternative to Equation 10-91, Izzard (1946) developed the following relation- ship for detention storage: in which C is a coefficient that varies with the roughness of the surface. Use of Equation 10-92 produces attenuation of the sheet-flow runoff hydrograph. Izzard indicated that Equa- tion 10-92 is accurate where the product iL is less than about 500. An algorithm can be formulated based on the above equations. Izzard's empirical equation (Equation 10-92) for detention is used in place of the theoretical model of Equation 10-91. The time of concentration can be used as the equilibrium time. Sheet-flow discharge rates can be determined from the following (Viessman et al., 1996): in which D is the average detention during the routing interval. The continuity of mass can use :i as the inflow, q as the outflow, and storage defined by Equation 10-92.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of sheet flow routing, what is the continuity equation for two-dimensional flow, and what are its key components?", "answer": "The continuity equation for two-dimensional flow in sheet flow routing is given by the equation involving discharge per unit width (q), excess inflow rate per unit area (i'), flow depth (y), and time (t). Key components include the discharge per unit width, excess inflow rate, flow depth, and time, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of sheet flow."}, {"question": "How does the flow velocity relate to the excess inflow rate before equilibrium occurs in sheet flow, and what implications does this have for the solution?", "answer": "Before equilibrium occurs, the flow velocity equals the excess inflow rate (i'), which introduces increasingly greater error in the solution as the wave moves down the surface. This relationship implies that the assumption of flow velocity being equal to the excess inflow rate may not hold true as the flow progresses, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the solution. The error increases as the wave moves down the surface, suggesting that this assumption may be more reliable for shorter distances or earlier times in the flow process."}, {"question": "In the context of kinematic wave routing, why is the condition dy/dt = 0 at equilibrium important, and what does it signify?", "answer": "The condition dy/dt = 0 at equilibrium is important because it signifies that the flow depth no longer changes with time at the point of equilibrium. This condition is crucial for determining the equilibrium time and for applying the conservation of mass principle, which states that total inflow equals the sum of total outflow and water stored on the surface. At equilibrium, the total outflow equals the excess inflow rate times the equilibrium time, providing a basis for calculating detention storage and understanding the behavior of sheet flow."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between detention storage and the volume of water on the surface at equilibrium, and how is this related to the conservation of mass?", "answer": "At equilibrium, the detention storage (D) is assumed to equal the volume of water still on the surface. This relationship is derived from the conservation of mass principle, which states that total inflow equals the sum of total outflow and water stored on the surface. The detention storage at equilibrium can be calculated using the equation D = i' * L * t, where i' is the excess inflow rate, L is the length of the surface, and t is the equilibrium time. This equation highlights the direct relationship between detention storage, excess inflow rate, surface length, and equilibrium time, underscoring the importance of these factors in determining the volume of water retained on the surface."}, {"question": "How does the depth-discharge relationship influence the outflow hydrograph in kinematic wave routing, and what are the implications of assuming a linear depth-time relationship?", "answer": "The depth-discharge relationship, given by q = ay^b, influences the outflow hydrograph by determining how discharge changes with flow depth. Assuming a linear depth-time relationship for rainfall excess, which requires i' = y/t at equilibrium, leads to an outflow hydrograph with no attenuation. This implies that the constant p, representing the proportion of inflow that becomes outflow, is only a function of the coefficient b of the depth-discharge relationship. However, this assumption may not accurately represent real-world scenarios, as empirical evidence suggests that attenuation does occur, particularly for turbulent flow conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of detention storage calculations, why do different equations (e.g., Equation 10-91 vs. Equation 10-92) yield different results, and what are the implications of these differences?", "answer": "Different equations for detention storage, such as Equation 10-91 and Equation 10-92, yield different results because they are based on different assumptions and empirical findings. Equation 10-91 assumes no attenuation at the end of the slope and is considered more theoretical, while Equation 10-92, developed by Izzard, accounts for attenuation and is based on empirical evidence. The choice of equation can significantly impact the calculated detention storage, with Equation 10-92 generally providing more realistic estimates, especially for turbulent flow conditions. The implications of these differences are crucial for accurately modeling sheet flow and understanding the factors that influence detention storage, such as surface roughness and flow regime."}, {"question": "How does the roughness of the surface influence detention storage, according to Izzard's empirical equation (Equation 10-92), and what are the limitations of this equation?", "answer": "According to Izzard's empirical equation (Equation 10-92), the roughness of the surface influences detention storage through the coefficient C, which varies with surface roughness. This equation suggests that detention storage is affected by the interaction between excess inflow rate, surface length, and surface roughness. However, the equation has limitations, as it is accurate only when the product of excess"}]}
{"paragraph": "10.9 MUSKINGUM-CUNGE METHOD Cunge developed a routing method that is more flexible than the hydrologic routing methods discussed in Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5. It can be shown that for certain conditions, Cunge's development is equivalent to the Muskingum Method, thus it is referred to as the Muskingum-Cunge Method. Variations of the Muskingum-Cunge Method, most notably by Ponce and Yevjevich (1978), have been published. The Muslungum-Cunge Method uses physical characteristics to compute the coefficients, rather than the somewhat arbitrary, empirical approach used for estimating x for the Muskingum Method. Specifically, the Muslungum-Cunge Method uses the reach length L and slope So, the kinematic wave celerity c, and a characteristic unit discharge q,. The lunematic wave celerity is defined as Channel Routing Chap. 10 in which W, is the top width of the water surface. The numerator of Equation 10-94 is the slope of the stage-discharge relationship, which should be evaluated at the water surface ele- vation. As an alternative, the celerity is assumed to equal pV, where V is the velocity and p is the power-model exponent of the discharge cross-sectional area curve (see Equation 10-10). Manning's Equation provides a value of 513 for p. The characteristic unit discharge is the ac- tual discharge per unit width at any time, although the mean or peak discharge can be used as an approximation. Cunge provided the following expression for estimating x of Equations 10-51 and 10-54: where L is the reach length. The Muslungum-Cunge Method uses the following expression for estimating K: where c is computed from Equation 10-94. The equation for routing is the same as that used for the Muskingum Method except it is most often expressed in finite-difference form: Qi+l, r+l = ' o Qi, r+i + ' 1 Qi,t + ' 2 Qi+l,r (10-97) + where i is the station indicator (i = upstream section, i 1 = downstream section) and t is the + time indicator (t 1 = next time, t = current time); thus, in comparing Equation 10-53 with Equation 10-97, the following shows that the quantities differ only in notation: Qi+l,,+l = 0 2 Qi,,+, = 12 Qi,, = 11 Qi+l,, = 01 The equations for computing Co, C,, and C2 for the Muskingum-Cunge Method are identical to those for the Muskingum Method, although different notation is often used. The difference in the Muslungum and Muslungum-Cunge Method lies in the way that the parameters are evaluated and the equations applied. If constant values of c and q, are used for all ordinates of the hydrograph, then K and x are constant for all computations, and the computed downstream hydrograph will be identical to that computed using the Musk- ingum Method with the same parameters. However, if c is computed for each ordinate, using Equation 10-94 and q, is the discharge for that ordinate, then x and K will vary with each time step and thus the computed hydrograph will differ from that of the one computed using the Muslungum Method. If the coefficients are allowed to vary with the discharge, then dqldlz and W, of Equa- tion 10-94 and q, of Equation 10-95 will vary with both time and cross section.

Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Discussion Question 623 Case. An engineer is in charge of the hydraulics and hydrology division of his com- pany. It is his responsibility to meet with clients and establish the costs and technical details of all H&H projects. Since he has worked for the firm for over twenty years, he has consider- able flexibility in choosing work for his company. Because of his reputation, he works with very little oversight by the company president. In recent months, the engineer has given prospective clients a very high price tag on projects. When the clients indicate that they will take their work elsewhere, the engineer gives the prospective clients his personal business card and asks them to call him at home that evening, with the remark that he is sure a more favorable price can be negotiated with him personally. The effect on the company's bottom line due to this practice is minimal, although the amount of work in the H&H division de- clines slightly. Reservoir Routing CHAPTER OBJECTIVES 1.

Sec. 11.1 Introduction", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of channel routing, what is the primary difference between the Muskingum-Cunge Method and the Muskingum Method?", "answer": "The primary difference lies in how the parameters are evaluated and applied. The Muskingum-Cunge Method uses physical characteristics such as reach length, slope, kinematic wave celerity, and characteristic unit discharge to compute coefficients, whereas the Muskingum Method uses an empirical approach to estimate these coefficients."}, {"question": "How does the Muskingum-Cunge Method compute the coefficients x and K, and what are the implications of using variable versus constant values for c and q?", "answer": "The Muskingum-Cunge Method computes coefficients x and K using Equations 10-95 and 10-96, which incorporate physical channel characteristics. Using variable values for c and q, which change with each ordinate of the hydrograph, allows for more accurate representation of the flow dynamics but increases computational complexity. In contrast, using constant values simplifies the computation but may reduce accuracy, especially for hydrographs with significant variations in discharge."}, {"question": "Why is the choice of routing interval important in channel routing methods, and what factors should be considered when selecting this interval?", "answer": "The choice of routing interval is crucial because it affects the accuracy and stability of the routing results. The interval should be selected based on factors such as the time to peak of the upstream hydrograph, the travel time of the flow through the reach, and the desired level of detail in the downstream hydrograph. A routing interval that is too long may miss important peaks or variations, while an interval that is too short may introduce unnecessary complexity or instability."}, {"question": "In the context of the Convex Method, what is the role of the routing coefficient C, and how is it estimated?", "answer": "The routing coefficient C in the Convex Method represents the proportion of the inflow that is directly transmitted to the outflow, with the remainder being stored and then released. The coefficient C can be estimated using the principle of least squares or by analyzing the relationship between the upstream and downstream hydrographs. The value of C depends on factors such as the velocity of flow, Manning's Roughness Coefficient, and the characteristics of the stream reach."}, {"question": "How does the modified Att-Kin Method differ from the Convex Method in terms of the underlying assumptions and the information required for application?", "answer": "The modified Att-Kin Method differs from the Convex Method in that it assumes a more complex relationship between the inflow, outflow, and storage, incorporating both translation and attenuation of the hydrograph. The Att-Kin Method requires additional information about the channel, such as the stage-discharge and top width-discharge relationships, to compute the necessary coefficients for routing."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the Muskingum Method versus the Muskingum-Cunge Method for routing a hydrograph through a channel, especially in terms of accuracy and computational effort?", "answer": "The Muskingum Method is generally simpler and less computationally intensive than the Muskingum-Cunge Method but may sacrifice accuracy, particularly for channels with complex geometries or hydrographs with significant variations. The Muskingum-Cunge Method, while more accurate due to its use of physical channel characteristics, requires more detailed input data and computational effort, making it more suitable for situations where high accuracy is critical."}, {"question": "In the context of reservoir routing, what is the significance of the stage-storage-discharge relationship, and how is it derived?", "answer": "The stage-storage-discharge relationship is crucial in reservoir routing as it relates the water level (stage) in the reservoir to the volume of water stored and the outflow discharge. This relationship is derived from the physical characteristics of the reservoir and its outlet works, including the spillway and dam geometry. Accurate derivation of this relationship is essential for predicting the outflow hydrograph from a given inflow hydrograph."}, {"question": "Why is the storage-indication method commonly used in reservoir routing, and what are its advantages over other methods?", "answer": "The storage-indication method is widely used due to its simplicity and the fact that it directly relates the storage in the reservoir to the outflow, making it easy to apply in practice. Its advantages include ease of computation and the ability to handle complex reservoir geometries and outlet structures, although it may require calibration of coefficients based on observed data to achieve high accuracy."}, {"question": "How does the modified Puls Method improve upon the basic storage-indication method, and what additional considerations are required for its application?", "answer": "The modified Puls Method enhances the basic storage-indication method by incorporating additional factors that influence the outflow, such as the effect of the reservoir's water surface area on evaporation and infiltration losses. For its application, additional data on the reservoir's geometry, including the relationship between water surface area and storage, are required. This method offers a more detailed and potentially more accurate representation of the reservoir"}]}

This dimension, along with the length of the minor axis, defines the shape and size of the basin, influencing how water is stored and managed within it. Understanding this parameter is essential for designing basins that meet specific storage needs and for ensuring efficient water management practices."}, {"question": "How does the coefficient of discharge through an orifice affect the flow rate in a two-stage riser system?", "answer": "The coefficient of discharge through an orifice directly influences the flow rate by determining the efficiency with which water passes through the orifice. A higher coefficient indicates a more efficient discharge, leading to a higher flow rate, while a lower coefficient suggests inefficiencies that reduce the flow rate. This coefficient is crucial in the design of two-stage riser systems, as it impacts the overall performance and effectiveness of the system in managing water flow."}, {"question": "In the context of weir design, why is the length of the weir an important consideration?", "answer": "The length of the weir is an important consideration because it affects the discharge capacity of the weir. A longer weir can handle a greater volume of water, making it suitable for applications where high discharge rates are necessary. Conversely, a shorter weir is more appropriate for smaller-scale applications or where lower discharge rates are acceptable. The length of the weir must be carefully selected to match the specific requirements of the water management system it is part of."}, {"question": "What is the role of the acceleration of gravity in the design of water storage facilities?", "answer": "The acceleration of gravity plays a fundamental role in the design of water storage facilities, as it influences the flow of water. With a value of 32.2 ft/sec^2, gravity affects the velocity of flow through orifices, over weirs, and in other components of the facility. Understanding and accounting for gravity's impact is essential for accurately designing facilities that can efficiently manage water flow and storage."}, {"question": "How do the dimensions of the storage facility, such as bottom length and bottom width, impact its storage capacity?", "answer": "The dimensions of the storage facility, including its bottom length and bottom width, directly impact its storage capacity. Larger dimensions result in a greater storage area, allowing for more water to be stored. Conversely, smaller dimensions limit the storage capacity. These dimensions must be carefully considered in the design phase to ensure the facility can meet the required storage needs, taking into account factors such as the expected water inflow and outflow rates."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin design, why is the target discharge an important parameter?", "answer": "The target discharge is a critical parameter in the design of detention basins because it determines the basin's ability to manage stormwater runoff effectively. The target discharge rate should be set to prevent downstream flooding and erosion while also ensuring that the basin does not overflow. Achieving the right balance requires careful consideration of the basin's design, including its size, shape, and outlet structures, to meet the target discharge and protect downstream areas."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the elevation of the bottom of the riser in a two-stage riser system?", "answer": "The elevation of the bottom of the riser is significant because it affects the hydraulic gradient and, consequently, the flow of water through the system. A higher elevation can result in a greater head, potentially increasing the flow rate, while a lower elevation may reduce the head and flow rate. This parameter must be carefully considered to ensure that the system operates efficiently and effectively manages water flow."}, {"question": "How does the angle of side slopes of the storage basin influence its design and operation?", "answer": "The angle of side slopes of the storage basin influences its design and operation by affecting the stability and safety of the basin. Steeper slopes can increase the risk of erosion and instability, particularly during high water levels or intense rainfall events. Shallower slopes, while requiring more land area, provide greater stability and are often preferred in designs where safety and minimal maintenance are priorities. The selection of the appropriate slope angle is a balance between these factors and the available land area."}, {"question": "In the context of water flow, what is the relationship between the velocity of flow and the depth of water above the bottom of the storage facility?", "answer": "The velocity of flow through the facility is related to the depth of water above the bottom of the storage facility. Generally, as the depth of water increases, the velocity of flow also increases due to the greater head and potential energy. However, this relationship can be influenced by other factors such as the roughness of the facility's bottom, the presence of obstacles, and the design of outlet structures. Understanding this relationship is crucial for predicting and managing water flow in storage facilities."}]}
{"paragraph": "11.1 INTRODUCTION Flood routing refers to the process of calculating the passage of a flood hydrograph through a system. If the system is a channel, the general term flood routing is replaced with the specific term channel or streamflow routing. If the system is a reservoir, the term storage routing or reservoir routing is applied. Channel routing was the subject of Chapter 10, and storage rout- ing is the topic of this chapter. Storage routing is similar in many respects to channel routing. The inflow hydrograph to the storage reservoir corresponds to the hydrograph at the upstream cross section. The hy- drograph of the outflow from the reservoir corresponds to the hydrograph at the downstream cross section. Just as the storage in a channel reach affects the shape of the downstream hy- drograph, the storage in a reservoir also affects the characteristics of the outflow hydrograph. As will be shown, the conservation-of-mass equation that was used to develop the routing equation for channel flow is also used in the development of the storage routing equation. Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 A number of design (or synthesis) problems depend on the routing of a flood hydro- graph through a storage facility. In the past, the greatest use of storage routing methods had been for the design of large multipurpose dams. These dams are used for flood control, power generation, to provide for recreation, and to provide a water supply for irrigation. In such designs, the sizing of the spillway requires an understanding of the interrelationships between the storage characteristics at the site and both the physical and energy characteris- tics of the spillway. Knowledge of storage routing has been most necessary in design problems involving the creation of detention facilities used to control runoff from development taking place on small urban and suburban watersheds. Similar to the design of a large dam, the design of a small detention facility for control of urban flooding involves the sizing of the outlet facility. Several hundred thousand small dams have been constructed to provide water supply for farms; the water is used for irrigation and livestock, as well as water supply. Intermediate- sized dams are located close to almost all large urban areas to provide a public water supply. These examples suggest that the design of storage facilities is a common hydrologic design problem. Storage routing is also used extensively in conducting watershed studies for water- sheds where one or more storage facilities exist. Specifically, for watersheds in which exist- ing reservoirs are located, a storage routing method is necessary to evaluate alternative wa- tershed development plans. These plans may be necessary in order to evaluate the effects of such watershed-wide alternatives as (1) zoning plans, (2) location of water supply structures, or (3) regional flood control measures, as well as planning for ultimate watershed develop- ment conditions. 11. I. I Analysis Versus Synthesis In comparison to other hydrologic problems, storage routing is relatively complex. The fol- lowing variables are involved: 1. The input (upstream) hydrograph 2. The output (downstream) hydrograph 3. The stage-storage relationship 4. The energy loss (weir andlor orifice) coefficients 5. Physical characteristics of the outlet facility (weir length, diameter of the riser pipe, length of the discharge pipe) 6. The storage volume-versus-time relationship 7. The depth-discharge relationship 8. The target peak discharge allowed from the reservoir. The problem is further complicated in that the inflow and outflow hydrographs can be from either storms that have occurred (actual measured events) or from design storm models. In the analysis case, the hydrographs (inflow and outflow) are measured runoff events. The stage-storage relationship is known, as it can be determined from site characteristics. Sec. 11.0 Introduction 627 Since the storage facility actually exists, the physical characteristics of the outlet facility are also known. The variables that are not known are the loss coefficients and the stage- discharge relationship, which depend on the loss coefficients. Thus the objective in analysis is to determine values of the loss coefficients. In the synthesis or design case, the inflow hydrograph is usually derived from a design storm model, although the design could be based on a measured hydrograph for a severe storm. The outflow hydrograph is not known, although a target peak discharge, such as the predevelopment peak discharge, is known. The stage-storage relationship is known, and val- ues for the loss coefficients are assumed. The design problem would be to determine (1) the physical characteristics of the outlet facility, which would determine the outflow hydrograph that meets the target discharge, (2) the storage volume-versus-time relationship, and (3) the depth-discharge relationship. Given the importance of detention basin design to practicing engineers, it serves as a useful example that illustrates the difference between analysis and design (synthesis). For our purpose, a detention basin with a two-stage riser will be the problem. In systems analy- sis, the input and output functions are known and the transfer function is unknown. One problem in detention basin analysis is the evaluation of the discharge coefficients (weir and orifice loss coefficients) of a two-stage riser. While values for single-stage risers are avail- able, at the present time, accurate estimates of the discharge coefficients for two-stage risers are not available. The accuracy of single-stage riser coefficients in the design of two-stage risers is questionable because experimental measurements have not shown the degree to which flow over the high-stage weir interferes with the flow through the low-stage orifice. Some design engineers assume that flow from the high-stage outlet drowns out all flow from the low-stage outlet. Other designers assume that the two outlets do not interfere with each other. Thus a valid analysis study would be to build a series of outlet facilities with varying designs of the high- and low-stage outlets and analyze inflow and outflow hydrographs to find accurate estimates of the weirlorifice coefficients of the multistage riser designs. For the design or synthesis problem, the physical characteristics of the outlet facility would be evaluated for a particular site using the weirlorifice coefficients computed in the analysis phase. When using weirlorifice coefficients in design, the designer assumes that the values of the coefficients are accurate. Although this may not be the case, an analysis of the coefficients, sometimes called a calibration, would be prohibitive in cost, especially when one considers that this would involve constructing the facility and then making any necessary retrofitting. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide further discussion of the analysis phase; the remaining portion will deal with the design phase. 11. I. 2 Watershed Planning and Legal Case Studies In addition to the analysis and design problems, two other types of hydrologic studies occur frequently, the watershed planning study and studies required in legal conflicts. Wa- tershed planning studies are often undertaken to assess the hydrologic effects of alternative patterns of land development. These are usually undertaken by county or local govern- ments or by regional planning councils. Such studies often use the design-storm concept. Both existing and planned storage facilities may be involved. In both cases, the objective is to predict the outflow hydrographs for the ultimate conditions of watershed development. Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 Where an existing facility is involved, both the physical characteristics of the outlet and the loss coefficients are known. For a planned facility, a stage-storage-discharge relationship is assumed. For legal cases that involve flooding during an actual storm event, measured rainfall and runoff data would have to be obtained. The data could be used with a watershed model that includes a component for reservoir routing. The effect of a reservoir on downstream flooding might be important in the resolution of the problem. The measured rainfall and the watershed model can be used for the hydrologic part and a hydraulic water surface profile model, such as the Corps of Engineers HEC-2 model, could be used to delineate the water surface profiles.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of reservoir routing, what is the primary goal of storage routing methods?", "answer": "The primary goal of storage routing methods is to calculate the passage of a flood hydrograph through a storage facility, such as a reservoir, to determine the outflow hydrograph and understand the interrelationships between the storage characteristics and the physical and energy characteristics of the spillway."}, {"question": "How do the inflow and outflow hydrographs in storage routing differ from those in channel routing?", "answer": "The inflow hydrograph to the storage reservoir corresponds to the hydrograph at the upstream cross section in channel routing, and the hydrograph of the outflow from the reservoir corresponds to the hydrograph at the downstream cross section. This similarity indicates that storage routing is analogous to channel routing, with the storage in a reservoir affecting the characteristics of the outflow hydrograph, just as storage in a channel reach affects the shape of the downstream hydrograph."}, {"question": "Why is knowledge of storage routing necessary in design problems involving detention facilities for urban flooding control?", "answer": "Knowledge of storage routing is necessary in design problems involving detention facilities for urban flooding control because it allows for the sizing of the outlet facility, which is crucial for controlling runoff from development taking place on small urban and suburban watersheds. The design of a small detention facility involves understanding the interrelationships between the storage characteristics at the site and both the physical and energy characteristics of the spillway, similar to the design of a large dam. This understanding is essential for evaluating alternative watershed development plans and assessing the effects of watershed-wide alternatives, such as zoning plans, location of water supply structures, or regional flood control measures."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin design, what is the main challenge in evaluating the discharge coefficients of a two-stage riser?", "answer": "The main challenge in evaluating the discharge coefficients of a two-stage riser is the lack of accurate estimates of these coefficients, as experimental measurements have not shown the degree to which flow over the high-stage weir interferes with the flow through the low-stage orifice. This challenge arises because designers often assume that flow from the high-stage outlet either drowns out all flow from the low-stage outlet or does not interfere with it, leading to questionable accuracy in using single-stage riser coefficients for two-stage riser designs."}, {"question": "How does the analysis phase in storage routing differ from the design phase?", "answer": "The analysis phase in storage routing involves determining the values of loss coefficients, given that the inflow and outflow hydrographs, stage-storage relationship, and physical characteristics of the outlet facility are known. In contrast, the design phase involves determining the physical characteristics of the outlet facility, storage volume-versus-time relationship, and depth-discharge relationship, assuming values for the loss coefficients and knowing the stage-storage relationship and target peak discharge. The analysis phase is often prohibitive in cost, especially when it involves constructing the facility and making necessary retrofitting, which is why designers often assume the values of the coefficients are accurate."}, {"question": "What is the role of watershed planning studies in hydrologic analysis, and how do they utilize storage routing methods?", "answer": "Watershed planning studies are undertaken to assess the hydrologic effects of alternative patterns of land development, often using the design-storm concept. These studies utilize storage routing methods to predict the outflow hydrographs for the ultimate conditions of watershed development, considering both existing and planned storage facilities. The objective is to evaluate the hydrologic effects of different development scenarios, which can involve using measured rainfall and runoff data, watershed models, and hydraulic water surface profile models to resolve legal conflicts or plan for future development."}, {"question": "In the context of legal cases involving flooding, why is it essential to consider the effect of a reservoir on downstream flooding?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the effect of a reservoir on downstream flooding in legal cases because the reservoir's impact on the flood hydrograph can be significant. By using measured rainfall and runoff data, watershed models, and hydraulic water surface profile models, such as the Corps of Engineers HEC-2 model, it is possible to delineate the water surface profiles and assess the reservoir's role in mitigating or exacerbating downstream flooding. This information can be crucial in resolving legal conflicts related to flooding during actual storm events."}, {"question": "How do the design storm models used in storage routing differ from actual measured events?", "answer": "The design storm models used in storage routing are hypothetical storm events designed to represent the worst-case scenario, whereas actual measured events are real storm events that have occurred.

{"paragraph": "11.2 THE ROUTING EQUATION The equation for storage routing is based on the conservation of mass. Specifically, the in- flow (I),o utflow (O), and storage (S) are related by where dS is the change in storage during the time interval dt. Both I and 0 are time-varying functions, with I and 0 being the inflow and outflow hydrographs, respectively. Approximat- ing dSldt by ASlAt, Equation 11-1 can be rewritten as IAt - OAt = AS (1 1-2) + If the subscripts 1 and 2 are used to indicate values at times t and (t At), respectively, then Equation 11-2 can be written as 1 1 + + - (Il I,) At - - (0, 0,) At = S, - S1 2 2 While I,, I,, O,, and S, are known at any time t, values for 0, and S, are unknown. Equation 11-3 can, ;herefore, be rearranged such that the knowns are placed on the left side of the equal sign and the unknowns on the right side: Equation 11-4 represents one equation with two unknowns (S, and 0,). To find a solution to the problem, it is necessary to have a second equation. In storage routing the storage- discharge relationship is the second equation. The outflow is usually assumed only to be a function of the storage. Although this may not be exactly true for small reservoirs, it is the assumption that is usually made. In practice, the storage-discharge relationship is derived from the stage-discharge and stage-storage relationships. In summary, Equation 11-4 represents the equation for routing a hydrograph through a storage facility. Given the stage-storage-discharge relationship for a site and the facility, the outflow hydrograph can be computed with Equation 11 -4.

This second equation is typically the storage-discharge relationship, which assumes that outflow is a function of storage. This assumption, while not always exact, especially for small reservoirs, is commonly made in practice. The storage-discharge relationship is derived from the stage-discharge and stage-storage relationships, providing a crucial link between the storage and outflow."}, {"question": "In the context of the storage-discharge relationship, how is the outflow typically assumed to relate to storage?", "answer": "The outflow is usually assumed to be only a function of the storage, although this may not be exactly true for small reservoirs.

This relationship is essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of water in storage facilities, such as reservoirs, and for managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "How does the stage-storage-discharge relationship facilitate the computation of the outflow hydrograph?", "answer": "The stage-storage-discharge relationship, when combined with Equation 11-4, allows for the calculation of the outflow hydrograph. This is because the relationship provides the necessary link between the storage and outflow, enabling the solution of the routing equation for the unknown outflow at any given time. By knowing the stage-storage-discharge relationship for a specific site and facility, hydrologists can use Equation 11-4 to compute the outflow hydrograph, which is critical for predicting water levels, managing water supply, and mitigating flood risks."}, {"question": "In the context of storage routing, why is it challenging to solve for the unknowns without a second equation?", "answer": "Without a second equation, it is challenging to solve for the unknowns (S2 and O2) because the routing equation (Equation 11-4) has two unknowns but only provides one equation. This means that there are infinitely many potential solutions, and without additional information or constraints, it is impossible to determine the unique values of S2 and O2. The introduction of a second equation, such as the storage-discharge relationship, provides the necessary constraint to solve for these unknowns uniquely."}, {"question": "How does the assumption that outflow is a function of storage impact the accuracy of hydrological models?", "answer": "The assumption that outflow is a function of storage can impact the accuracy of hydrological models, particularly for small reservoirs where this assumption may not hold. In such cases, the models may not accurately capture the complex relationships between storage and outflow, potentially leading to errors in predicting water levels and outflow hydrographs. However, this assumption is commonly made in practice due to its simplicity and the difficulty of measuring and modeling the more complex relationships that may exist."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not having an accurate storage-discharge relationship for hydrological predictions?", "answer": "Not having an accurate storage-discharge relationship can have significant implications for hydrological predictions, including inaccurate forecasts of water levels, outflow hydrographs, and potential flood risks. This can lead to poor decision-making in water resource management, such as inadequate preparation for floods or inefficient allocation of water resources. Therefore, deriving an accurate stage-storage-discharge relationship is crucial for reliable hydrological predictions and effective water resource management."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, how does the stage-storage-discharge relationship contribute to the overall understanding of water behavior in storage facilities?", "answer": "The stage-storage-discharge relationship is a critical component of hydrological modeling, as it provides a fundamental understanding of how water behaves in storage facilities. By linking the stage (water level), storage, and discharge (outflow), this relationship enables hydrologists to predict how changes in one variable will affect the others. This understanding is essential for managing water resources, predicting flood risks, and optimizing the operation of storage facilities"}]}
{"paragraph": "11.3 DERIVATION OF A STAGE-STORAGE-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIP Routing a hydrograph through a reservoir or detention structure requires the relationship be- tween the stage, storage, and discharge to be known. The stage-storage-discharge (SSD) rela- tionship is a function of both the topography at the site of the storage structure and the char- acteristics of the outlet facility.

{"paragraph": "11.3.1 The Stage-Storage Relationship The stage-storage relationship depends on the topography at the site of the storage structure. Consider the unrealistic case of a site where the topography permits a storage structure that has a horizontal rectangular bottom area with vertical sides. In this case, the storage is simply the bottom area (length times width) multiplied by the depth of storage. If the relationship is plotted on a Cartesian axis system with storage as the ordinate and stage as the abscissa, the stage-storage relationship will be a straight line with a slope equal to the surface area of the storage facility. For the hypothetical case where the bottom of the storage facility is a rectan- gle (L x W), the longitudinal cross section is a trapezoid with base Wand side slopes of angle a, and the ends are vertical, the stage-storage relationship is given by s = - \" + h2 (LW) h tan a in which h is the height above the bed of the storage facility. If Equation 11-5 is plotted on a graph, the stage-storage relationship has the shape of a second-order polynomial with a zero intercept and a shape that depends on the values of L, W, and a. Unless the site undergoes considerable excavation, the simple forms described previ- ously are not \"real world.\" However, the concepts used to derive the stage-storage relation- ship for the simple forms are also used to derive the stage-storage relationship for an actual site. Instead of a continuous function such as Equation 11-5, the stage-storage relationship is derived as a discrete function (a set of points).

The cross-sectional area equals the depth times the length, L (where L is measured into the page in Figure 11-3). Expressing the discharge as a rate per unit length (q,), Equation 1 1-7 becomes Equation 11-8 must be integrated from the water surface (at h = ~,2/2gt)o the top of the weir + (at h = Z ~ 3 2 ~ ) : In truth, the water surface contracts at the cross section above the weir (solid line in Figure 11-3), and thus the discharge is less than that indicated by Equation 11-9. Also, the deriva- tion of Equation 11-9 assumes that losses are negligible. A discharge coefficient C, will be used to account for the losses and flow contraction; thus the flow per unit length q, through the section is Sec. 11.3 Derivation of a Stage-Storage-Discharger Relationship 633 where Cw is the weir coefficient. Experiments have indicated that C, of Equation 11-lOa varies from about 0.6 to 0.75, with a value of about 0.6 for the case where the depth of flow over the weir (Z in Figure 11-3) is small compared with the length of the weir. Expressing Equation 11-lob in terms of the total flow Q, where Q = q,L, we get The value of the weir coefficient of Equation 11-1 1 varies from 2.8 to 3.33, with a value of 3.1 commonly used. Equation ll-l 1 can be used to derive the stage-discharge (Z versus Q) relationship for a sharp-crested weir of length L. In Equation ll-l 1, Q has units of ft3/sec and L and Z have units of ft; for other dimension systems the constant will be different from the value of 3.1 in Equation 1 1-1 1. Example 11-3 Consider the storage facility of Example 11-1. Assume that a 4-ft weir exists at an elevation of 2 ft. Thus, water below the 2-ft datum will not flow over the weir so it is considered dead stor- age; active storage consists of all storage above the weir. At an elevation of 2 ft, the storage would be 455,000 ft3. If a flood resulted in a depth of 5 ft, the total storage would be 1,156,250 ft3, which means that there is 701,250 ft3 of active storage. At a depth of 5 ft, the discharge over the weir would be The stage-discharge relationship could be graphed by computing values of the following equa- tion for selected depths: Example 1 1 4 Equation 11-1 1 can be illustrated for the topographic site in Figure 1 1-1. Assuming that a riser spillway with a sharp-crested weir is required, the stage-discharge relationship was computed for a unit length of 1 ft and is plotted with the stage-storage relationship in Figure 11-2. Orifice equation. In a number of geographic areas, storm water management poli- cies require alternative designs such as two-stage control or dry detention ponds. In either case, an orifice or port may be part of the detention basin outlet facility. The equation that can be used to estimate flow rates through orifices in a riser can be developed from Bernoulli's equation: in which pi, Vi,a nd Zia re the pressure, velocity, and elevation of section i, respectively; and y is the specific weight of the fluid. For the system shown in Figure 1 1 4 , point 1 is at the water surface of the reservoir with surface area A,, and point 2 is at the center of the water jet discharging through the orifice at elevation Z2. The jet of water has a minimum cross- sectional area A :, with the orifice having a slightly larger area A,. The surface area of the reservoir is considered to be much larger than the area of the orifice. The pressure at both the water surface (point 1) and across the jet are assumed to be atmospheric; therefore, p, = p2. Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 Datum FIGURE 11-4 Schematic diagram of flow through an orifice. The difference in elevation heads between points 1 and 2 (4 - Z,) equals the stage in the pond, h. Based on the continuity equation, Q = VA, the velocity of water at the surface of the reservoir (point 1) will be very small compared with V, because A, is so much larger than A,; therefore. it is reasonable to assume that V, = 0. Thus Equation 11-12 becomes Solving for the velocity of the jet yields V2 = (2 gh)0.5 The discharge through the orifice is Q = V,A, = A, (2 gh)0.5 in which Q is the discharge rate in ft3/sec,A , is in ft', and h is in ft. Equation 11-15 assumes that there are no losses in the system and that the area where the pressure across the cross section of the jet equals atmospheric is A,. In practice, there are significant losses, and the cross-sectional area where the pressure equals atmospheric pressure across the section is smaller than the A,. Thus the actual discharge through the orifice is less than that given by Equation 11-15. The coefficient of discharge Cd is used to adjust for losses and area differ- ence (A, versus A;): Q = CdA , (2 gh)0.5 (1 1-16) Experimental studies indicate that Cd is approximately 0.6. Example 11-5 The use of Equation 11-16 can be illustrated for a hypothetical watershed in which the topogra- phy at the detention basin riser can be represented by a half-ellipse with major and minor axes of a and b, respectively (see Figure 11-5). The area of a half-ellipse with semimajor axis A and semiminor axis B is 0.5.rrAB. If the ratio of A to B, which is denoted as r, remains constant for all b, then the area can be written in terms of r and B: Sec. 11.3 Derivation of a Stage-Storage-Discharger Relationship FIGURE 11 -5 Topographic map of half-ellipse with bottom area A,, minor- axis side slope s, and major to minor axis length ratio r = alb (hi= stage for contour line i). For the purpose of illustrating Equation 11-16, we will assume that the area within the first con- tour line h,, denoted as A,, is a horizontal plane. Beyond the contour line h,, the semiminor axis has a slope s,; thus, for the ratio r to remain constant, the slope of the contours along the semi- major axis is r*s,. Assuming that the site shown in Figure 11-5 has a scale of 1 in. = 360 ft and a contour interval of 4 ft, the bottom of the basin has an area (A,) of 20,600 ft2. The surface area for each contour interval is shown in Table 1 1-2; these are used with Equation 1 1-6 to compute the change in storage AS for each contour interval. The cumulative storage S is also shown in Table 11-2. The stage-discharge curve was computed for a riser with an orifice of 12 ft2. The stage-storage-discharge relationship is shown in Figure 11 -6.

{"paragraph": "11.3.3 Stage-Storage-Discharge Relationships for Two-Stage Risers There has been very little theoretical research or empirical studies of the hydraulics of two- stage risers; thus a number of procedures have been proposed for routing through such facili- ties. Some proposals have assumed that, when weir flow begins, flow through the orifice ceases. At the other end of the spectrum, other proposals have assumed that flow through the orifice is independent of flow over the weir. It would probably be more realistic to assume TABLE 11-2 Stage-Storage-Discharge Relationship for the Site in Figure 11-5 Area AS Storage Discharge h b a (ft2> (acre-ft) (acre-ft) (ft3/sec) Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 I & 150 0 L X loo ii Stage (ft) FIGURE 11-6 Stage-storage discharge realtionship for site of Figure 11-5 and a riser with an orifice of 12 ft'. that the two are not independent and that, as the depth of storage above the elevation of the weir increases, the interdependence between weir flow and orifice flow increases. This inter- dependence is recognized in the calculations of the orifice flow Q, in the SCS two-stage riser method; specifically, Q, is calculated by in which Cd is the discharge coefficient and is assumed equal to 0.6, and E2 and El are the maximum water surface elevations in the reservoir at routed high and low stages, respec- tively. Equation 11-18 implies that the effective head controlling flow through the orifice is the same head as that controlling flow over the weir, which is a reasonable assumption if the riser pipe is reasonably full. Under such an assumption the general form of the stage- discharge relationship is in which 11, is the elevation of the bottom of the riser, H, is the maximum height of the ori- fice, and h, is the elevation of the weir. Example 11-6 To illustrate the use of Equation 11-16 in deriving a stage-discharge relationship, assume that the riser of a detention structure has the physical characteristics shown in Figure 11-7. The riser has a diameter of 5 ft, and the top of the riser acts as a sharp-crested weir of length L = 5 ~frt. The orifice has an area of 8 ft2. Assuming that the weir coefficients are 3.1 and the discharge coeffi- cient for the orifice is 0.6, the stage-discharge relationship is given by Sec. 11.3 Derivation of a Stage-Storage-Discharger Relationship FIGURE 11-7 Two-stage riser config- uration. In this relationship h is measured from the bottom of the riser. Since the bottom of the low-stage orifice is at a stage of 4 ft, there will be a wet pond to a depth of 4 ft before discharge begins. For the low-stage event, the orifice will act as a weir until the orifice is submerged. When the stage exceeds 6 ft, the orifice will act as an orifice rather than a weir. Above a stage of 9 ft, water passes through the orifice and over the crest of the riser. The outlet pipe would have to be sized so that it does not limit the flow through the outlet structure. The relationship of Equation 11-20 also assumes that the flow through the orifice is not inhibited by the flow over the weir. For this purpose, the diameter of the riser should be at least three times the diameter of the outlet pipe (D). The stage-discharge relationship can be combined with the stage-storage relationship to produce a stage-storage-discharge relationship. For example, if we assume a basin has a rectan- gular floor with a length of 1000 ft and a width of 400 ft and sloping sides with a = 30°, the stage-storage relationship can be represented by Equation 11-5. If the riser defined by Figure 11-7 and Equation 11-20 is used and the floor of the basin is at an elevation of 0 ft, the stage- storage-discharge curve is given in Table 11-3.

The storage-discharge relationship is used to derive the storage-indication curve, which is a rela- + tionship between 0 and (S OAt/2), where the latter is the right-hand side of Equation 11-4. Given the storage-discharge curve, 0 versus S, the following four-step procedure can be used to develop the storage-indication curve: 1. Select a value of 0 . 2. Determine the corresponding value of S from the storage-discharge curve. + 3. Use the values of S and 0 to compute (S OAtl2). + 4. Plot a point on the storage-indication curve 0 versus (S OAtl2). These four steps are repeated for a sufficient number of values of 0 to cover the range of dis- + charges expected in the outflow hydrograph. The set of values of 0 and (S OAtl2) define the storage-indication curve, which can be graphed with 0 as the ordinate. The objective of the storage-indication method is to derive the outflow hydrograph. There are five data requirements: 1. The storage-discharge relationship 2. The storage-indication curve 3. The inflow hydrograph 4. Initial values of the storage and outflow rate 5. The routing increment (At) While the outflow hydrograph is the primary output for most design problems, the storage function (S versus t) is also a necessary output of the storage-indication routing pro- cedure. The maximum value of S from the S-versus-t relationship is the required storage vol- ume at maximum flood stage. The maximum storage occurs when the outflow rate first ex- ceeds the inflow rate, which is the point on the recession curve where the inflow hydrograph becomes less than the outflow hydrograph. The following five-step procedure can be used to derive the outflow hydrograph, with the storage-time relationship as a by-product: + 1. Determine the average inflow: 0.5At(I, I,). 2. Compute: (S, 1', 0, At). - + 3. Using Equation 11-4 and the values from Steps 1 and 2, compute S , l/,O,At. 4. Using the value computed in Step 3 as input, find 0, from the storage-indication curve. 5. Use 0, with the storage-discharge relationship to obtain S,. These five steps are repeated for the next time increment using I,, O,, and S , as the new val- ues of I,, O,, and S,, respectively. The process is solved iteratively until the outflow hydro- graph is computed.

This can be a source of error if the time increment At is not chosen correctly. The averaging of the inflow + [that is, (I, 1,)/2] assumes linearity; therefore, At should be sufficiently short so that the as- sumption of linearity is not violated and that the peak of the outflow hydrograph is not missed, which can occur if At is too large.

As the depth of storage above the elevation of the weir increases, the interdependence between the two types of flow increases, impacting the accuracy of discharge calculations. This interdependence is recognized in the SCS two-stage riser method, where the orifice flow Q is calculated considering the discharge coefficient and the maximum water surface elevations in the reservoir."}, {"question": "How does the stage-storage-discharge relationship influence the design of detention structures?", "answer": "The stage-storage-discharge relationship plays a vital role in the design of detention structures as it determines the required storage volume at maximum flood stage. By combining the stage-discharge relationship with the stage-storage relationship, engineers can produce a stage-storage-discharge curve, which helps in sizing the outlet pipe and ensuring that it does not limit the flow through the outlet structure. This relationship also informs the design of the riser configuration, including the diameter and elevation of the orifice and weir, to achieve the desired flow characteristics."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the time increment At in the routing equation of Equation 11-4?", "answer": "The time increment At is critical in the routing equation because it affects the accuracy of the outflow hydrograph computation. If At is too large, it may lead to errors due to the assumption of linearity, and the peak of the outflow hydrograph might be missed. Therefore, At should be chosen sufficiently short to ensure linearity and capture the peak outflow accurately. This consideration is particularly important in reservoir routing, where the inflow and outflow hydrographs are represented as discrete points rather than continuous functions."}, {"question": "In the context of storage-indication routing, what are the primary outputs, and how are they obtained?", "answer": "The primary outputs of the storage-indication routing method are the outflow hydrograph and the storage-time relationship. These outputs are obtained through a five-step procedure that involves determining the average inflow, computing the storage at each time step, and using the storage-indication curve to find the outflow rate. The process is solved iteratively until the outflow hydrograph is computed, providing essential information for design and analysis of reservoirs and detention structures."}, {"question": "How does the storage-indication curve relate to the storage-discharge relationship, and what is its purpose in reservoir routing?", "answer": "The storage-indication curve is a relationship between the outflow rate and the term (S + ΔS/2Δt), which is derived from the storage-discharge curve. The purpose of the storage-indication curve is to facilitate the computation of the outflow hydrograph by providing a direct relationship between the outflow rate and the storage at each time step. This curve is essential in the storage-indication routing method, as it allows for the efficient calculation of the outflow hydrograph and the storage-time relationship."}, {"question": "What are the implications of assuming that flow through the orifice is independent of flow over the weir in two-stage risers?", "answer": "Assuming that flow through the orifice is independent of flow over the weir in two-stage risers can lead to inaccurate discharge calculations. This assumption neglects the interdependence between the two types of flow, which can result in incorrect estimates of the required storage volume and outlet pipe sizing. In reality, the interdependence between weir flow and orifice flow increases as the depth of storage above the elevation of the weir increases, affecting the overall discharge characteristics of the two-stage riser."}, {"question": "In the context of detention structure design, why is it important to ensure that the outlet pipe does not limit the flow through the outlet structure?", "answer": "Ensuring that the outlet pipe does not limit the flow through the outlet structure is crucial in detention structure design because it directly affects the performance of the structure during flood events. If the outlet pipe is undersized, it can restrict the flow, leading to increased storage volumes and potentially causing the structure to overflow. By sizing the outlet pipe correctly, engineers can ensure that the detention structure operates as intended, providing the necessary flood protection and water quality benefits."}, {"question": "How does the stage-discharge relationship in two-stage risers change as the stage exceeds the elevation of the weir?", "answer": "As the stage exceeds the elevation of the weir in two-stage risers, the orifice acts as an orifice rather than a weir, and water passes through both the orifice and over the crest of the riser. This change in flow regime affects the stage-discharge relationship, as the flow through the orifice becomes more significant, and the interdependence between weir flow and orifice flow increases. The stage-discharge relationship must account for this change to accurately model the flow characteristics of the two-stage riser."}]}

Given the inflow hydrograph, a tabular computation sheet can be devel- oped to iteratively solve Equation 11-21. Assuming that initial values of outflow 0, and stor- age S, are known, the terms on the left side of Equation 11-21 are known. Unlike the storage-indication method, it is not necessary to compute the average inflow; the sum of inflow ordinates for adjacent time periods is used. Given I,, I,, S,, O,, and At, the value of the left side of Equation 11-21 is computed and used as input to the graph of 0 versus + [(2SlAt) 01, from which the value for 0, is obtained. The storage S,, which corresponds to O,, is then computed from the storage-outflow relationship. This completes an iteration, and the values of 0 and S for the next time period are computed using the most recent values as the input to Equation 11-21. The iteration procedure is continued until the entire outflow hy- drograph is generated. As a check, the volume of outflow should be computed and compared with the volume of inflow; the volumes equal the product of the time increment and the sum of the hydro- graph ordinates. The volume of outflow may be slightly less than the volume of the inflow when the iteration procedure is discontinued before the outflow is essentially zero. The vol- umes of inflow and outflow are equal because the routing is based on the conservation of mass, which is represented by Equation 11-1. Small differences in the volumes of inflow + and outflow can also result from errors in reading the 0-versus-S and 0-versus-[(2SIAt) 01 graphs.

The calculations of the outflow hydrograph and storage-versus-time rela- tionship are given in Table 11-6. The outflow hydrograph is essentially identical to the outflow hydrograph computed by the storage-indication method because the two procedures are essen- tially identical. The area between the inflow and outflow hydrographs represents the storage. The maximum storage occurs where the two hydrographs intersect, which is at a storm time of approximately 43 min; after this point the storage is reduced since the outflow rate is greater than the inflow rate. From the conservation-of-mass equation (Equation 11-I), 0 is greater than I, so ASlAt is negative. The volume of inflow equals 125 ft3/sec (10 min)(60 seclmin) or 75,000 ft3. The volume of outflow equals 121.5 (ft3/sec) (10 min)(60 seclrnin) = 72,900 ft3. The difference of 2100 ft3 represents the errors from discontinuing computation of 0 at a time of 120 rnin and from reading the curve of Figure 11-8.

{"paragraph": "11.6 DESIGN PROCEDU-RE It is worthwhile to review the two general types of hydrologic synthesis problems for whlch storage routing methods are used. First, watershed studies are frequently conducted where structures currently exist. In this case, the objective is to route the design-flood hydrograph through the existing structure using the known stage-storage-discharge relationship. Very often watershed studies will be undertaken to evaluate the hydrologic effects of various land use conditions, such as a natural state, current conditions, and completely developed, or for Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 different zoning practices. For such watershed studies the routing is not undertaken as part of the design of the structure. The second case of hydrologic synthesis is the design of the outlet facility. Quite often, the design of a storage facility centers around a target discharge. For example, in the design of urban detention basins, storm water management policies may require the post- development peak discharge to be no greater than the peak discharge for the pre- development watershed conditions at a selected exceedence frequency (return period). In de- signing the riser to meet the target discharge, one must identify the riser characteristics (weir length andlor area of the orifice) that will limit the computed post-development peak dis- charge out of the detention basin so that it does not exceed the target discharge, which is usu- ally the peak discharge that would occur if development had not taken place within the wa- tershed. The stage-storage-discharge relationship is a function of both the target discharge and the riser characteristics. Because of this interdependence, the design procedure is itera- tive. That is, the design procedure begins with some assumption about the riser characteris- tics. Then the storage routing procedure is applied to determine whether or not the target dis- charge requirement has been met. The riser characteristics are continually modified until the target discharge is met. If the weir length is too long or the orifice too large, the target dis- charge will be exceeded. If the computed discharge is less than the target discharge (that is, the weir length is too short or the orifice is too small), the design will result in storage that is greater than that really required. The design procedure is summarized in the flowchart of Figure 11-10. There are three initial steps: (I) establish the stage-storage relationship; (2) establish the stage-discharge re- lationship; and (3) compute the design inflow hydrograph and the target discharge (that is, the allowable discharge out of the basin). The stage-storage curve is computed from topo- graphic information at the site of the storage facility. To compute the stage-discharge rela- tionship requires assumptions about the riser outlet, including the number of stages and whether weirs, orifices, or both are used to control the outflow. The assumed weir lengths andlor orifice areas and the elevations are used to compute the stage-discharge relationship. The stage-storage and stage-discharge curves are then used to compute both the storage- indication and storage-discharge curves. The final step in the input is to obtain the initial conditions. This includes the routing interval, the target outflow discharge, initial values for the outflow and active storage (which are both usually zero), and the inflow hydrograph, which is usually the hydrograph for the post-development conditions computed with a design rainfall hyetograph and a unit hydrograph. Based on these inputs and initial computations, the inflow hydrograph can be routed through the storage basin; this begins at node B in Figure 11-10. The routing procedure was detailed in Section 11.4. Once the outflow hydrograph is computed, its peak discharge is compared to the target discharge q,. If it is greater than q,, then the assumed outlet configu- ration has too large a capacity. Thus, the weir lengths or orifice areas should be decreased (return to node A in Figure 11-10). If the peak discharge of the outflow is less than the target discharge q,, then the assumed outlet configuration does not provide for sufficient outflow. The weir lengths or orifice areas can be increased (return to node A in Figure 11-10). This will require recomputing the stage-discharge relationship, the storage-indication curve, and the storage-discharge curve. The routing process, which begins at node B of Figure 11-10, is then repeated with the new stage-storage-discharge information, and the maximum discharge Sec. 11 .6 Design Procedure 645 7 BEGIN 8 Set weir set At lengthlorifice I Set initial values of O1 and S1 Compute stage- discharge Set Tm , = time of last ordinate of outflow hydrograph Compute and graph storage- t indication curve Compute inflow hydrograph, I(t + Set target discharge, q , Compute and graph storage-discharge curve t 'Set riser configuration: (1 ) single or two-stage; (2) weirlorifice outlet I t Set discharge coefficients v Establish topo information for site of structure FIGURE 11-10 Reservoir Storage Design Process. 646 Reservoir Routing Chap. 11 of the new outflow hydrograph compared to the target discharge. When the peak outflow ap- proximately equals the target discharge, then the assumed outlet facility is a reasonable de- sign. The required storage is estimated by the largest value of storage S,. The depth of stor- age is estimated by using the maximum S, as input to the stage-storage curve. The computed design should be evaluated for safety and cost. Example 11-9 A detailed example will be used to illustrate the design process. The watershed has a drainage area of 38.3 acre and is entirely in C soil. The design will use a 10-yr exceedence frequency. In the before-development condition, the watershed was 40% forest in good condition (CN = 70) and 60% in brush in good condition (CN = 65); therefore, the weighted CN is 67. For after- development conditions, the watershed has the following land cover: 10 acres of 118-acre lots (CN = 90); 14 acres of 114-acre lots (CN = 83); 5 acres of light commercial (75% impervious); and 9.3 acres of open space in good condition (CN = 74). The CN for the commercial area is + 0.75(98) 0.25(74) = 92. Thus, the weighted CN for the watershed is 1 + + + CNa = --- [lo (90) 14 (83) 5 (92) 9.3 (74)J = 83.8 (use 84) 38.2 Characteristics of the principal flow paths for both watershed conditions are given in Table 11-7. For a 10-yr exceedence frequency, Figure 4-4 gives a 24-hr rainfall depth of 4.8 in. Using the before- and after-development CNs, the rainfall depths are computed from Equation 7 4 2 as 1.67 and 3.09 in., respectively. The initial abstractions are 0.895 and 0.381 in., which yields IJP ratios of 0.21 and 0.08 (use 0.1) for pre- and post-development, respectively. Using the times of concentration and the IJP ratios, unit peak discharges of 500 and 710 csmlin. are taken from Figure 7-9 for the before and after conditions, respectively.

The de- tention basin must be designed to reduce the peak discharge from 131 cfs to 50 cfs. The stage-storage relationship is computed from topographic information. At the site where the detention structure will be located, surface areas were estimated from the topographic map at an increment of 0.5 ft (see Table 11-8). The product of the average area (column 3) and the incremental depth of 0.5 ft yields the incremental storage (column 4). The storage for any stage is the accumulated incremental storage. A graphical presentation of columns 1 and 5 would be the stage-storage relationship. The values were used to fit the following power model: The design policy requires a one-stage riser with a weir. The inflow hydrograph will be routed using the storage-indication method. An initial estimate of the weir length is made using the weir equation, with an assumed depth of 5 ft: Thus, an initial length of 1.5 ft will be used. The stage-storage-discharge relationship and the storage-indication curve are given in Table 11-9. For design, an input hydrograph is necessary. The TR-20 computer program was used to derive the input hydrograph. The ordinates on a 0.1-hr increment are given in Table 11-10. Only the values for storm times from 11.0 to 13.2 hr are given. The inflow hydrograph is routed with the storage-indication method; the results are given in Table 11-10. The largest outflow occurred at 102 min, which is storm time 12.7 hr. The peak outflow is 45.2 cfs, which is less than the allowable peak of 50 cfs. The maximum storage is 16 1,000 ft3. Since the computed peak is less than the allowable peak, the required storage volume can be reduced by allowing a higher peak discharge out of the basin. Thus, the weir length was in- creased to 2.0 ft and the computations repeated. Since the weir length is changed, the stage- discharge and storage-indication curves must be recomputed (see Table 11-1 1).

The larger weir length reduced the required storage by about 6,500 ft3 and thus the maximum water surface ele- vation by about 0.1 ft. PROBLEMS 11-1.

Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. Discussion Question 655 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case An engineer has been involved in the design of many large reservoir spillways for flood control and water supply dams. The engineer attends a workshop on the subject and based on the material presented deduces that he has not been applying the design concepts correctly. After the workshop, he does some calculations and, while almost all of his past de- sign projects are safe, two spillways may not pass the design discharge that was required. He believes that the dams are safe for the moment but could fail for some floods less than the design flood. He recognizes that if he makes it known that the two projects are under- designed, his reputation will be tarnished and his company will be responsible for costly retrofitting of the two spillways.

This approach enables the evaluation of the impact of different reservoir designs and operations on downstream water levels and flow rates. By considering the stage-storage-discharge relationship, reservoir routing methods can account for the complex interactions between the reservoir's water level, storage volume, and outflow rate, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior."}, {"question": "Why is the stage-discharge relationship for flow through a weir or orifice important in reservoir routing?", "answer": "The stage-discharge relationship for flow through a weir or orifice is crucial in reservoir routing because it determines the outflow rate from the reservoir based on the water level and the characteristics of the outlet facility. This relationship is essential for accurately estimating the outflow hydrograph and evaluating the performance of the reservoir in controlling floods or managing water supply. The stage-discharge relationship is influenced by factors such as the length and depth of the weir, the size and shape of the orifice, and the energy loss characteristics of the outlet facility, making it a critical component of reservoir routing analysis."}, {"question": "In the context of detention basin design, how do engineers determine the required storage volume and outlet facility characteristics to limit peak outflow rates?", "answer": "Engineers determine the required storage volume and outlet facility characteristics for a detention basin by using a trial-and-error approach, where they iteratively modify the outlet facility's design, such as the weir length or orifice size, until the peak outflow rate is within the desired limit. This process involves routing the inflow hydrograph through the detention basin using the storage-indication method or other routing techniques, and adjusting the outlet facility's design until the peak outflow rate meets the design criteria. The required storage volume is then estimated based on the maximum storage value obtained during the routing process, and the depth of storage is determined using the stage-storage relationship."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the storage-indication curve in reservoir routing, and how is it related to the storage-discharge relationship?", "answer": "The storage-indication curve is a relationship between the storage volume and the outflow rate, and it is used to determine the outflow hydrograph from the inflow hydrograph and the physical characteristics of the reservoir and its outlet facility. The storage-indication curve is related to the storage-discharge relationship, as it provides a means of estimating the outflow rate based on the storage volume and the characteristics of the outlet facility. The storage-indication curve is typically plotted as a function of the storage volume and the outflow rate, and it is used in conjunction with the storage-discharge relationship to route the inflow hydrograph and estimate the outflow hydrograph."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the value issues and technical aspects of a project in hydrology, as illustrated in the discussion question?", "answer": "It is essential to consider both the value issues and technical aspects of a project in hydrology because they are often intertwined and can have significant implications for the project's success and the stakeholders involved. Value issues, such as the potential consequences of a dam failure or the impact of a project on the environment, must be carefully considered and balanced against technical aspects, such as the design and operation of the reservoir or detention basin. By acknowledging and addressing these value issues, hydrologists can ensure that their technical decisions are informed by a broader understanding of the project's context and potential consequences, ultimately leading to more effective and responsible decision-making."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt runoff estimation, what are some of the key factors that influence the accuracy of the estimates?", "answer": "The accuracy of snowmelt runoff estimates is influenced by several key factors, including the quality of the input data, the complexity of the snowmelt model, and the representation of the physical processes involved. Other factors, such as the spatial and temporal distribution of snowpack, the effects of vegetation and soil moisture, and the impact of climate change, can also significantly affect the accuracy of the estimates. By carefully considering these factors and using appropriate models and data, hydrologists can improve the accuracy of their snowmelt runoff estimates and provide more reliable information for water management decisions."}, {"question": "How do conceptual and empirical models differ in their approach to estimating snowmelt runoff, and what are the implications of these differences?", "answer": "Conceptual models of snowmelt runoff are based on a physical understanding of the processes involved, such as the energy balance and the movement of water through the snowpack.

This factor is essential in models like the Martinec Model, where it helps in estimating the snowmelt runoff depth based on the number of degree-days. The accuracy of 'a' significantly affects the overall runoff prediction, making it a key parameter in hydrological studies."}, {"question": "How does the characteristic (C) relate to the volume of water available for runoff, and what implications does this have for watershed management?", "answer": "The characteristic (C) is an indicator of the volume of water available for runoff, suggesting that it plays a critical role in determining the potential runoff from a watershed. This relationship has significant implications for watershed management, as understanding and accurately predicting the volume of water available for runoff can help in planning for flood control, water supply management, and ecosystem preservation. For instance, a high value of C might indicate a higher potential for runoff, necessitating measures to mitigate flood risks or optimize water storage and release strategies."}, {"question": "In the context of the Martinec Model, why is the number of degree-days (T) important for estimating snowmelt runoff depth?", "answer": "The number of degree-days (T) is important in the Martinec Model because it directly affects the estimation of snowmelt runoff depth. The model utilizes the degree-day factor and the number of degree-days to calculate the snowmelt runoff depth, which is a critical component of predicting runoff volumes and rates. This highlights the importance of accurate temperature data and the understanding of how temperature influences snowmelt, as small variations in temperature can significantly impact the number of degree-days and, consequently, the estimated snowmelt runoff depth."}, {"question": "What is the role of the recession coefficient (k) in modeling runoff, and how does it impact the prediction of runoff rates over time?", "answer": "The recession coefficient (k) plays a vital role in modeling runoff as it determines the rate at which runoff decreases over time. This coefficient is essential in predicting the recession limb of the hydrograph, which represents the decline in runoff rate after the peak flow has passed. The value of k affects how quickly the runoff rate diminishes, with higher values indicating a faster recession. Accurately determining k is crucial for predicting runoff rates over time, especially in the context of managing water resources and mitigating the effects of flooding or drought."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is the distinction between seasonal snowmelt runoff (Qs) and winter runoff (Qw) important?", "answer": "The distinction between seasonal snowmelt runoff (Qs) and winter runoff (Qw) is important because these two components of runoff have different characteristics and are influenced by different factors. Seasonal snowmelt runoff is primarily driven by the melting of snowpack and is crucial for understanding and predicting water availability during the spring and summer months. In contrast, winter runoff is more directly influenced by precipitation and can have significant implications for flood control and water management during the winter season. Distinguishing between these two types of runoff allows for more accurate modeling and prediction of runoff patterns, which is essential for effective water resource management."}, {"question": "How does the runoff coefficient (C) for the Martinec Model influence the estimation of snowmelt runoff, and what factors might affect its value?", "answer": "The runoff coefficient (C) in the Martinec Model influences the estimation of snowmelt runoff by modifying the calculated runoff based on the characteristics of the watershed. This coefficient can be affected by various factors including the soil type, vegetation cover, and topography of the watershed. A higher runoff coefficient might indicate that a larger proportion of the snowmelt will become runoff, whereas a lower coefficient suggests that more of the snowmelt will be absorbed or retained within the watershed. Understanding and accurately determining the runoff coefficient is critical for improving the accuracy of snowmelt runoff predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt runoff modeling, what is the significance of the proportionality constant (K) between snowmelt runoff depth and the number of degree-days?", "answer": "The proportionality constant (K) is significant because it establishes a quantitative relationship between the snowmelt runoff depth and the number of degree-days, allowing for the estimation of runoff based on temperature data. This constant is crucial for models that rely on degree-day methods for predicting snowmelt runoff, as it enables the conversion of temperature data into runoff volumes. The value of K can vary depending on the location and specific conditions of the watershed, highlighting the need for local calibration of snowmelt runoff models to ensure accurate predictions."}]}
{"paragraph": "12.1 INTRODUCTION Most hydrologic design problems involve either peak discharge estimation or flood hydro- graph development. These methods are important because they are associated with the type of engineering analysis in which the greatest volume of design work is involved. Specifi- cally, they are required for designs associated with urban and suburban development. For other types of hydrologic problems, volumes of runoff over extended periods of time (up to 180 days) are important. Water supply for agriculture, power generation, urban water uses, recreation, and pollution abatement are just some of the needs where the volume of water is the design variable. Although some of the methods of analysis and synthesis used in peak discharge and flood hydrograph modeling are applicable to water yield estimation, the importance of the subject justifies a separate discussion of the application of these methods. Snowmelt-runoff analysis is a special case of water-yield analysis. Snow is the major source of water supply and the major cause of flood-producing runoff in many parts of the western United States. Planning for agriculture, municipal water supply, energy generation, recreation, navigation, flood control, and pollution control depend on reliable forecasts of snowmelt runoff. Due to the increasing complexity and interaction of the various water uses, more accurate forecasting is essential for optimum water resources management. The contin- uing need for improved water supply forecasts is accentuated by the monetary benefit de- rived from a given percentage increase in forecast accuracy. For example, based only on im- proved management of power production and irrigation, Hamon (1972) estimated a $6.2 million annual return for a 1% improvement in the January 1, 1972, Columbia River forecast at the Dallas, Oregon. Decades later, the benefits are most likely much greater. Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 Recognizing the importance of estimates of water yield and snowmelt runoff, methods of estimation are required. Ideally, theory would provide the basis for such estimation. Un- fortunately, the inputs required to use theoretical developments in this area are difficult to collect or require excessive resources; furthermore, little historical data records of such mea- surements are available, which would make it difficult to test the theoretical models. Fortunately, empirical models, which are an alternative to the theoretical models, have proven to provide reasonably accurate estimates of water yield and snowmelt runoff, espe- cially for durations longer than 60 days. The data required to use these empirical models are readily available in many locations where such estimates are required. Although the empirical formulas are used almost exclusively for actual water-yield es- timation, it is worthwhile to take a cursory look at the theoretical approach to snowmelt- runoff estimation.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic design problems, what are the primary methods involved?", "answer": "The primary methods involved are peak discharge estimation and flood hydrograph development, which are crucial for designs associated with urban and suburban development."}, {"question": "Why are volumes of runoff over extended periods important in hydrologic problems?", "answer": "Volumes of runoff over extended periods are important because they are essential for water supply needs such as agriculture, power generation, urban water uses, recreation, and pollution abatement, where the volume of water is the design variable."}, {"question": "How does snowmelt-runoff analysis relate to water-yield analysis?", "answer": "Snowmelt-runoff analysis is a special case of water-yield analysis, as snow is a major source of water supply and a significant cause of flood-producing runoff in many parts of the western United States, making it critical for planning and management of various water uses."}, {"question": "In the context of water resources management, why is accurate forecasting of snowmelt runoff essential?", "answer": "Accurate forecasting of snowmelt runoff is essential because it enables optimum water resources management, and even a small improvement in forecast accuracy can result in significant monetary benefits, as demonstrated by the estimated $6.2 million annual return for a 1% improvement in the January 1, 1972, Columbia River forecast."}, {"question": "What challenges are associated with using theoretical models for estimating water yield and snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "The challenges associated with using theoretical models include the difficulty in collecting required inputs, the need for excessive resources, and the lack of historical data records, which makes it hard to test and validate these models."}, {"question": "How do empirical models address the limitations of theoretical models in estimating water yield and snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "Empirical models provide a viable alternative to theoretical models, as they can offer reasonably accurate estimates of water yield and snowmelt runoff, especially for durations longer than 60 days, using readily available data, which is a significant advantage in locations where such estimates are required."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt-runoff estimation, what is the role of theoretical approaches?", "answer": "Although empirical formulas are used almost exclusively for actual water-yield estimation, taking a cursory look at the theoretical approach to snowmelt-runoff estimation is still worthwhile, as it provides a foundation for understanding the underlying processes and can potentially inform the development of more accurate empirical models."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the monetary benefits of improved forecast accuracy in water resources management?", "answer": "Considering the monetary benefits of improved forecast accuracy is important because it highlights the significant economic value of accurate forecasting, as demonstrated by the estimated $6.2 million annual return for a 1% improvement in the January 1, 1972, Columbia River forecast, which can inform investment decisions and prioritize resource allocation in water resources management."}, {"question": "How do the various water uses interact and impact the need for accurate forecasting of snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "The various water uses, such as agriculture, municipal water supply, energy generation, recreation, navigation, flood control, and pollution control, interact and impact the need for accurate forecasting of snowmelt runoff, as they all depend on reliable forecasts to ensure optimum water resources management, and the increasing complexity of these interactions accentuates the need for more accurate forecasting."}, {"question": "What are the implications of improved forecast accuracy for water resources management, and how can it be achieved?", "answer": "Improved forecast accuracy has significant implications for water resources management, as it can result in substantial monetary benefits, enhanced planning and decision-making, and more effective management of water resources.

{"paragraph": "12.2 SNOWMELT-RUNOFF MODELING Models for estimating seasonal water yield often relate factors, such as snow water equiva- lent observations, monthly precipitation, and observations on baseflow during the fall of the previous year, to seasonal water yield (SCS, 1970; Zuzel, 1975). Because of the lengthy time duration involved (3 to 5 months), much of the variation apparent over shorter time intervals is smoothed out. This data smoothing makes it possible to obtain fairly accurate results from models with simple structures and small input data requirements. The reliability of such models is often assessed using goodness-of-fit statistics, such as the correlation coefficient and the standard error of estimate. Although these criteria reflect the ability of a proposed model to fit the observed data, they may not be a good indication of the accuracy of future estimates, especially when the model was developed from a small sample of limited range. This is especially true in years of extreme, either large or small, snowfalls. Besides the statistical criteria of goodness of fit, an investigator should (1) examine the empirical coefficients for rationality in sign and magnitude; (2) compare the relative impor- tance of the predictor variables, as identified by the model and the investigator's knowledge of the system being modeled; and (3) examine the residuals (that is, the predicted value of the criterion variable minus the observed value) to ensure that the model provides reasonable estimates over the entire range of prediction. To obtain a reliable model, an investigator should give consideration to the data analy- sis concepts of model formulation and model calibration. Besides the linear structure, other model structures (that is, a square-root or logarithmic transformation) should be investigated. A correlation analysis and transformations of the data are useful in selecting the best rela- tionship between water yield and the predictor variables. Data transformations may signifi- cantly increase the goodness-of-fit statistics and decrease the correlation between predictor variables, thus providing a more reliable model in terms of model selection criteria other than the goodness-of-fit statistics. Besides the model formulation stage, an investigator should give consideration to model calibration. A linear model that relates water yield to a set of predictor variables is often selected because experience has shown such a model yields high correlation coeffi- cients; these models are most often calibrated using the principle of least squares. However. Sec. 12.3 Empirical Formulas 659 the frequently used multiple regression technique has some serious pitfalls; most notable are the irrational coefficients that result when two or more of the predictor variables are hghly correlated among themselves. In such cases, an investigator should select a model calibration procedure that is not sensitive to such intercorrelation between predictors. Principal compo- nents regression analysis (McCuen, 1993), which is a feasible alternative to multiple regres- sion, attempts to avoid irrational coefficients by discarding some of the troublesome intercor- relation through eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis. Stepwise regression (McCuen, 1993) avoids intercorrelation by removing those predictor variables that cause statistically signifi- cant intercorrelation. In summary, the use of a systematic and comprehensive strategy for model formulation and calibration should lead to a more reliable model. Probably the most widely used snowmelt forecast model is the linear regression equation, with both the bivariate and multivariate models being used. Hawley et al. (1980) showed that the accuracy of the regression model increased significantly as the length of the forecast pe- riod increased, with high accuracy for forecast periods of 60 days and longer. The volume of snowmelt runoff is used as the criterion (dependent) variable. The predictor (independent) variables may include snow water equivalent measurements, previous season runoff volumes (baseflow rates at the end of the previous year), and monthly or seasonal precipitation vol- umes. In many cases, several snow stations may be located in or near the watershed; in such cases, the individual measurements are used as separate predictor variables, while in some cases a weighted average of the individual measurements is used as a predictor variable. When numerous potential predictor variables are available, the model is usually fit using stepwise regression analysis. In this case, the computer analysis selects the subset of predic- tor variables that provides the maximum explained variance withn the statistical constraint placed on the data. Other methods are available for fitting the coefficients of the model to data. For example, principal components regression analysis (PCRA) is useful when the pre- dictor variables are highly correlated; PCRA overcomes the problem of irrational coeffi- cients for highly correlated predictor variables. The use of statistical techniques and the in- terpretation of the results are best illustrated using an example. Example 12-1 The area chosen for the analysis was the Upper Sevier River basin above Hatch, in south central Utah (Figure 12-1). The Sevier River above Hatch has a drainage area of 340 mi2 (880.6 krn2). Elevations range from about 6500 ft (1981 m) to 11,000 ft (3353 m), with about 70% of the land area being above 9000 ft (2743 m). Native vegetation above 7000 ft (2133 m) consists primarily of aspen, Ponderosa pine, spruce, and Douglas fir with the most dense stands occurring on the plateaus and mountain slopes with a northern exposure. Vegetation below 7000 ft (2133 m) con- sists primarily of sagebrush, juniper, and scrub oaks. There are a few small diversions and a stor- age reservoir with a capacity of 10,700 acre-ft (1320 m-ha) (Carpenter et al., 1967). The natural streamflow regime consists of low flows from August through March and high snowmelt flows between April and August. The average yearly discharge is about 94,000 acre-ft (11,560 m-ha) with about 75% occurring between April and August. The 1952-1976 baseflow data for the fall months and the flow for April to July and May to July are summarized Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 FIGURE 12-1 Location of Sevier River watershed and data stations. in Table 12-1. The relatively low coefficients of variation for baseflow suggest that there is little yearly variation. The basin has five operating snow courses and three rain gages (Figure 12-1). About 75% of the precipitation occumng during the winter months is in the form of snow. The mean monthly precipitation in April and May is small with a moderate degree of yearly variation (Table 12-1). Snow water equivalent measurements (Table 12-1) vary considerably, with Midway Val- ley having the largest monthly averages and standard deviations. However, the monthly coeffi- cients of variation are smaller than those for the other stations, which indicates that there is more yearly relative stability in the observed values. The monthly distribution of snow water equiva- lent at Midway Valley differs from the distributions at the other four sites since the mean for May is not very different from the mean for April, whereas there is a noticeable difference in the means for April and May for the other four snow stations. These characteristics suggest that the observed values at Midway Valley represent information that is different from the information at the other four sites. Panguitch Lake has the smallest mean snow water equivalent values of the five stations and, while the standard deviations are also small, the relative variation is larger than for any of the other four sites. The monthly distribution of snow water equivalent is characterized by a sig- nificant decrease from April to May. This decrease is probably associated with its compara- tively low elevation; thus, it appears to be somewhat different from the snow regime of Midway Valley. Castle Valley and Duck Creek have similar monthly mean snow water equivalent values. The standard deviations and coefficients of variation for Duck Creek are somewhat larger than those for Castle Valley. This may be indicative of the elevation effect of the two sites. Castle Valley has an elevation quite similar to that of Midway Valley, which was also characterized by comparatively low relative variation. Snow water equivalent measurements at Harris Flat are characterized by large relative variation and a significant decrease in the mean value from April to May. Again, this is probably due to the elevation effect.

Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 Examination of the correlations between the hydrologic variables indicated that the Octo- ber, November, and December baseflow values are significantly correlated among themselves (0.959, 0.780, and 0.775). The correlations between baseflow and both snow water equivalent and precipitation are very small, less than 0.3. The intercorrelations between snow water equiva- lent for the March and April observations are very high (greater than 0.8), while the intercorrela- tions are much less (greater than 0.5) for the May observations; most of the correlations between the precipitation variables and the snow water equivalent variables are less than 0.3 in absolute value. Most of the precipitation variables are moderately correlated with each other. In sum- mary, baseflow, snow water equivalent, and precipitation seem to be statistically independent, while the variables within each subgroup are highly correlated. In general, the correlations he- tween the April-to-July or May-to-July flow and snow water equivalent are quite high (0.672 to 0.855), whereas the correlations between the April-to-July or May-to-July flow and precipitation and baseflow are small (-0.072 to 0.286). Models for the April-to-July water-yield forecast were calibrated using each of the five calibration methods. The models were then compared with each other on the basis of the five cri- teria for model selection. The eight models calibrated are listed in Table 12-2. The correlation coefficient, percent explained variance (R'), standard error of estimate, and the standardized par- tial regression coefficients (shown in parentheses below the partial regression coefficients) are also given in Table 12-2. Multiple regression was used to calibrate models 1 and 2. Model 1 includes only one pre- dictor variable, the April snow water equivalent at Midway Valley, which is the variable most highly correlated with the April-to-July streamflow. Model 2 includes the October baseflow and the April 1 snow water equivalents for all snow courses. Stepwise regression was used to calibrate model 3, which includes the March 1 snow water equivalents at Duck Creek and those for April 1 at Duck Creek and the December baseflow. Model 4 was derived using principal components re- gression analysis, where only two of the six principal components were used. Included as predictor variables were October baseflow and the April 1 snow water equivalents for each of the five snow courses. Model 5 has a polynomial form and was calibrated using principal components analysis. This model uses a single predictor variable (April 1 snow water equivalent at Midway Valley) and powers of it as the predictors instead of a set of predictor variables. Models 6 and 7 were calibrated using the numerical optimization technique known as pattern search. In model 6 the predictor vari- ables include the October baseflow and the April 1 snow water equivalents at all snow courses. The model was formulated so that it included an intercept constant; both the intercept coefficient and coefficient for the April 1 snow water equivalent at Castle Valley were evaluated to be zero by the optimization process. Model 7 resembles model 6 except that baseflow was not included as a predictor variable and the intercept coefficient was allowed to take on negative values. This model is similar to the one presented by Zuzel and Ondrechen (1975) and Zuzel et al. (1975), except the April-to-July streamflow was not converted to area-inches. Model 8, which was calibrated using multiple regression, uses the December baseflow and a weighted sum of the April 1 snow water equivalents for Duck Creek, Harris Flat, and Midway Valley as predictor variables. Weighting of snow water equivalent measurements has the advantage of including measures of water content from different parts of the basin while keeping the statistical degrees of freedom at a maximum. Correlation coefficient and standard error of estimate. The explained variance ( R ~fo)r the eight models range from 0.778 to 0.921, a difference of 0.143 or 14.3%. The stan- dard errors of estimate ranged from 7.62 to 13.74 x lo3 acre-ft (937 to 1690 ha-m). Although these differences are significant, these statistical criteria cannot be used as the sole criteria in dis- tinguishing between models, especially because of the small sample size (length of record) and the irrationality of the coefficients for some models.

Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 Rationality of coefficients. Except for models 5 and 6 (model 6 was constrained not to have a negative intercept), all of the models had a negative intercept that ranged from -27.83 ac-ft for model 8 to -4.07 ac-ft for model 7. The negative intercepts are irrational because they suggest that when values for all the predictor variables are either zero or very small, the flow will be negative. A model with a zero intercept will produce a zero estimate when all the predic- tor variables equal zero. This may not be rational if factors other than the predictor variables that are included in the model affect the system; for example, precipitation and baseflow contribute to the total flow, and thus an intercept equal to zero may not be rational for a model that does not account for these variables. Based on the intercept coefficient the best models would be the pattern-search models (models 6 and 7) or the polynomial (model 5). Besides the intercept coefficients, the partial regression slope coefficients must also be checked for rationality in both magnitude and sign. Because water yield should increase as the snow water equivalent measurements increase, the corresponding partial regression coefficients should be positive. Models 2, 3, and 8 include one or more irrational coefficients. Relative importance. To assess the rationality of the magnitude of a regression coef- ficient, it is necessary to convert it to standardized form. Using the standardized partial regres- sion coefficients as a measure of the relative importance of the corresponding predictor variable, the rationality of the magnitudes can be assessed. Models 6 and 8 have only one large standardized coefficient, which for model 6 corresponds to the variable having the largest predictor- criterion correlation (Midway Valley SWE for April I), with the remaining standardized coeffi- cients being significantly smaller. However, models 2,4, 5, and 7 have more than one coefficient of similar magnitudes. Whether or ncit it is rational to have an equation dominated by a single predictor variable depends on the physical situation. Statistically, if only one predictor variable is dominant, it may be feasible to use a model that uses only that predictor variable. For exam- ple, the goodness-of-fit statistics suggest that model I is not significantly different from model 2, both of which have Midway Valley as the dominant variable. But one must also consider that an equation dominated by just one variable will give poor results if measurements on that one vari- able are in error or not representative of the state of the system. In summary, according to the magnitude and sign of the partial regression coefficients, models 4 and 7 are the best if a single dominant variable is not acceptable. Residuals. Examination of the residuals represent the last criterion for model selec- tion. Because accurate estimates of volumes during years with low streamflow are more critical than years with higher flows, low strearnflows are considered more important in evaluating the residuals. The residuals for the eight models are given in Table 12-3, with the residuals given by year in order of increasing streamflow. All the models except model 7 tended to overpredict for the low values of streamflow and underpredict for the high values of streamflow. Models 1 and 5 had the most reasonable errors for low streamflow, while the other models had similar residuals at low flows.

{"paragraph": "12.5 DEGREE-DAY METHOD Temperature is an important determinant of snowmelt runoff.

This difference is reflected in the equations provided, where the coefficients for open sites are higher than those for forested sites. The implication of this difference is that snowmelt runoff estimation models must account for the type of land cover, as neglecting this factor could lead to significant errors in estimating melt rates and subsequent runoff volumes.

Additionally, the representativeness of the calibration data is critical, as the accuracy of the estimates depends on how well the calibration conditions reflect the actual snowmelt conditions. These limitations can be addressed by incorporating additional data, such as precipitation and wind speed, into the models and by ensuring that the calibration data are representative of the range of conditions under which snowmelt occurs.

{"paragraph": "12.7.1 The Martinec Model The Martinec Model (1975) is an example of a simple, short-duration forecast model. It has the following simple form: in which C is the runoff coefficient, A the watershed area, a the degree-day factor, T the number of degree-days for the forecast period, S the fraction of the snow-covered area, P the precipitation contributing to runoff, k the recession coefficient, and Q,,, and Q,, the average + daily discharges for forecast period (n 1) and n, respectively. Before discussing the input to the model, it is worthwhile examining the structure of the model. The second term in the model is a term that reflects the autocorrelation between flows in adjacent time periods. On this basis, k would be an autoregression coefficient. For large watersheds one would expect greater autocorrelation between flows in adjacent forecast periods, and in such cases, the sec- ond term would have greater significance. For small watersheds and short forecast durations, flows are more sensitive to the daily fluctuations in meteorological conditions, and therefore the autocorrelation term becomes less significant. As the autoregression coefficient k be- comes smaller, the factor (1 - k) increases and the first term on the right side of Equation 12-1 1 becomes more significant. In summary, the second term on the right side of Equation 12-1 1 represents the degree to which flows in adjacent forecast periods are similar, and the value of k reflects the importance of the autoregressive nature of the flows relative to the im- portance of the meteorological inputs during the forecast period.

However, to apply the model it is necessary to provide values for both the input variables A, T, S, P, and Q, and the empirical coefficients C, a, and k. Martinec (1975) provided fitted values of the degree- day factor, which reflects the amount of snow that melts for each degree-day. Values are typ- ically in the range from 0.35 to 0.60 cm per degree(Ce1sius)-day. The variation reflects varia- tion in factors that affect the rate of snowmelt, including the available energy, the state of the snowpack, and meteorological factors. Thus the value of a will vary on a day-to-day basis, with an obvious systematic variation over the course of a snowmelt season. The value will also vary with the elevation, and for a watershed that is divided into zones, different values may have to be fit for each elevation zone.

This variation with elevation reflects the changes in climate, snowpack conditions, and energy availability that occur at different elevations, which in turn influence the rate of snowmelt."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt modeling, why is the degree-day factor, as represented by 'a', significant?", "answer": "The degree-day factor 'a' is significant in snowmelt modeling because it reflects the amount of snow that melts for each degree-day, which is crucial for predicting the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. The value of 'a' typically ranges from 0.35 to 0.60 cm per degree(Celsius)-day, and its variation captures the effects of various factors such as available energy, snowpack state, and meteorological conditions on the snowmelt process. Understanding and accurately estimating 'a' is essential for reliable snowmelt predictions and subsequent hydrological modeling."}, {"question": "What implications does the structural interdependence of coefficients C, a, and k have for the application and calibration of the Martinec Model?", "answer": "The structural interdependence of coefficients C, a, and k implies that the application and calibration of the Martinec Model require careful consideration of how changes in one coefficient affect the others. This interdependence complicates the calibration process, as it necessitates an iterative approach to estimate the coefficients accurately. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understanding the physical processes represented by these coefficients and how they interact within the model. The interdependence also suggests that model performance could be sensitive to the initial assumptions and the quality of the input data, underscoring the need for robust calibration datasets and careful model evaluation."}, {"question": "How does the iterative process for estimating coefficients C and k contribute to the overall accuracy of the Martinec Model?", "answer": "The iterative process for estimating coefficients C and k contributes significantly to the overall accuracy of the Martinec Model by allowing for the refinement of these critical parameters.

{"paragraph": "12.8 SNOWMELT RECESSION ESTIMATION While runoff volumes for periods of 30 days or more are often the primary variables used in water resources management of snowmelt runoff supplies, many models use physically based models that involve moisture accounting on a daily basis. For such models an under- standing and representation of the snowmelt process is important. While data bases used for these models may consist of daily totals or daily means, it is recognized that melt and runoff rates are not constant over a 24 hr period. The daily fluctuations in temperature are reflected in the snowmelt runoff hydrograph, with the runoff rates lagging the changes in temperature. Figure 12-2 shows a snowmelt runoff hydrograph for a 4-day period. The schematic shows that all of the water that melts on a given day does not appear as runoff on that day; in fact, the melt can appear over a period of many days, just as baseflow from runoff that results from rain can occur over an extended period of time. Figure 12-2 also suggests that the water in the snowmelt recession can represent a significant part of the total runoff. --u Sec. 12.8 Snowmelt Trecession Estimation FIGURE 12-2 Continuous snowmelt hydrograph showing contribution from Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 snowm~ el - t recessions. For short-term modeling of snowmelt runoff, the accuracy of estimated runoff rates can be enhanced by including a model component that represents the effect of recession runoff. A number of models have been proposed. Barnes (1939) proposed a decay function having the form Qt = Qop (12-14) in which Q, is the initial runoff rate of the recession on day t = 0, t is the number of days since the start of the recession, Q, is the recession runoff rate on day t, and K is the daily runoff recession coefficient. A least squares-estimate of K can be obtained using Equation 2-100, with t equal to 1 and values of Q, and Q, selected from recessions of measured snowmelt streamflow. Equation 12-14 can also be stated as The parameters k and K are related by Other functional forms can also be used to represent the recession, such as the simple power model: Q,,, = aQ; Equation 12-17 has the advantage that the coefficients are easily computed using readily available computer software for least squares. Example 12-6 The calibration of a recession model can be demonstrated using data from the Conejos River. Table 12-8 provides the daily mean streamflow for the period from April 1, 1976, to September 30, 1976. For this illustration, recessions were defined as periods of 4 or more days during which Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 TABLE 12-8 Measured Streamflow (ft3/sec), Conejos River, near Magote, Colorado, for 1976 Day April May June July August September the runoff rate did not increase.

These models require a detailed understanding of how snowmelt contributes to runoff, including the timing and volume of meltwater. This knowledge helps in predicting runoff volumes and managing water supplies effectively."}, {"question": "How do daily fluctuations in temperature affect snowmelt runoff rates?", "answer": "Daily fluctuations in temperature are reflected in the snowmelt runoff hydrograph, with runoff rates lagging behind changes in temperature. This indicates that temperature changes directly influence the rate at which snow melts and subsequently affects the runoff. The lag in runoff rates suggests that the impact of temperature on snowmelt is not immediate but rather delayed, which is a critical factor in modeling snowmelt runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt recession estimation, what is the purpose of including a model component that represents the effect of recession runoff?", "answer": "The purpose of including a model component that represents the effect of recession runoff is to enhance the accuracy of estimated runoff rates for short-term modeling of snowmelt runoff. By accounting for the recession runoff, models can better capture the dynamics of snowmelt hydrographs, where the water that melts on a given day may not appear as runoff on that day but rather over a period of many days. This is crucial for predicting water availability and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "Why are models like the decay function proposed by Barnes (1939) used in snowmelt recession estimation?", "answer": "Models like the decay function proposed by Barnes (1939) are used because they provide a mathematical representation of how recession runoff rates change over time. The decay function, Qt = Qo * e^(-Kt), allows for the estimation of the daily runoff recession coefficient (K), which is essential for predicting the rate at which runoff decreases during a recession period. This information is vital for water resources management, as it helps in understanding how long it takes for the runoff to decrease to a certain level, thereby informing decisions on water allocation and management."}, {"question": "How does the simple power model (Q(t) = aQo^t) compare to the decay function in terms of computational complexity and applicability?", "answer": "The simple power model is computationally less complex and more straightforward to apply than the decay function because its coefficients can be easily computed using readily available computer software for least squares. This simplicity makes the power model more accessible and easier to implement in practice, especially when compared to the decay function, which requires the estimation of the daily runoff recession coefficient (K). However, the choice between these models should be based on their performance in capturing the actual recession dynamics of the specific snowmelt runoff being studied."}, {"question": "In the context of calibrating a recession model, how are recessions typically defined, and what data are used for calibration?", "answer": "Recessions are typically defined as periods of 4 or more days during which the runoff rate does not increase. For calibration, data such as daily mean streamflow over an extended period are used. These data provide the necessary information to estimate the parameters of the recession model, such as the coefficients in the simple power model or the decay function. The calibration process involves selecting values of Qo and Qt from the measured streamflow data and using them to solve for the model parameters, which are then used to predict future runoff rates during recession periods."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to accurately model snowmelt runoff, and what implications does this have for water resources management?", "answer": "Accurately modeling snowmelt runoff is challenging due to the complex interactions between snowmelt, runoff, and the underlying hydrological processes. The lag between snowmelt and runoff, the variability in daily temperature fluctuations, and the need to account for recession runoff all contribute to this complexity. The implications of these challenges for water resources management are significant, as inaccurate predictions can lead to mismanagement of water supplies, affecting both the environment and human activities that depend on these resources. Therefore, continuous improvement in modeling techniques and the incorporation of detailed hydrological processes are essential for enhancing the accuracy of snowmelt runoff predictions and supporting effective water resources management."}, {"question": "How does the representation of snowmelt recession in models impact the prediction of total runoff volumes?", "answer": "The representation of snowmelt recession in models significantly impacts the prediction of total runoff volumes because the water in the snowmelt recession can represent a significant part of the total runoff. Accurate modeling of the recession phase is crucial for capturing the extended period over which meltwater contributes to runoff. If the recession is not well-represented, the model may underestimate or overestimate the total runoff volume, leading to potential errors in water resources planning and management.

{"paragraph": "12.9 WATER BALANCE MODELS Water balance models are formulated with a simple structure to reflect causality of the physi- cal factors that control the melt process and runoff. The simple structure is accompanied by a reduction in the data requirements and serves to simplify the calibration. The intent behind water balance models is to account for all water entering and leaving the basin. The volume Sec. 12.9 Water Balance Models Discharge (ft3Isec) for Day t (Qt) FIGURE 12-3 Recession model for the Conejos River watershed (April 1, 1976, to Septem- ber 30, 1976). of water stored in the snowpack is represented through input requirements such as total pre- cipitation volumes for long time periods or snow water equivalent measurements. Some models may make allowances for losses due to evaporation, transpiration, and ground water storage. For some models, loss rates are used to reflect the losses, with no regard for the spe- cific processes governing losses. Tangborn (1978) formulated a model that can be considered as a water balance model. The model relates the seasonal snowmelt runoff Q, to the measured winter precipitation P, and winter runoff Q,, by Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 in which a and b are fitting coefficients. The coefficients a and b can be fit using least squares because Q , i s not associated directly with a coefficient; however, Equations 2-56 cannot be used directly. Instead, the model of Equation 12-19 must be inserted into Equation 2-52 and the equations for estimating a and b derived, which are as follows: and in which - Q, , - Q,, and P, are the means of Q,, Q,, and P,,, respectively. To calibrate Equation 12-19 it is necessary to have values of Q,, Q,, and P,, for n years of record. Equation 12-19 + should not be calibrated by subtracting Q, from Q, and regressing the difference (Q, Q,) + on P, because then the values of a and b relate (Q, Q,) to P,, and the computed correla- tion coefficient would reflect the accuracy in estimates of (Q, + Q,,,) but not Q,. Example 12-7 The data of Table 12-9 shows the winter precipitation (P,,), winter runoff (Q,), and seasonal snow- melt runoff Q, (all in in.) for a record of 9 years. The summations of Equation 12-20 are given in Table 12-9 and were used to compute the model coefficients with Equations 12-20 and 12-21: Equation 12-22 was used to regenerate the values of Q, for the 9 years of record and the errors (ej) computed (see Table 12-9). The sum of the errors equals zero, which indicates that the model is unbiased. Equation 2-64 cannot be used to compute the correlation coefficient for Equation 12-22, so the accuracy of Equation 12-22 was assessed by computing the standard error of estimate with the sum of the squares of the errors; Equation 2-65 yields a S, of 2.63 in., which can be compared with the standard error of the Q, values, which was 4.38 in. Thus the ex- pected error was reduced by 40%. TABLE 12-9 Example 12-7: Water Balance Model JW' Qu QJ QT e Year (in.) (in.) (in.) (in.)

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to malung technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1. What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. Water Yield and Snowmelt Runoff Chap. 12 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, rs- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. A hydrologist obtains a commercially marketed piece of software that adver- tisements indicate will provide snowmelt runoff predictions given measurements of snow water equivalent values and daily temperature values, which is the data that the hydrologist has available for a particular project. The hydrologist has experience in rainfall-runoff esti- mation, but does not have practical experience in snow hydrology. No one else in the hydrol- ogist's company has any experience in snow hydrology. The software comes with a brief manual that describes how to use the program, but it lacks any discussion of the mathemati- cal model that transforms the input into snowmelt runoff estimates. The hydrologist applies the software and uses the computed runoff in the design. Water Quality CHAPTER OBJECTIVES 1. Discuss concentration and load estimation at ungaged locations. 2.

This simplification is particularly useful when detailed data are scarce or when the model is intended for general application across various watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of the Martinec Model, what is the role of the recession coefficient, and how does it relate to snowpack depletion?", "answer": "The recession coefficient in the Martinec Model indicates the rate at which the snowpack is depleted. It reflects how quickly the snowmelt runoff decreases over time, influenced by factors such as temperature, snow-covered area, and precipitation. Understanding the recession coefficient is crucial for accurately predicting snowmelt runoff volumes and timing, as it directly affects the model's ability to simulate the dynamic nature of snowpack depletion and runoff generation."}, {"question": "How do empirical snowmelt runoff models, such as the one formulated by Tangborn, estimate seasonal snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "Empirical snowmelt runoff models, like the one formulated by Tangborn, estimate seasonal snowmelt runoff by relating the runoff to measured winter precipitation and winter runoff through fitting coefficients. These coefficients are calibrated using historical data, allowing the model to predict future runoff based on precipitation and initial runoff conditions. The model's simplicity and reliance on observable data make it practical for application in various hydrological settings."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a water balance model that does not account for losses due to evaporation, transpiration, and groundwater storage?", "answer": "Using a water balance model that does not account for losses due to evaporation, transpiration, and groundwater storage can lead to inaccurate predictions of snowmelt runoff. These losses can significantly affect the actual volume of water available for runoff, especially in watersheds with high evapotranspiration rates or substantial groundwater recharge. Neglecting these processes can result in overestimation of runoff volumes, potentially leading to poor water resource management decisions."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt runoff estimation, why is it important to consider the fraction of snow-covered area and its impact on runoff?", "answer": "Considering the fraction of snow-covered area is crucial in snowmelt runoff estimation because it directly influences the amount of snow available for melting and, consequently, the runoff volume. The snow-covered area affects the energy balance and melt rates, with larger snow-covered areas generally resulting in higher runoff volumes. Accurately accounting for changes in snow cover is essential for reliable snowmelt runoff predictions, especially in watersheds with variable snow cover distribution."}, {"question": "How does the degree-day method estimate snowmelt runoff, and what are its limitations?", "answer": "The degree-day method estimates snowmelt runoff by correlating melt rates with air temperature, using the concept of degree-days. This method is straightforward and requires minimal data but has limitations, including its simplicity and lack of consideration for other factors influencing snowmelt, such as radiation, wind, and snowpack properties. Its application is generally limited to regions with well-established temperature-melt relationships and may not perform well in areas with complex snowmelt dynamics."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the recession curve in snowmelt runoff modeling, and how is it derived?", "answer": "The recession curve in snowmelt runoff modeling represents the decrease in runoff over time after the peak melt period. It is derived by analyzing the runoff data during recession periods, typically defined as periods of four or more days without an increase in runoff rate. The recession curve is essential for understanding the runoff response of a watershed and for predicting future runoff volumes, as it reflects the combined effects of snowpack depletion, groundwater storage, and evapotranspiration on the runoff hydrograph."}, {"question": "In the context of water balance modeling, what are the challenges associated with calibrating models using limited historical data?", "answer": "Calibrating water balance models with limited historical data poses significant challenges, including uncertainty in model parameters, potential overfitting, and reduced predictive capability.

Understanding these factors is essential for managing water quality, as low dissolved oxygen levels can lead to harmful conditions for aquatic ecosystems."}, {"question": "In the context of runoff generation, why is the distinction between \"Q\" (discharge rate) and \"Qi\" (flow rate in) important, and how do they relate to each other?", "answer": "The distinction between \"Q\" (discharge rate) and \"Qi\" (flow rate in) is important because they represent different aspects of water flow. \"Q\" refers to the overall rate at which water is discharged from a system, while \"Qi\" specifically denotes the flow rate entering the system. These two rates are related in that the inflow (Qi) contributes to the overall discharge (Q), but they can differ due to factors like storage (S) and losses within the system."}, {"question": "What is the role of the rate coefficient \"k\" in the context of water quality modeling, and how does it vary with temperature?", "answer": "The rate coefficient \"k\" plays a critical role in water quality modeling as it represents the rate at which certain processes, such as deoxygenation or reoxygenation, occur. The value of \"k\" can vary with temperature, as indicated by \"k20\" being the value of \"k\" at 20°C, suggesting that temperature affects the rate of these processes. This temperature dependence is crucial for accurately modeling water quality under different environmental conditions."}, {"question": "How does the percentage of impervious land cover (I,) affect runoff generation, and what implications does this have for urban hydrology?", "answer": "The percentage of impervious land cover (I,) significantly affects runoff generation by reducing the amount of land available for infiltration, thus increasing the volume of runoff. This has significant implications for urban hydrology, as increased imperviousness can lead to higher peak flow rates, increased risk of flooding, and decreased groundwater recharge. Managing impervious cover is therefore a key consideration in urban planning to mitigate these effects."}, {"question": "In the context of water pollution, what is the difference between \"Lo\" (initial BOD) and \"Lo\" (ultimate demand), and why are these distinctions important?", "answer": "\"Lo\" can refer to either the initial BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) or the ultimate demand, which are distinct concepts in water pollution. Initial BOD measures the amount of oxygen demanded by microorganisms to break down organic matter at the start, while ultimate demand refers to the total amount of oxygen required for complete degradation.

The solutions to some engineering problems require models that use a time-dependent variable such as discharge as a predictor variable. The use of concentration-flow or load- flow relationships are examples. First, the time-dependent change in the dissolved oxygen concentration in a stream is a problem common in stream analysis. Second, a relationship be- tween the pollutant concentration and time is called a pollutograph; a load-time relationship is similarly called a loadograph.

{"paragraph": "13.2.1 Water Quality Measurements Where water quality information is important in the decision-making process, the engineer may find it necessary to obtain data in the form of actual measurements of water quality levels or regional information based on measured data. Water quality measurements are not readily available. Local, state, and national agencies now collect water quality data, but the records are often short and the measurements taken irregularly. The first step in assembling a water quality data base is to contact agencies who regularly collect such data, and talk with local planning offices who may have used such data in the past. The United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) collects water quality data and regularly publishes the re- sults. Figure 13-1 shows an example of a water quality report published by the Geological Survey. Different types of engineering projects require information about different con- stituents. Nitrogen and phosphorus data are important in areas where agricultural runoff is significant and the control of eutrophication is desirable; these constituents act as nutrients for unwanted biological and vegetative growth in streams. Suspended solids can be a signifi- cant pollutant in urban areas where construction activity is talung place. In addition to in- creasing the sediment flux, suspended solids also increase the turbidity of a stream, which can be detrimental to aquatic life, and they can increase the cost of purifying water for public water supplies. Table 13-1 lists the wide array of water quality constituents that are associ- ated with highway runoff. Heavy metals, such as zinc, are a major public health considera- tion. Where water quality measurements are not available, but projections of water quality are needed, it may be necessary to use regionalized values. These are often mean values based on measurements collected within the region. Mean values are usually given for differ- ent land use conditions. Where regional data are adequate, prediction equations may have been developed. Prediction equations based on nationwide data are also available for some constituents. On-site measurements would be expected to provide the most accurate esti- mates followed by regional and national data. Accuracy assessments should be made of all projections and reported with the projections.

{"paragraph": "13.2.2 Definitions It is important to distinguish between the concentration and the load or flux of a water qual- ity constituent. Concentration (C)h as dimensions of mass per unit volume. The load (W) of a constituent has dimensions of weight per unit of time.

If W [=I gtsec, Q [=I m3/sec, and C [=I mg/L (or g/m3),t hen K, = 1. If W [=I lblday, Q [=I ft3/sec, and C [=I mg/L, then K, = 5.39. While the variables of Equation 13-1 are shown as single values, it is important to rec- ognize that water quality constituents vary in both time and space. Many constituents show significant diurnal and seasonal variations. As material flows downstream, a portion of the load may settle andlor undergo biological or chemical transformation; thus, a significant spa- tial trend may be evident along the stream. Equation 13-1 is sometimes written as W (x; t) = K,C (x; t) Q (x; t) This form indicates that the load, concentration, and discharge show temporal and spatial variation. Water quality data are most often measured and reported as a concentration. For many decisions, values expressed as a concentration are the appropriate form. When contaminated water is withdrawn from a stream, the concentration of various constituents is measured and 690 Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 used to determine the appropriate level of clean-up. When considering the effect of a con- stituent on aquatic life, the concentration and duration are the appropriate form for presenting the data. Measurements of nonconservative water quality constituents are presented in concen- tration form, rather than as a load. Conservative pollutants that can settle out and accumulate in the environment are most often expressed as a load. The long-term mass of the pollutant would then be used to assess the importance of action to clean-up the material. For example, suspended solids that enter a reservoir or small retention pond can settle to the bottom and rep resent a long-term loss of storage. If other water quality constituents are attached to the solids, then they can also accumulate in the sediment. In fact, up to half of the nitrogen input entering lakes has been reported to be associated with the particles, and hence, settled in the sediment.

In the case of the Susquehanna River, the power model form did not provide a good fit to the data, with a bias of -0.81 mg/L and a standard error of estimate of 5.29 mg/L. This suggests that the relationship between concentration and flow rate is not always straightforward and can be influenced by other factors."}, {"question": "In what context are empirical formulas used to predict loads or concentrations in hydrology, and what are their limitations?", "answer": "Empirical formulas are used to predict loads or concentrations in hydrology, particularly in the context of storm events or intermittent flows.

In the case of the Susquehanna River, the adjusted correlation coefficient (R' = 0.187) indicates a poor fit of the power model form to the data, suggesting that the relationship between concentration and flow rate is complex and may not be well-represented by the model."}, {"question": "In the context of water quality estimation, why is it important to consider the concentration-flow relationship when predicting contaminant loads?", "answer": "Considering the concentration-flow relationship is crucial when predicting contaminant loads because it allows for the estimation of the load based on the concentration and flow rate. This is important because contaminant loads can vary significantly depending on the flow rate, and ignoring this relationship can lead to inaccurate predictions. By using the concentration-flow relationship, water quality models can provide more accurate estimates of contaminant loads and inform management decisions."}, {"question": "How do the exponents in the regression relationships for water quality parameters and discharge rate Q indicate the nature of the relationships?", "answer": "The exponents in the regression relationships indicate the nature of the relationships between the water quality parameters and discharge rate Q.

This implies that small changes in discharge rate Q can result in significant changes in the water quality parameters."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the limited applicability of empirical formulas and regression relationships for water quality prediction and management?", "answer": "The limited applicability of empirical formulas and regression relationships for water quality prediction and management implies that site-specific data collection and model development are necessary to accurately predict contaminant loads and inform management decisions. This can be resource-intensive and may limit the widespread application of these models. However, the use of these models can still provide valuable insights into the relationships between water quality parameters and discharge rate Q, and can inform management decisions at the local scale."}, {"question": "In the context of concentration-flow relationships, how can the power model form be used to estimate contaminant loads?", "answer": "The power model form can be used to estimate contaminant loads by first determining the concentration of the contaminant using the equation C = aQ^b, and then using the estimated concentration and flow"}]}
{"paragraph": "13.2.4 Frequency Analysis Frequency analyses are widely used to analyze rainfall data in developing intensity-duration- frequency curves (Chapter 4), to characterize the random nature of flood data (Chapter 5), and to provide the discharges necessary to fit regional peak discharge equations (Chapter 7). While frequency analyses could provide useful information for water quality planning, the necessary input data are rarely available. If the interest was annual maximum concentrations, it is unlikely that the random sampling programs that exist would produce the annual maxi- mum. Thus, using the measured maximum for each year would probably produce a fre- quency curve that would underestimate the annual maximum, with the underprediction pos- sibly being very significant. Where accumulation of a constituent over a period of time is important for planning, annual loads become the random variable of interest. If probability estimates of annual loads were needed and both continuous records of streamflow and se- lected measurements of the constituent were available, the selected measurements could be used to fit a concentration-flow relationship, which would then be used with the streamflow to estimate annual loads. The procedure is as follows: 1. Using measured concentrations from a random sampling program, fit the concentra- tion-flow relationship of Equation 13-3 using the concentrations and the correspond- ing discharge measurements. 2. Using the concentration-flow relationship and the continuous streamflow relationship, estimate the concentration for all discharges and convert these to loads using Equa- tion 13-1. 3. Compute the annual load by integrating the computed loads. 4. Perform a frequency analysis on the annual loads. Of course, the accuracy of annual loads estimated from the resulting frequency curve will depend, in part, on the accuracy of the concentration-flow relationship.

This analysis helps in understanding the variability and likelihood of different load levels, thereby informing water quality management strategies."}, {"question": "How does the accuracy of the concentration-flow relationship impact the estimation of annual loads?", "answer": "The accuracy of the concentration-flow relationship significantly impacts the estimation of annual loads. A more accurate concentration-flow relationship leads to more reliable estimates of concentrations for different discharges, which in turn result in more accurate annual load estimates. Conversely, inaccuracies in the concentration-flow relationship can lead to underestimation or overestimation of annual loads, affecting the reliability of water quality planning decisions."}, {"question": "In the context of water quality planning, what is the role of continuous streamflow data in estimating annual loads?", "answer": "Continuous streamflow data play a critical role in estimating annual loads by providing the necessary discharge information to estimate concentrations using the concentration-flow relationship.

{"paragraph": "13.2.6 Mean Weighted Load Sampling programs often collect multiple samples per storm event from which estimates are (q) made of the event mean load or event mean concentration.

By weighting the loads by the runoff volumes, the estimation accounts for the varying amounts of water that contribute to the load, rather than simply averaging the loads.

{"paragraph": "13.3.1 Nationwide Equations for Urban Watersheds Where site-specific or local data are not available to estimate water quality concentrations, it may be necessary to use regional or nationwide equations. If the conditions for which esti- mates are required are similar to those for which the nationwide equations were developed, then they may yield reasonably accurate predictions. Nationwide equations often require more detailed input than just land use activity, such as the mean concentrations of Tables 13-5 and 13-6. Urban areas are of special concern with respect to water quality. While the area of a city might be small compared with the area of agricultural lands, urban areas produce high concentrations of pollutants per unit area and they lack the natural buffering that often exists in agricultural areas. Urban planners, therefore, need estimates of loads from urban drainage basins. Driver and Tasker (1988) provided nationwide equations that can be used to estimate the mean loads of a storm for ten constituents (see Table 13-1 1). The regression coefficients given in Table 13-1 1 are for the model ? = bc10 ** [bo + bl A ** 0.5 + b2I , + b3P, + b4Ti + b5 I,] f in which is the predicted value of the constituent; b, is a bias correction factor; A is the total contributing drainage area (sq. mi); I, is the impervious land cover as a percentage of the total area (%); Pa is the mean annual rainfall (in.); Tj is the mean minimum January tem- perature and I, is an indicator variable of commercial and industrial land cover exceed- (OF); ing (I, = 1) or not exceeding (I, = 0) 75% of the drainage area. The annual load can be esti- f mated by multiplying of Equation 13-1 1 by the mean number of runoff-producing storms in a year. Table 13-8 gives values for selected U.S. cities. Equation 13-1 1 was developed using measured data for drainage areas in the range from approximately 0.02 to 0.8 sq. mi.

{"paragraph": "13.3.3 The Simple Method Schueler (1987) developed a method for estimating pollutant loads for urban areas. The method is based on data from the National Urban Runoff Program. It is intended to be used for time periods ranging from a single storm event to mean annual rates and for areas less than a square mile. The structure of the method known as the \"Simple Method\" is similar to that of the Rational Formula for estimating peak discharges; it combines the discharge com- puted in a manner similar to the Rational Method with the relationship of Equation 13-1. Specifically, the load L (lbs) is computed by in which P is the rainfall depth (in.) for the time interval for which L is needed, P, is a factor that corrects P for storms that do not produce runoff, R, is the fraction of rainfall that is con- verted to runoff, A is the area of the development site (acres), and C is the flow-weighted mean concentration (mg/L) of the pollutant. Equation 13-16 has the form of Equation 13-1 Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 if the product PP,R,A corresponds to the discharge. This similarity should be evident in that R, would correspond to the runoff coefficient of the Rational Method and PP, to the inten- sity. Given that the Rational Formula is widely used and accepted, the Simple Method is ap- propriate for its intended use. The value of P in Equation 13-16 can be the total depth for a storm event or a value as large as the annual rainfall. The duration of the value of P will determine the duration of the computed load. If the annual rainfall is used in Equation 13-16, then the computed load is in pounds per year. The correction factor P, is the most difficult of the five inputs. For an indi- vidual storm, P, equals one. When computing an annual load, the value of P, may be less than 0.5 depending on the location. P, is the proportion of storms during the duration speci- fied for P that produce measurable runoff. Schueler provides the following relationship for estimating R,: in which I is the watershed imperviousness (%). The mean pollutant concentration ,can be obtained from either local data or averages from other studies. Mean values from different locations can be quite variable, and consider- able judgment is necessary in selecting a value. Schueler provided the values shown in Table 13-13 for urban areas.

{"paragraph": "13.4.1 Batch Reactors For a water quality constituent, the conservation of mass of Equation 13-19 can be rewritten as in which V is the volume and r is the mass rate of decay. For a batch reactor Qi= Q, = 0. As- suming decay, rather than production, Equation 13-20 reduces to Assuming the rate of decay follows the first-order reaction, or r = KC, Equation 13-21 yields in which K is the reaction rate coefficient, with a unit of time.' (that is, per day). Based on this assumed form, the concentration at any time t is Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 in which Co is the initial concentration. Equation 13-23 is commonly used for expressing the temporal decay of a substance. In practice, it is used to estimate the concentration C at time t, which requires a value of the rate coefficient K. Such use represents synthesis. The value of K is often obtained from a table of values. However, for a particular case, it may be necessary to have a site-specific value of K. Thus, it would be necessary to analyze measured data. Two measurements of the concentra- tion would be needed. The initial concentration at an assumed time of 0 is denoted as C,. A second measurement at time t yields C. Rearranging Equation 13-23 and making a logarith- mic transform yields which uses the concentration at time t and the value of C. C, Co, and t are then used to com- pute K, which can then be used for synthesis at the location and for the conditions at which the measurements were made. While two measured values and the time interval between measurements can be used, it is more common to collect a series of values and perform a regression analysis of concen- tration on time. For such an analysis, a logarithmic transformation of Equation 13-23 is made: In C = In Co - Kt in which y = log C and a = In C,. The coefficients a and b are fitted with measurements, with the resulting values used to quantify K = b and C, = ea. Since measured values may contain a significant amount of error, the use of two points may yield inaccurate values of the coefficients Co and K. The regression approach with sev- eral measurements is preferable. Example 13-8 A stream with a flow velocity of 5 fps has an initial coliform number of 1001100mL. The col- iform level measured 20 mi downstream is 501100 mL.

{"paragraph": "13.5 FLOW DILUTION Equations 13-1 and 13-2 apply to a single flow path in a system. It is frequently necessary to combine or separate flows at junctions within the system. For example, storm runoff systems originating in two parts of a watershed may combine to form a main pipe, and the flow rates and loadings within the two-pipe segments may be quite different. A similar case arises when two streams join to form a larger strew. In both instances, it is necessary to compute the concentration of pollutants in the combined flow. In solving such problems, these two points must be considered: 1. At a junction, the flow into the junction must equal the flow out of the junction. 2. The load into the junction must equal the load out of the junction. These concepts assume that storage in the junction is not possible. These concepts are ex- pressed mathematically by As an example, consider the case where two streams join to form a third stream. Then Equation 13-29 becomes and Equation 13-30 becomes Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 To find the concentration in the main stream, Equation 13-1 is used with Equation 13-32: Solving for the unknown C3 and using Equation 13-3 1 yields Equation 13-34 assumes that the flow from the two inputs completely mix. This may or may not happen. It depends on the nature of the flow and the characteristics of the water quality constituents. It is not uncommon to see aerial photographs of the confluence of two rivers, one reasonably free of sediment and the other sediment laden. The photo shows that the two streams have not mixed. Conversely, one would expect the flows from two I-ft di- ameter pipes from different parts of a watershed to mix very quickly. Thus, the assumption of complete mixing, which underlies Equation 13-34, would be valid. Example 13-10 A cannery has a daily production rate of 600 cases of green beans. Records indicate that this pro- duction requires 100 gallons of water per case, or 0.06 mgd (that is, million gallons per day). The effluent has a BOD concentration of 95 mgL and a suspended solids concentrations of 290 mgL. The untreated waste water is discharged into a local stream, where regulations limit BOD and suspended solids concentrations to 20 mgL and 100 mgL, respectively. During a drought, flow in the stream decreases to 5 ft3/sec. The local water agency is charged with determining whether or not the limits specified in the regulations are being ex- ceeded in the cannery effluent. Measurements at a station upstream indicate BOD and SS con- centrations of 2 and 15 mg/L, respectively. The discharge of 0.06 mgd is equivalent to 0.09283 ft3/sec. Following Equation 13-34, the concentration of BOD in the stream (C,,) below the discharge point from the cannery is For the suspended solids, the downstream concentration of the total flow is Thus, the BOD and the concentration of the suspended solids are below the limits. Equation 13-34 can also be used to determine the upstream flow rate that is necessary to provide sufficient dilution such that the BOD limit will not be exceeded. Letting Q, and Q, rep- resent the upstream and downstream flow rates and C, be the regulatory limit, then in which Q, is the total flow and equals Q, plus Q,. Solving for the upstream flow gives Sec. 13.5 Flow Dilution 709 Thus, when the flow rate upstream falls below 0.39 ft3/sec with a BOD concentration of 2 mg/L, the combined flow will not meet the limit of 2 mg/L for the BOD concentration. Example 13-11 Concentrations of lead in storm runoff from residential areas can be significant. Standards for drinking water recommend a limit of 0.05 mg/L; a limit of 0.1 mg/L is recommended for fresh- water aquatic life. Short-term occurrences above the limit may not be detrimental to aquatic life. In a particular urban area with a drainage area of 200 acres, measurements of the concen- tration of lead in storm runoff average 0.35 mg/L. Assume the average discharge is 200 cfs dur- ing the storm. The surface runoff is discharged into a stream with a normal flow of 25 cfs and lead concentrations of 0.002 mg/L. The concentration of the lead in the combined flow is While this is well above the recommended limit, the storm duration is relatively short. However, such high concentrations can cause localized problems if the polluted runoff is allowed to accu- mulate in ponded areas. Example 13-12 Equation 13-34 can-be used to compute the ordinates of a pollutograph from ordinates at the confluence of two streams or pipes. Table 13-14 gives the instantaneous flow rates and corre- sponding concentrations of total organic nitrogen for two urban drainage basins having areas of 17 acres and 22 acres. The collector pipes intersect and flow to a storm main. For the measure- ments at time 1255, the concentration in the main is Values for the remaining ordinates of the main-drain pollutographs are given in Table 13-14.

{"paragraph": "13.6 STREETER-PHELPS OXYGEN SAG CURVE The discharge of biologically degradable substances into a water body creates a demand for oxygen. The demand varies with time, and if it is a moving stream, the demand will change as the substances move downstream. The demand for oxygen created by these substances is called the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and the consumption of the oxygen that exists in the stream is called deoxygenation. At the same time that the decomposable substances are causing the dissolved oxygen to be depleted, oxygen is being transferred from the atmosphere and is being released by plants through photosynthetic activity; these processes are called re- oxygenation, or reaeration. The time-dependent relationship that shows the effects of oxygen depletion and resupply is called the oxygen sag curve, which is usually shown as a graph of the oxygen concentration versus time. Where the biologically decomposable substances are dumped into a moving body of water, such as a stream, the time axis is related to the distance downstream from the discharge point through the velocity of the stream. The rate of deoxy- genation by the load in the water body is generally viewed as two activities: the breakdown of carbonaceous matter, which is called the first-stage BOD, and the breakdown of nitrogenous substances, which is called nitrification. Only the first-stage BOD will be considered here. The commonly used representation of the deoxygenation of a stream is based on the following assumptions: (1) BOD is independent of the oxygen-concentration; (2) BOD is de- pendent on the concentration of biologically decomposable material; and (3) the oxygen con- centration is greater than the critical value, which is temperature dependent. If we assume that the rate of deoxygenation is proportional to the amount of carbonaceous waste (L,) avail- able at time t, then in which k, is the rate constant for deoxygenation. The differential equation is easily solved: in which Lo is the ultimate demand. The rate constant is temperature dependent, and the value of k, at any temperature T (\"C) can be found by in which ko is the rate constant at 2 0 ' ~an d 0 is the temperature coefficient, usually taken as 1.047. The oxygen demand at any time t, L,, equals the difference between the ultimate de- mand Lo and the oxygen consumed by the wastes between the time the load entered the stream and time t: Solving Equation 13-44 for D, and substituting Equation 13-42 for L, yields D, = Lo(l - e-ht) The rate of reoxygenation is proportional to the deficit: Sec. 13.6 Streeter-Phelps Oxygen Sag Curve 71 1 in which D = C, - C, C, is the saturated dissolved oxygen, and C is the observed dissolved oxygen. k2 is the rate constant for reoxygenation, which is temperature dependent and is usu- ally assumed to follow the van't Hoff-Arrhenius Equation: in which C, is a temperature characteristic value for reoxygenation, k20 is the value of k2 at temperature To, which is usually taken as 20°c, and kZTi s the value of k, at any other temper- ature T. The factors affecting k2 include the stream velocity and depth of flow. If we use the material balance of Equation 13-19 and assume that conditions are steady-state and that the production consists of the algebraic sum of deoxygenation and re- oxygenation, then we get the following differential equation: which has the following solution: in which Do is the initial DO deficit. Equation 13-49 is known as the Streeter-Phelps oxygen sag equation and has the form shown in Figure 13-3. It is noted that the predicted D, from Equation 13-49 does not consider the effects of other oxygen demands (that is, sediment) and supply (for example, algae). An engineer would be interested in knowing the largest oxygen deficit and the location where that will occur. Since Equation 13-49 uses time as the independent variable, it will be necessary to relate distance and time. In the discussion of the time of concentration in Chap- ter 3, the following relation between flow velocity V,d istance L, and elapsed time t was in- troduced: Manning's Equation (see Equation 3-41) can be used to estimate the velocity of flow and Equation 13-50 can be substituted into the sag formula (Equation 13-49) so that it is a func- tion of distance. If the flow velocity changes through the reach, the sag relation must account for this change. The minimum dissolved oxygen concentration (the maximum deficit) is found by dif- ferentiating Equation 13-49, setting the derivative equal to 0, and solving for t, which is des- ignated tc: At time t,, the critical deficit is it:) D, = - ~ , ~ - k ~ ' i Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 ----------.-. ............................. ----------- -,-- Do = initial oxygen deficit Dt = DO deficit at time t Dc = critical deficit - C .0- lu CLc Q, 0c 0 0 C Q, g Minimum DO safe for fish life 6 u -? 0 V) iiV ) Time of Total Deficit Point of Waste Discharge Time FIGURE 13-3 Oxygen sag curves: partial deficit and total deficit.

The initial BOD concentration is 5.1 mgL. Assume that the storm occurs in the summer (T = 25Oc) and that the DO concentration in the runoff is 7 mg/L. The runoff discharges into a small stream where the flow rate is 8 cfs at a temperature of 21°c, with a BOD of 3 mg/L and a dissolved oxygen con- centration of 7.4 m a .

{"paragraph": "13.7 ROUTING A LOADOGRAPH As indicated previously, a pollutograph relates concentration versus time, while a loado- graph relates load versus time. If the concentration of a pollutant is assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the volume at a river cross section, then it can also be assumed that the material will travel through the reach in a manner similar to the flow itself. Thus, a pollu- tograph will undergo translation and attenuation just as the flow experiences these effects. The translation is physically necessary, and attenuation reflects the mixing that will take place as the mass of material moves through the reach. The procedure for computing the pollutograph at a downstream section is as follows: Water Quality Estimation Chap. 13 1. Route the discharge hydrograph through the reach. 2. Compute the loadograph at the upstream section using Equation 13-1. 3. Route the loadograph through the reach using the same routing equation used to route the hydrograph. 4. Compute the pollutograph at the downstream section using the routed hydrograph and routed loadograph with Equation 13-1. It is important to note that the pollutograph cannot be routed with the routing equation because the total load at the downstream section will not equal the total load at the upstream section. Routing the loadograph is necessary to ensure continuity of mass. The loadograph can be routed using one of the channel routing methods introduced in Chapter 10: Convex, Muskingum, Muskingum-Cunge, or the modified Att-Kin Method. The routing coefficient(s) used for routing the flow can also be used for routing the loadograph.

FIGURE 13-4 Upstream hydrograph and pollutograph: Jones Falls at Lake Roland Dam. Sec. 13.7 Routing a Loadograph 715 loadograph can be multiplied by the exponential component (e-k7 of Equation 13-23, with the travel time through the reach used as the time t. A value would be required for the decay coefficient. It is important to note that it would be incorrect to apply Equation 13-23 to the pollutograph at the upstream cross section because then the translation and attenuation ef- fects would be absent. Example 13-14 Data for a storm event at the Jones Falls station at Lake Roland Dam (01589452) can be used to demonstrate the procedure. The measurements were collected at nonconstant time intervals for both the flow and the concentration of total organic nitrogen (mg/L). Because hydrologic routing methods require a constant time interval, a constant-interval hydrograph and pollutograph were obtained by interpolating from plots. A numerical interpolation scheme that can be used with nonconstant intervals, such as the Lagrange Interpolation Method, could be used, but a graphical interpolation should provide sufficient accuracy. The measured data for the hydrograph and pol- lutograph are shown in Figure 13-4; values of the interpolated hydrograph and pollutograph are given in Table 13-15.

Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethcal implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? Discussion Question 723 You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. A manufacturer discharges liquid wastes into a local stream on a continuous flow basis. By State law, the engineer who works for the manufacturer is required to take weekly samples of the discharge to ensure that the concentration of certain pollutants does not violate state standards. The company is required to stop discharging wastes if the sam- pling indicates the standard is being violated and then file a report to the state water quality board. While the samples have always indicated that the state standard is being met, on one occasion, the sampling indicates that the discharge from the plant is in violation of the standard. The engineer knows that the plant has not changed its process. The engineer notifies the boss, as is company regulation, and the boss gives instructions to ignore the results of the sampling. Therefore, the engineer does not shut down the operation or file the written report.

{"paragraph": "14.1 INTRODUCTION Evaporation is the process by which the phase of water is changed from a liquid to a vapor. While water vapor may result from a change of phase from a solid to a gas, hydrologists are pri- marily concerned with evaporation losses from an open water body (that is, the change of phase from liquid to a gas). In addition to evaporation from free water surfaces, water molecules pass to the atmosphere from plant surfaces; this process is called tmnspiration. In the transpi- ration process, the water passes through the plant and is evaporated at the surface of the plant. Evapotranspiration is the total water loss from a field in which significant amounts of water are lost through transpiration from plant surfaces and evaporation from the underlying soil. In terms of the hydrologic cycle of Figure 1-1, evaporation and transpiration represent a significant portion of the water movement through the hydrologic cycle. Approximately 70% of the precipitation in a temperate climate returns to the atmosphere directly by way of evaporation or transpiration losses. The remaining 30% appears as streamflow. In compari- son to streamflow, evaporation and transpiration are not major design variables in engineer- ing hydrologic design. With the exception of a few design situations, evaporation is consid- ered to be part of the loss function, although during storm events it is probably a very minor part of the total losses. Evaporation losses are considered in the design of large water storage reservoirs. Free water evaporation can be as much as 100 in. per year in the more arid parts of the United States. Where heat storage within the water body is significant, evaporation may be much greater. Even in the humid eastern part of the United States, more than 2 ft of evaporation losses can be expected from a free-water surface during a 1-yr period. In areas where annual rainfall is low, evaporation losses can represent a significant part of the water budget for a lake, and evaporation losses may contribute significantly to the lowering of the water surface elevation. This may have consequences in terms of water quality, recreational use of the lake, allocation of water for irrigation demand, and power generation. Monthly, seasonal, or annual evaporation losses may have to be considered in the design of the reser- voir and the retarding structure. With the development of more complex hydrologic models, especially the continuous moisture accounting models, algorithms for malung reasonable estimates of evaporation and evapotranspiration losses for periods of one day and less are needed. These hydrologic mod- els can be used for any number of engineering design problems, and their value as a model rests on the idea of continuous accounting of soil moisture. Estimates of evapotranspiration may also be used for irrigation scheduling. Water losses through transpiration must be replaced if the crop is to produce maximum yield. U'ater availability is especially critical during periods where nonoptimum moisture can signifi- cantly affect crop growth. Estimation of water losses may then be used to schedule imgation patterns and rates. Sec. 14.2 Factors Affecting Evaporation 727 While the design aspect of evaporation is relatively easy, the analysis phase is ex- tremely complex. Accurate analysis requires considerable cost and effort in obtaining the necessary measurements and involves an experimental design where the watershed is con- trolled. Only a few detailed analyses have been undertaken and the methods for design are largely based on the association between measured meteorological data and the results of these detailed analyses. Therefore, the analysis problem will be largely ignored here, and the discussion will center on the design or synthesis phase.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the hydrologic cycle, what role do evaporation and transpiration play?", "answer": "Evaporation and transpiration represent a significant portion of the water movement through the hydrologic cycle, with approximately 70% of precipitation in a temperate climate returning to the atmosphere directly by way of these processes."}, {"question": "How do evaporation losses from free water surfaces compare to streamflow in terms of engineering hydrologic design?", "answer": "Evaporation losses are considered part of the loss function in engineering hydrologic design, but they are not major design variables compared to streamflow, except in the design of large water storage reservoirs where evaporation losses can be significant."}, {"question": "Why are estimates of evapotranspiration important for irrigation scheduling?", "answer": "Estimates of evapotranspiration are crucial for irrigation scheduling because water losses through transpiration must be replaced for crops to produce maximum yield, especially during periods of nonoptimum moisture.

{"paragraph": "14.2.2 Humidity and Vapor Pressure The vapor content of the air mass overlying a body of water is an important determinant of evaporation rates. The molecules of water in the air mass exert a pressure on the free water surface. As the vapor pressure of the overlying air mass increases, the rate of evaporation from the water body will decrease. The vapor pressure, denoted as e, is the difference in the Evaporation Chap. 14 atmospheric pressure with and without the vapor (that is, the partial pressure of the water vapor in the air mass). If water continues to evaporate from the free water surface, the overlying air will be- come saturated. The pressure exerted when the overlying air is saturated with vapor is called the saturated vapor pressure, which is denoted as e,. The saturated vapor pressure is a func- tion of the temperature; values of e, are given in Table 14-1. The ratio of the actual vapor pressure to the saturated vapor pressure is called the relative humidity (R,,): If R, is expressed as a percentage, the value of Equation 14-2 should be multiplied by 100. The amount of vapor that an air mass can hold is a function of the temperature. When the air mass is cooled under constant pressure and with a constant water vapor content, a temperature is reached at which the air becomes saturated. This temperature is called the dew point temperature. If the temperature decreases beyond the dew point temperature, the water vapor in the air will condense.

Firstly, it simplifies the measurement process, as temperature is generally easier and less expensive to measure than radiation. This can make evaporation rate estimation more accessible and cost-effective, potentially allowing for more widespread application of these estimates in hydrological studies and water resource management. However, relying on temperature as a proxy also means that any estimates of evaporation rates are indirectly dependent on the correlation between temperature and radiation.

{"paragraph": "14.2.4 Wind Speed Evaporation rates are controlled, in part, by the vapor content of the air mass overlying the water body. As the volume of water evaporated increases, the evaporation rate from the water body decreases unless the more saturated air mass is transported from the overlying air space and replaced by air that has a lower moisture content. For low rates of air mass move- ment, less water will evaporate from the water body because of the relatively higher vapor content of the overlying air mass.

This balance ensures that the total energy within the system remains constant over time, reflecting the principle of conservation of energy."}, {"question": "Why is the energy budget not discussed further in the context provided?", "answer": "The energy budget is not discussed further because, despite its theoretical accuracy, the practical challenges in measuring its components and the lack of significant difference in accuracy between simplified models and the full energy balance equation make detailed exploration of the energy budget less necessary for estimating evaporation rates in this context."}, {"question": "In the context of evaporation estimation, what is the role of simplifications of the energy balance equation?", "answer": "Simplifications of the energy balance equation play a crucial role in defining the structure of models for estimating evaporation rates.

{"paragraph": "14.4 WATER BUDGET -G Equation 14-5 can also be used to define a water budget or water balance. The water balance is a physical analysis of the water body based on the conservation of mass. Water input to the water body may be from rainfall (P), streamflow into the water body (Q), surface runoff (Q,), and subsurface runoff (Q,). Outflow from the water body could be evaporation (0, streamflow discharge from the water body (Q,), and subsurface seepage losses (Q,). Thus, Equation 14-5 becomes Rainfall can be measured using rain gages. Streamflow and overland runoff into and out of the water body can be measured using weirs. The time rate of change of storage can be mea- sured using a stage recorder for the water surface elevation along with the necessary tope graphic data of the site. Subsurface runoff in to (Q,) and out of (Q,) the water body are the most difficult elements of the water balance to measure; these can sometimes be estimated using ele- vation measurements of observation wells placed about the perimeter of the water body; how- ever, this requires a number of measurements and an assumption of homogeneity of subsurface runoff characteristics in the area allocated to each observation well. To use Equation 14-7, it is necessary to specify a time increment dt for which each of the elements are measured. The ac- curacy of estimates of E made with Equation 14-7 will increase as dt increases, but the time in- crement selected must depend on the engineering design problem. Given the significant effort required to make the necessary measurements, water budgets, like energy budgets, are only used where the effort is warranted, such as major water resource projects. Example 1&2 To provide a brief illustration of the water-budget approach to the estimation of evaporation rates, assume that a pond with a 9-acre surface area is located on a 440-acre watershed.

The lake is in a clayey soil, so ground water flow is assumed to be negligible; surface runoff into the pond is small because the topography directs most of the flow either around the pond or into the stream, where it is mea- sured with a weir as part of the inflow. Therefore, the water balance model of Equation 14-7 re- duces to The rainfall is measured as a total depth in inches. The rainfall input is, therefore, the total water accumulated on the pond. To compute the rainfall input in acre-ft, which is denoted as P,, the value of P must be adjusted by in which A, is the area of the pond in acres. The streamflow into (Q) and out of (Q,) the pond are measured with weirs and expressed in ft3/sec. To convert the discharges to acre-ft, the following relationship can be used: in which n is the number of days in the month, Q the average discharge in ft3/sec, and Q, the av- erage discharge in acre-fdmonth. A similar relationship can be used to convert the average out- flow Q, in ft3/sec to acre-ft: The water surface elevation is recorded in feet above some datum. To convert the change in ele- vation to a volume, the value must be multiplied by the pond surface area and the appropriate di- mensional adjustments made: in which d is the change in the water surface elevation in ft, and dSldt is the change in storage in acre-ft per month.

A total volume of 14.86 acre-ft evaporates from the pond during the 3-month period, with evaporation rates varying from 0.15 in./day in June to 0.26 in./day in July.

However, this requires a number of measurements and an assumption of homogeneity of subsurface runoff characteristics in the area allocated to each observation well.

However, the time increment selected must depend on the engineering design problem at hand. This means that the choice of dt is a balance between achieving high accuracy in evaporation estimates and the practical considerations of the specific project, including the availability of data and the scale of the water body."}, {"question": "How does the water balance model account for the conversion of units between different components of the water budget, such as rainfall, streamflow, and evaporation?", "answer": "The water balance model accounts for the conversion of units by applying specific relationships to each component. For example, rainfall is converted from inches to acre-ft by multiplying the total depth in inches by the area of the pond in acres. Streamflow into and out of the pond, measured in ft3/sec, is converted to acre-ft by using the number of days in the month and the average discharge.

For instance, during periods of low rainfall and inflow, coupled with high evaporation rates, the lake level can decrease. This is illustrated in the example where, during July, the low rainfall and inflow, combined with a relatively high evaporation rate, resulted in a decrease in the lake level. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for accurately estimating evaporation rates and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "How does the transformation of units in the water balance equation enable the computation of evaporation in terms of depth (in./day)?", "answer": "The transformation of units in the water balance equation, such as converting acre-ft to inches, enables the computation of evaporation in terms of depth (in./day). This is achieved by dividing the evaporation volume (in acre-ft) by the surface area of the pond (in acres) and then converting the result to inches per day.

{"paragraph": "14.5 THE PENMAN EQUATION The accuracy of a model depends on a number of factors, including the input requirements and the degree to which the structure of the model approximates the underlying physical processes. A central problem in modeling is balancing the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. As the complexity increases, one usually assumes the accuracy increases; how- ever, as the complexity increases, the input requirements and the effort required to make esti- mates also increases. Therefore, to have a manageable model, one attempts to develop a model using as much theory as possible to develop the model structure and to reduce the complexity by making simplifying assumptions but only to the point where further simplifi- cations would adversely affect the accuracy of estimates. In addition to using theory (that is, an understanding of the underlying physical principles), models are calibrated to account, in part, for the loss of accuracy due to the simplifications. This philosophy was used to develop an equation for estimating evaporation from open water surfaces. Penman (1948, 1956) reduced the energy balance of Equation 14-6 to the following: in which E,, is the net energy available for evaporation, H is the latent heat flux density, and Hs is the sensible heat flux density. Based on Dalton's diffusivity law, the following simpli- fied aerodynamic equation was used to represent the latent heat flux density: in whichflV) is an air speed function, V the air speed, eo and e, are the vapor pressures of the water surface and the air, respectively, and H, is the latent heat flux density at the water sur- face. Recognizing the relationship between temperature and vapor pressure, the diffusivity law can also be used to describe a simplified aerodynamic equation for the sensible heat flux density at the water surface (H,,): Evaporation Chap. 14 in which a is the psychrometric constant and To and Ta are the temperatures of the water sur- face and air, respectively. The psychrometric constant is given by in which C , is the specific heat of air at constant pressure, pa is the atmospheric pressure, and Hvi s the latent heat of vaporization. The Bowen Ratio is defined as the ratio of the sensible heat loss to the latent heat flux. Since the sensible heat flux does not lend itself to easy mea- surement, the Bowen Ratio is often approximated. Using the simplified aerodynamic equa- tions, the Bowen Ratio (B) can be approximated by Therefore, Equation 14-8 can be rewritten as One problem with Equation 14-13 is the requirement for water surface measurements; this is a problem because water surface measurements are not usually available at sites where esti- mates are required and would obviously not be available for a proposed design site. A number of simplifications can be used to eliminate the need for water surface mea- + surements. The slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at mean temperature (To Ta)/2 is denoted as A and given by in which e,* is the saturation vapor pressure at temperature Ta.R earranging Equation 14-14 for (To- Ta)a nd substituting the result into Equation 14-12 yields If we define Eaou sing only air measurements as and divide by Equation 14-9, we get Substituting the identity el - ea = (e, - e,) - (e, - el ) into Equation 14-17 yields Sec. 14.5 The Penman Equation Equation 14-19 can be rearranged: which, when substituted into Equation 14-15, yields If we assume that E is approximated with Hw,a s was assumed in Equation 14-12, then Equa- tion 14-13 becomes Substituting Equation 14-21 into Equation 14-22 yields Solving Equation 14-23 for Hw yields + AE,, aEa, which is an equation for estimating the evaporation at the water surface as a function of En, E,,, A, and a. If we are to assume that water surface measurements are not required, the air tempera- ture will have to be used in place of the average of the air and water temperature that was as- sumed for Equation 14-14. This may be a reasonable assumption for time periods of about 1 day, although it may not be an accurate assumption for shorter time intervals of an hour or so. Data for the saturation vapor pressure can be obtained from Table 14-1. The value of the psychrometric constant is computed using Equation 14-1 1. This re- quires values of the specific heat of air at constant pressure and the atmospheric pressure. The latent heat of vaporization is 540 callg at 100°C. A typical value of a is 0.485 rnrn Hgl°C. The net radiation (R,) can be used to estimate E in Equation 14-24 and approximated by in which R, is the amount of radiation absorbed and RB is the net outward flow of longwave radiation. The value of R, can be approximated by in which r is the reflection coefficient, a and b are empirical coefficients that are location de- pendent, nlD is the fraction of possible sunshine, and RA is the total possible radiation for the period of estimation. The total possible radiation is a function of latitude and time of year; values can be obtained from Table 14-3.

Values of a = 0.2 and b = 0.5 appear to be reasonable estimates unless site- specific values are calibrated from data. The fraction of possible sunshine nlD varies with location and time of year. Percent- ages for the United States are shown in Figure 14-1 for the month of June. Values for other months are readily available in climatic atlases or tables of hydrometeorological data. The value of r is also an empirical coefficient. It is a function of the time of year, the smoothness of the water surface, the wind speed, and the quality of the water. Values typi- cally range from 0.05 to 0.12. The value of the net outward flow of radiation can be estimated from the following empirical equation: * in which u = 1.177.7 cal/(cm2 - ' K ~- day), T, is the absolute temperature (= T, + 273), and e is the actual vapor pressure of the air (mrn Hg). Values computed from Equations 14-26 and 14-27 can be used to compute the value of R, with Equation 14-25. The value of E,, (&day) in Equation 14-24 must also be estimated using an empiri- cal formulation based on the diffusivity law: + E,, = 0.35 (e, - e) (0.2 0.55V) (14-28) in which V is the wind speed in m/sec at a height of 2 m, and e is the actual vapor pressure at air temperature T,. The constants of Equation 14-28 are a function of location and the units of the variables. Example 14-3 Consider the design problem that a reservoir with a surface area of 30 acres will be built in cen- tral Arizona (latitude = 32\"N). For simplicity, we will assume that the design variable with re- spect to evaporation is the total evaporation for June and July. For design, the normal daily aver- age temperature will be used to represent the air temperature; values of 30°C and 32°C are obtained from a climatic atlas for June and July, respectively. The climatic atlas shows average relative humidities of 30 and 40% for June and July, respectively.

A wind speed of 2.7 rntsec for both June and July is also obtained from a cli- matic atlas.

Thus for the design period the total evaporation loss would be Thus the water level in the reservoir will decrease almost 0.5 m during the design period. This should be considered along with other losses in the design of the reservoir. The computations above assumed that r = 0.06. The effect of this assumption can be checked by modifying the value of r and recomputing the change in evaporation. The sensitivity of ET to variation in r can be analyzed. If we change r to 0.1 and recompute the mean daily evap- oration rates, we get 7.70 d d a y a nd 7.37 d d a y f or June and July, respectively (see Table 14-5). These yield a total evaporation rate of 459 mm for the 61-day period. Thus the increase in r reduced the estimated evaporation by 20 mm, or 4%. The sensitivity of ET to r is Sec. 14.5 The Penman Equation TABLE 14-5 Computation Sheet for Penman's Equation: Example 14-3.

The value of the sensitivity can be used to approximate the change in ET for any other specified change in r (Ar).F or example, if we need to estimate the change in ET that would re- sult from a change in r of 0.07, then Equation 14-30a can be rearranged to solve for AE,: AET = S, (Ar) = - 500 mm (0.07) = - 35 mm (14-31) Thus, while ET for r = 0.06 was 479 mm, we would expect ET to be approximately (479 - 35) = 444 mm for r = 0.13. The use of the sensitivity coefficient eliminates the need to perform the calculations for other values of r as long as the linearity of Equation 14-3 1 is valid or the accu- racy requirements are not greater than that provided by the linearity of sensitivity computed with Equation 14-3 1. 740 Evaporation Chap. 14", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of modeling evaporation from open water surfaces, what is the primary challenge in developing a model?", "answer": "The primary challenge is balancing the trade-off between complexity and accuracy, as increasing complexity often requires more input requirements and effort, which can be manageable only by making simplifying assumptions without compromising accuracy."}, {"question": "How does the Penman equation estimate evaporation at the water surface, and what are the key factors involved?", "answer": "The Penman equation estimates evaporation at the water surface as a function of the net energy available for evaporation (En), the psychrometric constant (a), the saturation vapor pressure curve slope at mean temperature (A), and the air temperature.

These assumptions can affect the accuracy of evaporation estimates, as they may not always reflect the actual conditions.

This sensitivity analysis can help in making more informed design decisions, especially when there is uncertainty about the exact values of certain parameters.

{"paragraph": "14.6 MASS TRANSFER ESTIMATION The initial attempts at estimating the mass of water transferred from the liquid state to the vapor state were based on Dalton's law of diffusivity. Dalton found that the mass transfer (E) was primarily a function of the difference between the saturation vapor pressure (e,) and the actual vapor pressure (e,) of the air mass overlying the water body: E = b, (e, - e,) in which b, is an empirical coefficient. For a given site, the value of b, could be obtained using measurements of evaporation rates and the air and water surface temperatures. Later studies showed that b, was a function of the air turbulence and that the accuracy of estimates could be improved by accounting for the effect or air turbulence. This led to a number of msss transfer equations of the form in which f(V) is an empirical function involving wind speed and b, is an empirical coeffi- cient. In such equations, wind speed is the variable used to reflect the movement of drier air into the lake environment to replace the air with a higher water vapor content. For example, Meyer (1915) presented the following mass transfer equation: + E = 0.5 (1 0.1 V,,) (e, - e,) (14-34) in which V,, is the wind speed in r n i h at a height of 30 ft above the water surface. For shorter time periods where V shows significant variation about the mean value, Equation 14-33 can provide more accurate estimates than Equation 14-32; however, for longer time periods where there is little variation about the mean wind'speed, Equation 14-33 may not result in a significant improvement in the accuracy of estimation. In addition to the empirical structure of Equation 14-34, other forms have been tried, including some that include variables other than vapor pressure and wind speed. The follow- ing equation was developed in 1958 as part of a study using data from Lake Mead: E = 0.072V3, (e, - e,) [I - 0.03 (To - T,)] (14-35) in which Ta and T, are the air and average water temperatures (OF), respectively. Just as with regression analyses, the increase in accuracy will be less and less as more variables are added. The more complex models also require the collection of more input data. In addition to the empirical mass transfer formulas developed from Dalton's Law, a theoretical development of turbulent transport has led to two prediction equations that are more complex in both structure and data requirements than the empirical diffusion-based equations. The Thornthwaite-Holzman equation is as follows: 833k2(el - e,) (V2 - V,) E = + I~,(Z~/Z,)~(T4 59.4) in which E is the evaporation (in.h), k is the von K h i n c onstant, el and e, are the vapor pressures (in.

In comparing the highly empirical structure of Dalton's Law (Equation 14-32) and the theory-based structure of the Thornthwaite-Holzman Equation (Equation 14-36), it is evi- dent that b, of Equation 14-32 is a function of the wind velocity, temperature, and von Kk- miin's constant. The difference in accuracy of Equations 14-32 and 14-36 depends on the variability of V and T, which would be greater for the shorter time periods. Also, whereas Equation 14-32 must be calibrated to obtain a site-specific value of b,, Equation 14-36 does not require calibration. However, the accuracy of Equation1436 will depend on the degree to which the turbulent transport theory is valid and the accuracy of the measurements of T,, T,, V,, and V, at elevations of Z, and Z,. Equation 14-36 assumes a logarithmic vertical dis- tribution of both wind speed and moisture and an adiabatic atmosphere. Example 14-4 Consider the data of Table 14-6. Water and air temperature measurements were recorded at 3-hr intervals, along with the relative humidity. An average wind speed of 5 mi/hr was computed for the day. Using the air temperature and relative humidity, values for e, were computed using Equation 14-2 and Table 14-1. Values for e, were obtained using the 3-hr values of T, and Table 14-1.

This approach allows for more accurate estimates of evaporation rates, especially for shorter time periods where wind speed shows significant variation. However, for longer time periods with little variation in wind speed, the improvement in accuracy may be less significant."}, {"question": "Why is the Thornthwaite-Holzman equation considered more complex than empirical diffusion-based equations, and what are the implications of this complexity?", "answer": "The Thornthwaite-Holzman equation is considered more complex because it is based on turbulent transport theory and requires more input data, including wind speeds at different elevations, temperatures, and the von Karman constant. This complexity implies that the equation does not require calibration, unlike empirical equations, but its accuracy depends on the validity of the turbulent transport theory and the accuracy of the measurements.

In contrast, theoretical approaches like the Thornthwaite-Holzman equation have a more complex structure, incorporating variables such as wind speeds at different elevations, temperatures, and the von Karman constant, and require more detailed data. This difference in structure and data requirements reflects the underlying assumptions and mechanisms of each approach, with empirical methods relying on observed relationships and theoretical methods grounded in physical principles."}, {"question": "What is the role of wind speed in mass transfer equations, and why is it used to reflect the movement of drier air into the lake environment?", "answer": "Wind speed is used in mass transfer equations to reflect the movement of drier air into the lake environment, replacing air with a higher water vapor content. This is because wind speed is a key factor in determining the rate of air turbulence, which in turn affects the evaporation rate. By incorporating wind speed, equations like Meyer's can account for the impact of air turbulence on evaporation, particularly for shorter time periods with significant wind speed variations."}, {"question": "How does the accuracy of mass transfer equations depend on the variability of wind speed and temperature, and what are the implications for estimation?", "answer": "The accuracy of mass transfer equations, such as the Thornthwaite-Holzman equation, depends on the variability of wind speed and temperature. For shorter time periods with significant variability, these equations can provide more accurate estimates. However, for longer time periods with less variability, the improvement in accuracy may be less significant. This implies that the choice of equation should consider the time scale and conditions of the estimation, balancing complexity with the potential for improved accuracy."}, {"question": "In the context of mass transfer estimation, why is it challenging to improve the accuracy of estimates by adding more variables to empirical equations?", "answer": "Adding more variables to empirical equations can lead to diminishing returns in terms of accuracy improvement. This is because the increase in complexity may not necessarily capture the underlying physical processes more accurately, and the additional variables may introduce more uncertainty. Furthermore, the collection of more input data required for these complex models can be challenging, making it difficult to achieve significant improvements in accuracy."}, {"question": "What are the differences between the Thornthwaite-Holzman equation and Sverdrup's equation in terms of their development and underlying theory?", "answer": "The Thornthwaite-Holzman equation and Sverdrup's equation are both based on turbulent transport theory but differ in their specific development and underlying assumptions.

{"paragraph": "14.7 PAN EVAPORATION In making a water balance, the time rate of change of storage is evaluated by measuring the change in the water surface elevation. However, because the change in the water surface ele- vation is a function of the other water inputs and outputs, it is not a direct measure of evapo- ration. However, we can apply the same principle (that is, conservation of mass) to a con- fined water body where the other elements can be controlled and use the water balance equation of Equation 14-7. This is done by applying the principle of conservation of mass to a controlled water body; in this case, the water body is a pan. A pan will not be subject to water inflow or outflow by way of surface or subsurface flow. Thus the water balance of Equation 14-7 reduces to Evaporation Chap. 14 in which Ep is the evaporation from the pan. Pan evaporation can be estimated by solving Equation 14-37 for Ep: The heat/energy environment of a pan is not the same as the environment of the water body. Therefore, Ep is not the same as E of Equation 14-7; however, the value of Ep is usually as- sumed to be proportional to E, with the following relationship assumed: in which cp is called the pan coefficient. The pan coefficient is necessary because evapora- tion from a pan exceeds that from either an open body of water or a well-wetted soil surface. The use of a pan to estimate lake evaporation has several advantages. It eliminates in- accuracies associated with measurements made for the water balance of Equation 14-7. It is inexpensive; the cost of a pan is minimal, and the cost of data collection can be minimized by using mechanical recording devices. It is easy to instrument, and the value of c, in Equa- tion 14-39 is relatively constant for a given location; thus the analysis (that is, estimation of cp) is easy. Three types of pan setups are available: surface, sunken, and floating. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. A sunken pan is a pan that is placed in the ground with the water surface in the pan at about the same level as the ground. Although this is a stable envi- ronment, it is subject to a number of problems. It is difficult to maintain as trash can be blown into the pan. The accuracy of evaporation estimates i; limited because of the difficulty in estimating heat transfer through the sides of the pan. Ol;viously, if the pan leaks, inaccu- rate estimates of evaporation will result. A floating pan is conceptually ideal because the pan exists in the same environment as the water body. However, a floating pan is difficult to maintain, is somewhat inaccessible for data collection and maintenance, and is subject to splashing action. The most common type of pan is the standard U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan. It has a diameter of 4 ft, and the water is maintained at a depth of about 10 in. The pan is made of galvanized steel and sits on a slatted platform about 6 in. above the ground. While a lake stores heat, the heat storage within the pan is minimal and has no effect on evaporation rates from the pan. The pan evaporation can be corrected for advected energy. The task of design (that is, synthesis) can be handled in one of two ways: using actual pan evaporation measurements or maps of pan evaporation. In both cases, estimates of lake evaporation will require the linear transformation of Equation 14-39. The value of the pan coefficient is considered to be location dependent; values for the United States are shown in Figure 14-2. Whether the estimated pan evaporation is obtained from a map or from mea- surements depends on a number of factors such as the necessary accuracy and the time inter- val of the required estimates. For annual values. estimates of Ep can be obtained from Figure 14-3. Figures 14-2 and 14-3 were used to derive the mean annual lake evaporation, which is shown in Figure 14-4. The mean May-October evaporation as a percentage of the annual evaporation is shown in Figure 14-5. FIGURE 14-2 Mean annual class A pan evaporation (in inches).

DISCUSSION QUESTION The technical content of this chapter is important to the professional hydrologist, but practice is not confined to making technical decisions. The intent of this discussion question is to show that hydrologists must often address situations where value issues intermingle with the 750 Evaporation Chap. 14 technical aspects of a project. In discussing the stated problem, at a minimum include re- sponses to the following questions: 1 What value issues are involved, and how are they in conflict? 2. Are technical issues involved with the value issues? If so, how are they in conflict with the value issues? 3. If the hydrologist attempted to rationalize the situation, what rationalizations might he or she use? Provide arguments to suggest why the excuses represent rationalization. 4. What are the hydrologist's alternative courses of action? Identify all alternatives, re- gardless of the ethical implications. 5. How should the conflict be resolved? You may want to review Sections 1.6 to 1.12 in Chapter 1 in responding to the problem statement. Case. A research hydrologist obtains a contract to develop a model for estimating lake evaporation rates from high-elevation lakes. The researcher sets of a series of remote monitoring instruments to collect the data, as detailed in the research plan used to obtain the funding. At the end of the first period of data collection, the hydrologist finds out that the ra- diometers at two of the seven lakes were miscalibrated and the radiation data collected at these two sites is worthless. Fearing embarrassment and the delay in completing the research, the hydrologist uses synthetic data estimated from the radiation data measured at the other five sites and reports the synthetically generated data as actual measured data.

{"paragraph": "15.1 INTRODUCTION Erosion can be loosely defined as the wearing away of the land. Erosion processes, which in- volve forces associated with water, wind, ice, and gravity are constantly at work wearing down Earth's surface. Water erosion is deemed the most widespread agent of the erosion process and is responsible for the bulk of the sediment transported from the land to the sea. Precipitation along with a variety of other factors breaks down rocks, which forms soil and debris. The resulting matter is transported through rills, gullies, channels, and other water- courses toward the oceans. The four primary activities that accelerate rates of erosion are logging, mining, agricul- ture, and construction. For example, when land is disturbed by construction activities, soil erosion may increase from 2 to 40,000 times the preconstruction erosion rate. This is evi- denced by the fact that each year approximately 80 million tons of sediment is washed from construction sites into lakes, rivers, and other waterways (Goldman et al., 1986). From our farmlands alone, 1600 million tons of soil that carry valuable soil nutrients needed for grow- ing crops is washed from our farms and into nearby lakes and reservoirs (NRC, 1986). Numerous problems arise from inadequate control of erosion rates and sedimentation. One problem that is visually apparent is the suspended sediment in rivers and streams. In ad- dition to the negative aesthetic value, the environmental effects of suspended sediment and deposited soil on aquatic habitat are widely known. Engineers are continually concerned with washouts at culverts, highways, bridges, and other engineering structures. The agricul- tural engineer is concerned with the maintenance of topsoil (that is, soil conservation) to maintain productivity. Channel stability is important to those who own stream bank property, whether it is the farmer who wishes to maximize his or her productive acreage or the home- owner who has a home that is adjacent to a stream. For engineering projects involving stor- age reservoirs, the rate of loss of capacity due to sediment accumulation is important. Those involved in navigation are sometimes concerned about the size and shape of delta forma- tions. Numerous other specific problems associated with erosion and sedimentation could be discussed. The examples cited are sufficient to emphasize the importance of the topic. The effects of erosion are not limited to environmental impacts. Erosion has economic impacts as well. Although these costs are difficult to quantify, some examples may help to Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 put them in perspective. When excessive sediment is accumulated in a reservoir, the reser- voir must be dredged and the soil material disposed of. In Cull Canyon Reservoir located in Alameda County, California, less than 10% of the watershed has been urbanized. Eleven years after construction of the reservoir, 400,000 yd3 of sediment was removed. The cost was approximately $1 million (Goldman et al., 1986). Another economic impact of erosion was cited by the Committee on Public Works in their report to the House of Representatives. Ac- cording to this report, much of the sediment in streams comes from the bed and banks, and in 1969, this sediment was causing an estimated loss of $90 million annually (House of Repre- sentatives, 1969). In addition, according to the Department of Agriculture, with better tech- nology and methods for channel and gully stabilization and control, there is a potential for the saving of land and a reduction of damages to structures of 460 million annually (USDA, 1978). Before discussing the details of erosion and sedimentation, it is important to acknowl- edge the potential effects of inaccuracies in engineering designs. The underestimation of sed- iment yields may lead to the underdesign of an engineering structure, which may result in ei- ther a project life that is shorter than expected or the need for unplanned cleanup expenditures. The overestimation of sediment yields will lead to overdesign and thus a waste of resources that could be used for alternative projects. Design uncertainty implies engineer- ing risk. Thus whenever an estimate is made, every effort should be made to evaluate the ac- curacy of the estimate; however, risk assessment and the analysis of uncertainties are beyond the scope of this writing. 15.1. I Analysis versus Synthesis The primary emphasis of this chapter is on the use of existing estimation methods. This might lead the reader to believe that these methods are highly accurate for a wide variety of conditions. This is certainly not the case. Most existing estimation methods are highly inac- curate when used for a site or set of conditions other than that used in calibrating the method. In fact, when different estimation methods are applied at an ungaged location, the computed sediment loads may differ by one or two log cycles. This disparity reflects both the site-to- site variation that should be expected and the inaccuracy of the data used to calibrate the methods. The large uncertainty implies that, when possible, a prediction equation should be calibrated for each design case. When this is not possible, the underlying assumptions and the calibration data of the method used to make the design estimates should be fully investi- gated prior to the use of the method. In the analysis case, the modeling tasks include collecting the data, deciding on the most appropriate model structure, and then using the data to fit the coefficients of the model. The model coefficients represent the unknowns, while the knowns might include topographic factors, soil characteristics, hydrometeorological characteristics, and channel characteristics. The specific variables will depend on the type of estimation required. For example, the rain- fall intensity will be important in the estimation of splash erosion, but not in channel erosion; the channel slope will be important in the estimation of channel erosion. However, a variable representing the size of the soil particles may be important in the estimation of both splash erosion and channel erosion. Sec. 15.2 Physical Processes in Erosion and Sedimentation 755 In the synthesis or design case, the volume of sediment or amount of erosion is the un- known. To use an existing model, it is necessary to determine values of the input variables, such as topographic, channel, soil, or hydrometeorological characteristics. As stated previ- ously, it is important to compare the values of the input variables with those that were used in calibrating the design model. For best results, values for the input variables should be sim- ilar to those that were used in calibrating the method.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of erosion processes, what are the primary forces involved in wearing down Earth's surface?", "answer": "The primary forces involved in erosion processes include water, wind, ice, and gravity."}, {"question": "Why is water erosion considered the most widespread agent of the erosion process?", "answer": "Water erosion is considered the most widespread agent of the erosion process because it is responsible for the bulk of the sediment transported from the land to the sea. This is due to the role of precipitation and other factors in breaking down rocks, forming soil and debris, which is then transported through various watercourses toward the oceans. The widespread nature of water erosion is also evident in its impact on different landscapes and ecosystems, highlighting its significance in shaping Earth's surface."}, {"question": "How do human activities such as logging, mining, agriculture, and construction accelerate rates of erosion?", "answer": "Human activities like logging, mining, agriculture, and construction accelerate rates of erosion by disturbing the land, which can increase soil erosion significantly. For example, construction activities can increase soil erosion from 2 to 40,000 times the preconstruction erosion rate. This drastic increase is due to the removal of vegetation and the alteration of natural landscapes, making the soil more susceptible to erosion. The impact of these activities is further compounded by the large quantities of sediment that are washed away into waterways, affecting aquatic habitats and engineering structures."}, {"question": "In the context of sedimentation, what are some of the environmental and economic impacts of inadequate control of erosion rates?", "answer": "Inadequate control of erosion rates leads to numerous environmental and economic impacts. Environmentally, it results in suspended sediment in rivers and streams, negatively affecting aquatic habitats. Economically, it leads to costs associated with dredging reservoirs, disposing of sediment, and repairing damages to structures. For instance, the accumulation of sediment in reservoirs requires dredging, which can be costly, as seen in the case of Cull Canyon Reservoir, where the cost of removing sediment was approximately $1 million. Additionally, the loss of land and damages to structures due to erosion can be significant, with potential annual savings of $460 million through better technology and methods for channel and gully stabilization and control."}, {"question": "How does the underestimation or overestimation of sediment yields affect engineering designs and projects?", "answer": "The underestimation of sediment yields can lead to the underdesign of an engineering structure, resulting in a shorter project life or the need for unplanned cleanup expenditures.

This design uncertainty implies engineering risk, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of estimates and considering the potential consequences of inaccuracies in engineering designs."}, {"question": "In the context of erosion and sedimentation modeling, what is the significance of calibrating prediction equations for each design case?", "answer": "Calibrating prediction equations for each design case is significant because most existing estimation methods are highly inaccurate when used for conditions other than those used in calibrating the method. The large uncertainty in sediment load computations, which can differ by one or two log cycles when different methods are applied, highlights the need for site-specific calibration. This approach ensures that the model coefficients are representative of the specific conditions of the design case, leading to more accurate predictions and better engineering decisions."}, {"question": "Why is it important to investigate the underlying assumptions and calibration data of an estimation method before using it for design estimates?", "answer": "Investigating the underlying assumptions and calibration data of an estimation method is crucial because it allows engineers to understand the limitations and potential biases of the method. By doing so, engineers can assess whether the method is appropriate for the specific design case, considering factors such as topographic, soil, and hydrometeorological characteristics. This investigation is essential for making informed decisions and avoiding potential errors or inaccuracies in design estimates, which can have significant environmental and economic implications."}, {"question": "How do the variables considered in erosion and sedimentation modeling differ between analysis and synthesis cases?", "answer": "In the analysis case, the focus is on collecting data and fitting model coefficients, with variables such as topographic factors, soil characteristics, hydrometeorological characteristics, and channel characteristics being considered.

{"paragraph": "15.2 PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION Before conceptualizing the erosion processes, it may be of value to provide some general de- finitions. Erosion is a process by which soil and minerals are detached and transported. The process may also be viewed to include sedimentation, which is the deposition of particles when gravitational forces overcome the forces that cause the movement. To discuss the processes of erosion and sedimentation effectively, it is necessary to de- fine the general terminology associated with their study. This section is devoted to the devel- opment of the vocabulary necessary to gain a basic understanding of the subject. Figure 15-1 summarizes the principal factors that affect soil erosion and movement. Erosion takes place not only in the channel, but on the watershed surrounding the channel. Splash erosion occurs when raindrops strike bare soil. This breaks up soil aggre- gates and separates fine particles and organic matter from heavier soil particles. These parti- cles are then transported with the surface runoff. The runoff also contributes to sheet erosion, which is caused by shallow \"sheets\" of water that flow over the land surface and help to move loose particles toward waterways. Rill erosion occurs when surface flow begins to concentrate on the land surface. The energy of this concentrated flow begins to cut small channels called rills and is capable of detaching and transporting soil particles. m e n rills become deeper and wider, gullies are formed. Gullies are capable of transporting a larger amount of sediment since the flow rates are greater than in rills. Finally, channel erosion occurs when bank vegetation is disturbed or when the flow rate in a stream is increased beyond the critical point where bed particles initi- ate movement. These changes destroy the geomorphic equilibrium of a natural stream and cause channel erosion to begin. A stable channel is one in which there is no objectionable silting, scouring, or sedi- mentation. When these processes occur in excessive amounts, the channel becomes unstable and its natural balance is destroyed. Scouring is the erosive deformation of a channel. Aggra- dation or silting is the gradual rise in the channel bottom over its entire extent, and prograda- tion or sedimentation is the increase and advancing forward of the volume of sediment de- posited. A channel functions by transporting sediment out of the watershed by means of its flow. The total load of sediment transported by the channel is made up of the bed-material load and the wash load. These are classified according to their origin. Specifically, the bed- material load is the portion of total sediment load that is composed of grain sizes originating in the channel bed and sides. The wash load is composed of finer-grained particles with vir- tually no settling velocity that originate from the land surface of the watershed. The wash load is transported to the channel by means of splash, sheet, rill, and gully erosion.

Sec. 15.2 Physical Processes in Erosion and Sedimentation 757 material load can be further divided into bed load and suspended load. The bed load is the material too coarse to be supported in the flowing water for any appreciable amount of time. The grains move by sliding, rolling, or saltating over the bottom, continually coming to rest and then rejoining the bed load material. The suspended load can be classified as all of the particles that are lifted up by eddies in the main flow and move long distances downstream before settling to the bed. Ordinarily, the bed load portion is less than 25% of the total load but there may be exceptions to this general statement. The wash load is considered to be a part of the suspended load since it is transported by the flow at nearly the same velocity and never settles to the channel bottom. The wash load is usually represented in the channel only in very small amounts as compared to bed-material load. Whatever the rate of wash load transported through the chan- nel, neither scour nor deposition is a consequence of the wash load. Because of this, it is im- possible to accurately predict the rate of wash load without directly measuring it during the period of flow. Also, since the wash load is neither scoured nor deposited in the channel, the geometry of the channel will not be affected. Therefore, wash load is concluded to have only a very minimal, if any, direct effect on the stability of the channel. However, the wash load component may be quite significant to water quality considerations and deposition rates in large reservoirs with high trap efficiencies. The sediment yield is the total sediment outflow from a watershed or a drainage area at a point of reference during a specified period of time. This is always less than the gross ero- sion (sum of all sources of erosion in a watershed) because a fraction of the sediment is de- posited or trapped in the channel as it is transported out of the watershed. The ratio of the sediment yield to the gross erosion is called the sediment delivery ratio. It is often of great importance to the engineer to be able to determine the load transported by a channel. This is usually determined by separately calculating the suspended and bed loads and then adding the two. Since the wash load is easily transported out of the channel, it has no affect on the computations. Many equations are presently available to determine the bed load discharge. Sediment discharge refers to the rate of tr&sport of the sediment load. A relationship be- tween the sediment discharge and the water discharge is called the sediment rating curve. In engineering design, the engineer must be concerned with the erosion hazard, which is a measure or description of the erosion potential. The erosion hazard reflects the suscepti- bility of a soil to erosive agents (the erodibility) and the characteristics of the erosive agent (the erosivity). The erodibility and the erosivity represent, respectively, the soil and water potential for causing erosion.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of erosion and sedimentation, what is the primary distinction between bed-material load and wash load?", "answer": "The primary distinction between bed-material load and wash load is their origin and composition.

This process contributes to the transport of these particles with surface runoff, leading to further erosion and sedimentation. The impact of raindrops not only dislodges particles but also seals the surface, increasing precipitation excess and runoff."}, {"question": "In the process of channel erosion, why does the destruction of geomorphic equilibrium lead to erosion?", "answer": "The destruction of geomorphic equilibrium in a natural stream leads to channel erosion because it disrupts the balance between the flow rate and the bed particles. When bank vegetation is disturbed or the flow rate is increased beyond a critical point, it initiates the movement of bed particles, causing scouring, silting, or sedimentation. This imbalance destroys the stability of the channel, leading to erosion. The equilibrium is crucial for maintaining a stable channel, where there is no objectionable silting, scouring, or sedimentation."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the sediment delivery ratio, and how does it relate to gross erosion and sediment yield?", "answer": "The sediment delivery ratio is the ratio of the sediment yield to the gross erosion, indicating the fraction of sediment that is actually transported out of a watershed. It is significant because it accounts for the sediment deposited or trapped in the channel during transport. The sediment yield is always less than the gross erosion due to this deposition, making the sediment delivery ratio an important factor in understanding the efficiency of sediment transport in a watershed."}, {"question": "How do vegetative and non-vegetative covers influence soil erosion, and what are the implications for runoff and sediment transport?", "answer": "Vegetative cover protects the land surface by intercepting raindrops and retarding flow, thereby decreasing the velocity of runoff, increasing soil porosity, and enhancing soil moisture holding capacity. In contrast, non-vegetative cover, such as open surfaces or paved areas, results in minimal surface protection, leading to increased runoff, reduced infiltration, and maximum erosion. The presence of vegetative cover is crucial for minimizing erosion and sediment transport, as it directly affects the energy of flow and the susceptibility of soil to erosion."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment transport, what is the distinction between bed load and suspended load, and how do they contribute to the total sediment load?", "answer": "The bed load consists of material too coarse to be supported in flowing water for an appreciable amount of time, moving by sliding, rolling, or saltating over the bottom. The suspended load includes particles lifted by eddies in the main flow, moving long distances downstream before settling. The bed load portion is typically less than 25% of the total load, with the suspended load making up the remainder. Understanding the distinction between these loads is essential for calculating the total sediment load and predicting sediment transport and deposition."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to predict the rate of wash load without direct measurement, and what implications does this have for channel stability and water quality?", "answer": "Predicting the rate of wash load is challenging because it is neither scoured nor deposited in the channel, meaning its transport does not affect the channel's geometry. As a result, the wash load has a minimal direct effect on channel stability. However, the wash load can significantly impact water quality considerations and deposition rates in large reservoirs, especially those with high trap efficiencies. Accurate measurement of wash load during flow periods is necessary to understand its contribution to sediment yield and its implications for water quality and reservoir management."}, {"question": "How does the sediment rating curve relate sediment discharge to water discharge, and what is its significance in engineering design?", "answer": "The sediment rating curve is a relationship between the sediment discharge and the water discharge, providing a tool to predict sediment transport based on water flow.

{"paragraph": "15.2.1 Stokes The situation of a solid particle free falling through a liquid arises frequently in engineering. Three forces act on the particle: gravity, buoyancy, and drag. The first force acts downward and the latter two forces act upward. For equilibrium at terminal velocity, the sum of the forces is in which F, is the buoyant force, FD is the drag force, and W is the weight, which for a sphere are computed by the following: Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 F, = y * volume = y (7r D3/6) 1 7 FD = CD p ~ =~ p ~ 2 D . i r ~ 2 ~ 2 / 8 W = y, * volume = y, (7rD3/6) in which D is the diameter of the sphere, y is the specific weight of the fluid, V is the free-fall terminal velocity, y, is the specific weight of the soil particle, and C, is the drag coefficient. For low Reynold's Number, less than about 5, the drag coefficient is approximately Substituting Equations 15-lb, 15-lc, 15-ld, and 15-2 into Equation 15-la yields Solving for the terminal velocity gives Stokes' Law: where S, and S are the specific gravities of the soil and the liquid medium, respectively. Stokes' Law has several inherent assumptions: (1) the particle is not influenced by other par- ticles or walls of the containers; (2) the particles are spherical; and (3) the specific gravity of the soil particle and the viscosity of the fluid are known exactly. These assumptions, espe- cially the first two, do not usually hold but Stokes' Law is'commonly used in spite of these problems. For materials that are falling in water and that have a density approximately that of soil grains, Stokes' Law applies for spheres that have diameters between 0.0002 mrn and 0.2 mm.

The balance between these forces is essential for calculating the terminal velocity using Stokes' Law."}, {"question": "Why is Stokes' Law commonly used despite its inherent assumptions not usually holding?", "answer": "Stokes' Law is commonly used despite its assumptions not usually holding because it provides a useful approximation for the terminal velocity of particles under certain conditions. The assumptions, such as the particle being spherical and not influenced by other particles or walls, are often not met in real-world scenarios.

A higher settling velocity results in a shorter settling time, allowing particles to settle to the bottom of the wetland more quickly. Conversely, particles with lower settling velocities take longer to settle, increasing the likelihood of them being resuspended or transported further downstream. This relationship is critical in understanding the behavior of sediment discharge in wetlands and its implications for water quality and ecosystem health."}, {"question": "What is the implication of resuspension on the settling of silt and clay particles in a river?", "answer": "The implication of resuspension on the settling of silt and clay particles in a river is that these particles are not likely to settle to the river bed. Due to their small size and low settling velocities, silt and clay particles can be easily resuspended by the flow of the river, preventing them from settling. This process can lead to these particles being transported long distances downstream, affecting water quality and potentially causing erosion or deposition in other areas of the river system."}, {"question": "How does the diameter of a particle influence its settling velocity according to Stokes' Law?", "answer": "According to Stokes' Law, the diameter of a particle directly influences its settling velocity. The law states that the settling velocity is inversely proportional to the diameter of the particle. This means that smaller particles have lower settling velocities and larger particles have higher settling velocities. This relationship is crucial for understanding the behavior of different sized particles in water and predicting their settling times and distances."}, {"question": "In the context of channel stability, why are silt and clay particles not likely to settle to the river bed?", "answer": "Silt and clay particles are not likely to settle to the river bed due to their very slow settling velocities and the potential for resuspension. Given their small diameters, these particles have very low settling velocities, making it difficult for them to settle in the presence of flowing water. Additionally, the flow of the river can easily resuspend these particles, further reducing the likelihood of them settling to the river bed.

{"paragraph": "15.3 CHANNEL STABILITY The erosion process can be controlled through proper maintenance and improvement of sta- ble channels. Lane (1937) defines the term stable channel as an unlined earth channel in which the banks and bed are not scarred objectionably by the moving water and in which ob- jectionable deposits of sediment do not occur. Others define a stable channel as one in which the average values of discharge, width, depth, slope, and meander pattern do not vary signifi- cantly over some time interval. Griffiths (1983) states that a channel may be considered sta- ble if for any given steady flow, total sediment concentration maintains a balanced average in space and time. Thus, according to these definitions of a stable channel, the gross dimen- sions such as slope, width, depth, bed elevation, and bed-material size distribution remain es- sentially constant over extended periods of time; however, both local shifts in the alignment of the channel and local aggravation or degradation are common.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of channel stability, what is the definition of a stable channel according to Lane (1937)?", "answer": "A stable channel is an unlined earth channel in which the banks and bed are not scarred objectionably by the moving water and in which objectionable deposits of sediment do not occur."}, {"question": "How does Griffiths (1983) define a stable channel in terms of sediment concentration?", "answer": "Griffiths (1983) states that a channel may be considered stable if for any given steady flow, total sediment concentration maintains a balanced average in space and time."}, {"question": "In the context of channel stability, why do local shifts in the alignment of the channel and local aggravation or degradation occur despite the channel being considered stable?", "answer": "Local shifts in the alignment of the channel and local aggravation or degradation occur despite the channel being considered stable because the gross dimensions such as slope, width, depth, bed elevation, and bed-material size distribution remain essentially constant over extended periods of time, but this does not preclude local changes.

The stability of a channel is defined in terms of average values and long-term trends, allowing for some degree of local variability."}, {"question": "What are the implications of a channel being considered stable according to the definitions provided?", "answer": "The implications of a channel being considered stable are that the gross dimensions such as slope, width, depth, bed elevation, and bed-material size distribution remain essentially constant over extended periods of time. This stability is crucial for maintaining a balanced ecosystem and preventing erosion or sedimentation issues.

However, they differ in their focus, with Lane (1937) emphasizing the absence of objectionable erosion or sedimentation, and Griffiths (1983) focusing on the balance of sediment concentration in space and time.

By examining these average values, it is possible to determine whether the channel is stable or undergoing significant changes. This information is critical for predicting and mitigating potential issues such as erosion or sedimentation, and for developing effective strategies for channel maintenance and improvement."}, {"question": "In the context of channel stability, what is the significance of maintaining a balanced average sediment concentration in space and time?", "answer": "Maintaining a balanced average sediment concentration in space and time is significant because it indicates that the channel is in a state of equilibrium, where the amount of sediment being transported into the channel is equal to the amount being deposited or transported out. This balance is crucial for preventing erosion or sedimentation issues, and for maintaining the stability of the channel. A balanced sediment concentration also suggests that the channel is able to adapt to changes in flow patterns and sediment transport, which is essential for long-term stability."}, {"question": "How do the gross dimensions of a channel, such as slope, width, depth, bed elevation, and bed-material size distribution, affect its stability?", "answer": "The gross dimensions of a channel, such as slope, width, depth, bed elevation, and bed-material size distribution, play a crucial role in determining its stability. These dimensions influence the flow patterns, sediment transport, and erosion rates within the channel, and changes to these dimensions can have significant impacts on the channel's stability. For example, a change in slope can affect the flow velocity and sediment transport capacity, while a change in bed elevation can alter the water depth and flow patterns.

{"paragraph": "15.3.1 Methods of Channel Stability Analysis The analysis of earth channels requires knowledge of the relationships between the channel boundaries and the water flowing within them. In general, the problem of stable channel de- sign involves a study of the relationships between six major variables: the water discharge, a typical diameter of the bed material, the total sediment concentration, the energy slope, the wetted perimeter, and the hydraulic radius. In wide channels, the wetted perimeter can be ap- proximated by the base width and the hydraulic radius by the depth of flow. The methods used to evaluate channel stability depend on the classification of the channel boundaries. Once the channel is classified, a proper stability evaluation can be con- ducted and the magnitude of channel instability calculated to determine whether or not stabi- lizing measures are needed. A distinction is made between channels with essentially rigid boundaries and those with mobile boundaries. Channels that have rigid boundaries are stable when the interaction between the flow and the material that forms the channel boundary causes no erosion. When the boundaries of a channel are unable to resist the forces caused by the flow under consideration, the channel is considered to have mobile boundaries. Channels that have mobile boundaries attain stability when the rate at which sediment enters the chan- nel is approximately equal to the capacity of the channel to transport sediment of a similar composition. Specific methods of stability analysis are generally associated with each type of chan- nel. For instance, channels that are classified as having essentially rigid boundaries generally require a theoretical approach to stable channel design such as the tractive stress or allowable velocity method. Both of these design methods are based on the design of a channel in which Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 no appreciable sediment movement takes place. Channels classified as having mobile bound- aries most often use a more empirical approach to stable channel design such as the regime approach or the sediment transport approach. Both the regime approach and the sediment transport approach allow for sediment transport, but in such a way that the total erosion and deposition at any point in the channel is equal to zero. Although attempts have been made to guide the engineer in selecting the appropriate stability analysis method, set rules are not available for choosing the correct procedure and often decisions are based mainly on the availability of data and the desired accuracy. According to some researchers, there are two basic approaches to design a stable chan- nel are: 1. If the flow entering the channel does not carry an appreciable amount of sediment, the method of maximum permissible velocity or the method of critical tractive force can be used. Both methods are based on the design of a channel in which no appreciable sediment movement takes place. 2. If the flow entering the channel carries a considerable amount of sediment, the regime method should be employed. In this method, the channel is designed so that sediment transport does take place but in such a way that the total process of erosion and deposi- tion at any point along its length is equal to zero. However, these limitations on the use of the alternative categories are not restrictive in that all methods can be applied for both clear and sediment laden flows when the appropriate ad- justments are made. .-", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of channel stability analysis, what are the six major variables that need to be considered?", "answer": "The six major variables are the water discharge, a typical diameter of the bed material, the total sediment concentration, the energy slope, the wetted perimeter, and the hydraulic radius."}, {"question": "How do the methods used to evaluate channel stability depend on the classification of the channel boundaries?", "answer": "The methods used to evaluate channel stability depend on whether the channel boundaries are classified as essentially rigid or mobile.

This distinction is essential for selecting the correct stability analysis method and ensuring the channel's stability."}, {"question": "In the context of channels with mobile boundaries, how do the regime approach and the sediment transport approach ensure channel stability?", "answer": "The regime approach and the sediment transport approach ensure channel stability by allowing for sediment transport in such a way that the total erosion and deposition at any point in the channel is equal to zero. This means that the rate of sediment entering the channel is balanced by the rate of sediment being transported out of the channel, resulting in no net change in the channel's shape or size."}, {"question": "What are the two basic approaches to designing a stable channel, according to some researchers?", "answer": "The two basic approaches are: (1) using the method of maximum permissible velocity or the method of critical tractive force when the flow entering the channel does not carry an appreciable amount of sediment, and (2) employing the regime method when the flow entering the channel carries a considerable amount of sediment."}, {"question": "How do the limitations on the use of alternative categories affect the selection of a stability analysis method?", "answer": "The limitations on the use of alternative categories are not restrictive, as all methods can be applied for both clear and sediment-laden flows when the appropriate adjustments are made.

{"paragraph": "15.3.2 Permissible Velocity Method The method of permissible velocity is one of the oldest methods of stable channel design in alluvial material. In this method, the channel is designed for the greatest mean velocity that will not cause erosion of the channel cross section. Values of permissible velocity for various channels are obtained by collecting data from existing stable channels and developing empir- ical equations that relate the permissible velocity to both flow parameters and properties of the soil and channel cross section. The permissible velocities listed in Table 15-1 are intended for well-seasoned chan- nels of small slopes and for depths of flow of less than 3 ft. They were determined from ex- isting channels of various soils. The channel material plays an important role in determining the permissible velocity, and most investigators who have determined empirical values have related it to the soil texture. In using values from Table 15-1 to design a stable channel, three points should be noted: 1. A velocity increment of 0.5 ft/sec may be added to the values when the depth of water is greater than 3 ft. 2. A velocity increment of 0.5 ft/sec should be subtracted when the water contains very coarse suspended sediments. 3. For high and infrequent discharges of short duration, up to 30% may be added to the velocities shown in Table 15-1.

It is known that deeper channels can convey water at a higher mean velocity without erosion than shallower channels when all other conditions are equal. This is attributed to the fact that scouring is caused by bottom velocities and they are greater for a shallower channel. Therefore, the addition of 0.5 ftlsec to the permissible velocity when the depth is greater than 3 ft is justified. Also, the velocities listed are for relatively straight channels. For sinuous channels, the permissible velocities should be lowered in order to reduce scour. Lane (1955) suggests percentages of reduction of 5% for slightly sinuous canals, 13% for moderately sin- uous canals, and 22% for very sinuous canals. These values are very approximate since no accurate data are available. The steps involved in the design of a stable channel using the permissible velocity method are summarized as follows: 1. For a given type of channel material, estimate the roughness coefficient n, slope S, and obtain the maximum permissible velocity from a table such as Table 15-1. 2. Compute the hydraulic radius Rh from Manning's Equation. 3. Use the continuity equation to compute the water area required A = QIV for the given discharge and permissible velocity. 4. Compute the wetted perimeter, P =AIRh. 5. Solve for the channel base (W) and depth (H) according to specific channel geometry. 6. Modify the section for practicality. 762 Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 The velocities designated as the maximum permissible velocities have been developed as much by experience and judgment as by analytical analysis. They are very uncertain and subject to wide variation. Example 15-3 An engineer is designing an irrigation canal that will have a roughness of 0.06, a permissible ve- locity of 2.5 ftlsec, a slope of 0.8%, and a design discharge of 40 ft3/sec. Manning's Equation is used to compute the hydraulic radius (R,): The continuity equation is used to compute the cross-sectional area (A): Therefore, the wetted perimeter (P) is The design of the channel requires an assumption of a shape of the cross section; a trape- zoidal section is assumed. The bottom width (W)m ust be determined, which will dictate the depth of flow (H). For the trapezoidal section with side slopes z (that is, zH:V), the area and wet- ted perimeter are Thus, Equations 1 5 4a re two equations with two unknowns (Wand H). Solving these two equa- tions for the depth of flow yields and thus, the width is For a feasible solution, the square root in the numerator of Equation 154c must be at least 0, which will require a limiting value of z. As an approximation, ;should be limited by P?(~Ai)s actually larger than the allowable z. For an area of 16 ft2 and a wetted perimeter of 13.33 ft, the limit of Equation 15-4e re- quires a side slope of 2.78 to 1. Actually, the upper limit is 2.3 to 1, so for the given design, z will be set equal to 2. Equation 1 5 - 4 ~yi elds two possible flow depths, 3.59 and 1.80 ft. When these are substituted into Equation 15-4d, bottom widths of -2.73 and 5.28 ft result. Thus, the practical solution is z = 2, H = 1.8 ft, and W = 5.28 ft.

{"paragraph": "15.3.3 Regime Theory Method The regime theory of stable channel design was initiated by British engineers worlung on the irrigation canals of India and Pakistan at the beginning of the twentieth century. Kennedy, Lacey, Lindley, Blench, and others studied channels that were in an equilibrium state and yielded a set of equations to determine the dimensions of stable or regime channels. The word \"regime\" was chosen by researchers to replace the word \"equilibrium.\" The basic premise behind the theory is best explained by Lindley (1919) in his definition of the \"regime\" concept of channels as follows: \"When an artificial channel is used to carry silty water, both the bed and banks scour or fill, changing depth, gradient and width, until a state of balance is attained, at which the channel is said to be 'in regime.\"' In other words, a chan- nel formed in an erodible material will only reach a state of equilibrium when a balance ex- ists between discharge, cross section, slope, and sediment load. Once this equilibrium state is reached, a channel is said to be in regime. Kennedy (1895) was the first to develop an empirical relationship linking the nonsilt- ing velocity to the depth of the channel. By collecting data from twenty-two channels of the Upper Bari Doab canal system, he found that the mean velocity in these nonsilting channels was related to the depth by the equation in which Vc is the critical velocity at which, for a given depth, h, silting is prevented. He also proposed a similar equation for sediment sizes other than the one found in the Upper Bari Doab system: where m, the critical velocity ratio, is the ratio of the critical velocity of the channel under observation to the critical velocity of a channel that has the same size sediment as that of the Upper Bari Doab system. For sand that is'coarser than the one in the Upper Bari Doab system, m is greater than 1 and for finer sand, m is less than 1. From Equation 15-5b, it is apparent that Kennedy recognized that sediment size plays an important role in determining the relationship between velocity and depth. Equations 15-5 can be generalized to the following: in which k, is a function of the soil type. The coefficients of Equations 15-5a and 15-5b may not be accurate for general use. Site-specific data should be used to fit the power model of Equation 15-5c. Lacey (1930) tried to bring some order to the abundant data on stable channel design that were available at the time. He reanalyzed existing data and found that all of the data could be accurately represented by the following equations, where the critical velocity is re- lated to the hydraulic radius instead of the depth: in which f, is the silt factor and R, is the hydraulic radius (ft). The remaining two equations required to determine the variables for a stable channel are Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 Lacey's relationship for determining the silt factor is where d is the diameter (in.) of the predominant type of soil transported. Provided that the discharge and soil type are known, a stable channel can be designed with Equations 15-6. It was later argued by King (1943; see Graf, 1971) and Blench (1951) that the single expression for the silt factor, as determined by Lacey, did not take into account the relative importance of characteristics of the channel bed and sides, which could be different for different channels. As a further step in the regime theory, Simons and Albertson (1963) reanalyzed the regime channel concept. They provided a modified version applicable to a wider variety of channels since the range of conditions covered by their data was much wider than previous data. In the latter investigation, five different types of geotechnical channel conditions are specified. A separate equation was fitted to each type by Henderson (1966). To design a stable channel according to this method the geotechnical conditions and discharge q must be known. From these values, the average width (W), the average depth (h), and the limiting slope can be determined. Using Henderson's (1966) values of K,, K2, and K4 (see Table 15-2), which are specified according to channel type, the average width is given by The mean depth is given by < 1.21 ~ ~ q for R~, G 7 .ft ~ ~ h = [ 2.0 + 0.93 R, > 7 ft The slope can be estimated by These equations are considered the most useful form of the regime method of stable channel design.

In summary, Equations 15-7, 15-8, and 15-9 can be used to design a stable channel for live-bed conditions. Their use requires the design discharge and the critical velocity for the bed material. In the situation where a channel exists and the slope and discharge are known, Equation 15-10 can be used to compute the critical velocity. Example 15-4 A channel that will pass waste water from a new power generation plant is being designed. The plant will discharge 1550 ft3/sec.

This velocity is influenced by the size of the raindrop, with larger drops having higher terminal velocities. Understanding terminal velocity is essential for estimating the potential erosive power of rainfall, as it directly affects the kinetic energy transferred to the soil upon impact."}, {"question": "How does the size of a raindrop affect its terminal velocity, and what equation can be used to estimate this velocity?", "answer": "The size of a raindrop, specifically its mean diameter, affects its terminal velocity. The equation V_t = 120 (d_m) can be used to estimate the terminal velocity (V_t) of a raindrop, where d_m is the mean raindrop diameter.

This high kinetic energy is what makes raindrop impact such an effective mechanism for initiating soil erosion, as it can easily overcome the forces holding soil particles in place, leading to the detachment and transport of these particles."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the high kinetic energy of raindrops for soil erosion management strategies?", "answer": "The high kinetic energy of raindrops has significant implications for soil erosion management strategies. Given that raindrop impact is a primary cause of surface erosion, management strategies should focus on reducing the erosive power of rainfall, such as through the use of cover crops or mulches to absorb the impact of raindrops, or implementing conservation tillage practices to reduce soil exposure. Understanding the role of raindrop kinetic energy in soil erosion can help in the development of more effective erosion control measures, ultimately leading to better soil conservation and reduced environmental impacts."}, {"question": "How does the equation for terminal velocity relate to the process of splash erosion?", "answer": "The equation for terminal velocity, V_t = 120 (d_m), relates to the process of splash erosion by providing a means to estimate the maximum speed at which a raindrop can impact the soil surface. This speed, and thus the terminal velocity, directly influences the kinetic energy of the raindrop upon impact. A higher terminal velocity results in a higher kinetic energy, which in turn increases the potential for the raindrop to overcome the forces of adhesion and cohesion holding soil particles in place, thereby facilitating the erosion process.

These complexities can lead to uncertainties in predicting soil erosion rates and patterns, especially when the equation is applied outside its validated scope. Furthermore, complex hydrological systems may involve additional processes such as runoff, infiltration, and sediment transport, which are not directly accounted for in Ellison's equation.

{"paragraph": "15.5.1 Universal Soil Loss Equation The universal soil loss equation (USLE) is probably the most widely used erosion equation. The soil loss (E) in tonslacrelyear is a function of the erosivity index (R), a soil erodibility factor (K), the field slope (S) and length (L), a crop management factor (C),a nd a conserva- tion practice factor (P): E = RKTCP in which T is the topographic factor, which depends on L and S. The erosivity index R is a summation of individual storm products of the kinetic en- ergy of rainfall (hundreds of ft-tonslacre) and the maximum 30-min rainfall intensity (in./hr) for all significant storms in a year. The value of R has been computed for locations within the United States and is given in Figure 15-2. The soil erodibility factor (K) is the average soil loss (tons per acre per unit of the rain- fall factor R) from a particular soil in cultivated continuous fallow with standard values of Sec. 15.5 Sheet Erosion 767 FIGURE 15-2 Average annual values of the rainfall-erosivity factor, R. both the plot length and the slope, which were selected somewhat arbitrarily as 73 ft and 9%, respectively. The value of K is a functionof (1) the percent silt plus very fine sand, (2) the percent sand, (3) the percentage of organic matter, (4) a soil structure index, which is pre- sented on an ordinal scale, and (5) a permeability index, which is also measured on an ordi- nal scale. For U.S. mainland soils, the value of Kis obtained from Figure 15-3. The topographic factor (7') is a function of the slope (%) and the overland length (ft), which is usually less than 400 ft. The slope is the average land gradient. The length is the av- erage distance from the point of overland flow to whichever of the following limiting condi- tions occurs first: (1) the point where the slope decreases to the extent that deposition begins, or (2) the point where runoff enters well-defined flow areas, such as rills. Values of the topo- graphic factor are given in Table 15-3. For the index slope of 9% and the index length of 73 ft, T equals 1. The crop management factor (C)i s the ratio of the soil quantities eroded from land that is cropped under specific conditions to that which is eroded from clean-tilled fallow under identical slope and rainfall conditions. Values for C are given in Table 15-4 for the 37 states east of the Rocky Mountains. The baseline conditions for which C equals 1 are continuous fal- low, tilled up and down slope. For other cover and management conditions, C is less than l. The conservation practice factor (P) is a function of the support practice and the land slope.

Adjustments for irregularity of slope are available. Predicted values of E represent average, time-invariant estimates. Given that R is based on an average number and distribution of ,storms per year, actual values of E would vary from year to year depending on the number, size, and timing of erosive rainstorms and other weather conditions. Although any one predicted value of E may not be highly accurate, the USLE should be more reliable when it is used to measure either relative effects or long-term sheet and rill erosion rates. Example 15-5 The general data requirements for making soil loss estimates with the USLE equation are (1) site location (to get R); (2) soil properties (to get K); (3) flow length and slope (to get T); (4) crop, ro- tation, and management practices (to get C); and (5) slope and support practice (to get P). The estimation process will be illustrated using a hypothetical example. The site, which has a drainage area of 2 acres, is located in central Illinois. The site of interest has an average slope of 2.5% and a flow length of 300 ft. A soil analysis indicates 25% sand, 2% organic matter, 35% silt and very fine sand, a medium granular structure, and moderate permeability. The plot is used for corn, with a crop management value of 0.31, which was determined from information pub- lished locally. No support practice is provided. For central Illinois, Figure 15-2 suggests a value for R of 200. A value for the topographic factor can be obtained from Table 15-3; for a slope of 2.5% and a length of 300 ft, T equals 0.28. Using the soil characteristics given, a value for the soil erodibility factor of 0.17 is obtained from Figure 15-3. Since there is no support practice, P equals 1.0.

The specific values of C can be found in tables that list generalized values for various crop systems and management practices."}, {"question": "How does the conservation practice factor (P) influence soil loss predictions in the USLE, and what practices can reduce erosion?", "answer": "The conservation practice factor (P) influences soil loss predictions by accounting for the impact of support practices such as contouring, contour strip cropping, and terracing on erosion. These practices can significantly reduce soil loss by altering the flow of water over the land. For instance, contouring can reduce erosion by up to 50%, as seen in the example where contouring a field with a 2.5% slope reduces the unit erosion from 2.95 tons/acre/year to 1.5 tons/acre/year."}, {"question": "In the context of the USLE, what are the implications of using the equation for predicting long-term sheet and rill erosion rates, and why might actual values of E vary from year to year?", "answer": "The USLE is more reliable for predicting long-term sheet and rill erosion rates because it averages out the variability in rainfall and other factors over time. However, actual values of E can vary significantly from year to year due to the natural variability in the number, size, and timing of erosive rainstorms and other weather conditions. This variability means that while the USLE provides a useful tool for conservation planning and assessing the relative effectiveness of different management practices, it may not accurately predict erosion for a specific year."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the topographic factor (T) in the USLE, and how does it relate to the slope and length of the field?", "answer": "The topographic factor (T) is important because it accounts for the impact of the field's topography on soil erosion. T is a function of the slope and length of the field, with steeper and longer slopes generally leading to higher values of T and thus greater potential for erosion. The factor is crucial for accurately predicting soil loss because it reflects how the physical characteristics of the land influence the flow of water and the transport of sediment."}, {"question": "How does the USLE account for the variability in soil properties and management practices across different regions, and what are the implications for conservation planning?", "answer": "The USLE accounts for variability in soil properties and management practices through the use of factors like K, C, and P, which can be determined based on local conditions.

Several differences between Musgrave's Equation and the USLE are obvious. First, the Musgrave Equation is nonlinear. The exponents reflect the data that were used to calibrate Equation 15-15. Data from nineteen research stations, with 5 to 15 years of data collected at each station, were used in calibration. Second, the Musgrave Equation uses the slope and length directly rather than as an input to the topographic factor of the USLE. Beer, Farnham, and Heinemann (1966) provided the following equation, which is based on an empirical analysis of data from western Iowa: Sec. 15.6 Erosion in Gullies 773 in which E is the average annual soil loss (in./year); K, R, and P are the soil erodibility, rain- fall, and factors of conservation practice of the USLE; R, is a cover factor with fallow or continuous row cropping having a value of 100; and S and L are the slope (%) and length (ft) of the plot, respectively.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of soil erosion estimation, what is the Musgrave Equation, and how does it differ from the USLE?", "answer": "The Musgrave Equation is an empirical equation used to estimate probable soil loss, differing from the USLE in its nonlinearity and direct use of slope and length rather than a topographic factor.

These factors acknowledge that soil erosion is influenced by a combination of physical, environmental, and management-related variables.

This complexity also suggests that empirical equations must be carefully calibrated and validated to ensure they capture the nuances of soil erosion in different contexts."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is it essential to consider the specific conditions of the study area when selecting an empirical equation for soil erosion estimation?", "answer": "Considering the specific conditions of the study area is crucial when selecting an empirical equation for soil erosion estimation because these equations are often calibrated for specific regions or conditions. The Musgrave Equation, for example, was calibrated using data from 19 research stations, while the Beer, Farnham, and Heinemann equation was based on data from western Iowa. Using an equation outside its calibrated context can lead to inaccurate predictions, as the underlying relationships between factors may differ.

The other equations are given only to indicate that other methods exist and that some empirical evidence questions the linear structure of the USLE. Some data suggest that a non- linear form may be more appropriate. It is almost impossible to provide a quantitative assess- ment of the accuracy of the methods. For estimating soil loss in any one year, all of these methods would probably be highly inaccurate; however, for making long-term estimates of mean annual soil loss greater confidence could be placed in the estimates. One of the diffi- culties in making quantitative estimates of the accuracy is a lack of data.

This is because the variability and unpredictability of factors influencing soil loss over short periods are averaged out over longer terms, potentially leading to more reliable predictions of average annual soil loss. However, for any one year, the estimates are likely to be highly inaccurate due to the complex and variable nature of the factors involved."}, {"question": "In the context of soil loss estimation, what role do freeze-thaw cycles play?", "answer": "Freeze-thaw cycles are one of the many factors that contribute to the rates of soil loss at any given site. Their effect, along with other factors, makes it challenging to accurately estimate soil loss, especially over short periods, because these cycles can significantly impact the soil's structure and its susceptibility to erosion, thus influencing the overall soil loss."}, {"question": "Why might the USLE and other linear models be less accurate for certain types of soil or environmental conditions?", "answer": "The USLE and other linear models might be less accurate for certain types of soil or environmental conditions because they assume a linear relationship between the factors contributing to soil loss and the actual loss.

{"paragraph": "15.6.1 Empirical Formulas for Estimating Gully Erosion A number of equations have been calibrated for estimating gully erosion. The following was developed using data from western Iowa for severely gullied loessial areas: in which Y is the growth in the gully surface area (acres) for a given time period, X,i s an index of surface runoff (in.), X2i s the terraced area of the watershed (acres), X3 is the gully length at the beginning of the period (ft), X4 is the length from the end of the gully to the wa- tershed divide (ft), and X5 is the deviation of the precipitation (in.) from normal during the time period. Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 Another equation, which is based on data from a number of locations throughout the United States, is in which E, is the average annual gully head advance (ft), A is the drainage area (acres), S is the slope of approach at the channel (%), Po is the annual summation of rainfall (in.) from rains equal to or greater than 0.5 in. in 24 hr, and E, is the clay content of the eroding soil profile (percent by weight). A third equation is E, and A are the same as in the preceding equation, and P is the summation of 24-hr rainfall totals of 0.5 in. or more occurring during the time period, converted to an annual average basis (in.). Example 15-7 A 54-acre watershed, which is used for agricultural crops, has a length of 2350 ft and a slope of 1.1%. On the average, the annual summation of rainfall on days when the rainfall volume ex- ceeds 0.5 in. is 8.7 in. Soil tests indicate an average clay content of 24%.

According to the empirical formula, the clay content (E) is a key variable in estimating the average annual gully head advance. A higher clay content can lead to lower erosion rates, as clay soils tend to be more resistant to erosion than sandy or loamy soils. However, the exact relationship between clay content and gully erosion is complex and can be influenced by other factors such as rainfall, slope, and drainage area. For example, in areas with high rainfall and steep slopes, the effect of clay content on gully erosion may be less significant than in areas with low rainfall and gentle slopes.

Five factors underlie the variables used: land use, watershed size, gully size, soil type, and the momentum of the fluid. None of the equations have variables representing each factor. This is probably the result of the data bases. For example, Equation 15-17 is based on data for loessial areas, and thus variation due to soil type could not be assessed because the data was for one soil type only. All of the models are linear multiplicative or power models. Thus, if any of the vari- ables have zero values, the estimated gully erosion (Y or E,) will equal zero. This may not al- ways be true. For example, in Equation 15-17, if the terraced area of the watershed (1,i)s zero, the estimated value of the growth of gullied area (Y) is zero, which may or may not be true.

In English units, the equation is: in which q, is the bedload (lb/sec/ft), d is the effective grain diameter (ft), S, is the channel slope (ftlft), and q and q, are the water discharge rate and critical discharge rate (ft3/sec/ft), respectively. The critical discharge rate is The grain diameter d in Equations 15-34 and 15-35 is usually taken as the mean diameter, although this may not be exactly correct for soils having a nonuniform gradation.

This would be expected for a significant engineering problem such as erosion, sedimentation, and channel degradation. Given the large number of equations available, it is worthwhile to provide a brief comparison of the methods. This can be useful for assessing the quality of the models and for designing an analysis experiment to develop a new site-specific prediction equation. A number of impor- tant criteria could be identified for comparing the models; a list of the modeling criteria could include model structure, required input, comprehensiveness of the data base used to calibrate the equations, the potential accuracy of the equations, and the degree to which the empirical equations agree with theory. In addition to modeling criteria, criteria based on site characteristics should be used; this includes the availability and abundance of bed material, the grain size distribution of the bed material, and the relationship between the suspended load and bedload over the range of discharges of interest. Given the minimal detail that is available concerning the origin of many of these equations, it is necessary to compare the methods only on the basis of structure, input requirements, and the theoretical validity of the equations. If the objective was actually to select a model for prediction at a site, the other cri- teria (that is, data base and accuracy) would probably be the more important criteria.

Some models include terms that represent the difference above a threshold, such as the term (V - V,). These are the forms most commonly used when fitting the coefficients using regression analysis. Such a form is rational since field observations suggest that signif- icant bed movement does not occur until the velocity reaches a critical level. The prediction equations for computing bedload transport rates have some input vari- ables in common. However, for the purpose of comparison, it is best to identify the input re- quirements as belonging to one of three classes: flow parameters, soil particle parameters. and channel characteristics. For the eight prediction equations, four different flow parame- ters were used: water discharge rate, mean water velocity, mean flow depth, and the specific weight of the water. These parameters are interrelated by way of the continuity equation. (that is, pVA = pq = constant). Every equation uses at least one of the flow parameters, with one of the equations using three flow parameters. The eight equations used five different soil parameters: mean particle diameter, maxi- mum particle diameter, the weight distribution of bedload particles, the specific gravity of the sediment, and the critical velocity. These parameters are also interrelated. For example, the critical velocity is a function of the mean particle diameter. and the mean particle diame- ter is a function of the weight distribution of the sediment. All of the equations use at least one soil parameter, with five of the eight using more than one. While using more than one soil parameter in a prediction equation may only provide slight improvement in the accuracy of a prediction, it does provide the means for examining the relative effects of variation in the input. This may be considered an advantage as long as the intercorrelation between the soil parameters does not cause irrational coefficients when fitting the coefficients. Five of the eight equations include the channel slope as an input.

{"paragraph": "15.9.1 Development of Tractive Force Model A theoretical approach to stable channel design is designated the tractive force approach. The tractive force is simply the pull of the water on the wetted area of a channel. This force is produced when water flows in a channel and acts in the direction of flow. The term \"trac- tive force7'i s sometimes referred to as \"shear force\" or \"drag force.\" The tractive force the- ory is based on the fact that the stability of bed and bank material is a function of their ability to resist erosion resulting from the shear force exerted on them by the moving water. The value of the tractive force that is required to entrain a given grain is called the critical trac- tive force. The conceptual basis of the theory is to limit the unit tractive force that acts on the channel to the maximum value that will not cause serious erosion of the material forming the channel bed on a level surface. This value is termed the critical tractive force. The theoretical basis involves a balance of the forces that act in the channel. The idea of the tractive force concept was first introduced by DuBoys in 1879. Accord- ing to his findings, in a uniform flow, the tractive force (that is, average shear stress) is equal to the effective component of the gravity force acting on the water parallel to the channel bottom. This can be derived by considering the free body of a segment of the full width of a channel as shown in Figure 15-5. A summation of the forces, assuming steady flow condi- tions, is 7,. + + Fu Wsinci = Fd 7 P w L 0 (15-41) in which Fu and Fd are the upstream and downstream hydrostatic forces (F, = Fd for uniform flow), Pw is the wetter perimeter, W is the weight of the segment of fluid, a is the angle that the channel slope makes with the horizontal datum, Lo is the length of the free-body segment, and T is the average boundary shear that retards the flow. Assuming that F, = F,, Equation 15-41 can be rearranged to solve for the boundary shear: .W sin a FIGURE 15-5 Free-body diagram of segment of open-channel flow. 784 Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 By substituting yAL, for the weight Wand the slope S for sin a, Equation 15-42 reduces to the familiar form: where R, is the hydraulic radius and equals the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter. When the channel is very wide relative to the depth, the depth approximates the hydraulic radius, and the expression for average shear stress becomes where h is the depth of flow in the channel. It is important to realize that the unit tractive force in channels, except for very wide channels, is not uniformly distributed along the wetted perimeter. The distribution varies with channel shape. In practice, the actual tractive force never quite reaches the theoretical value of yhS. The maximum value is generated along the center of the bottom and is approx- imately 0.97 yhS. On the sides the maximum force occurs at about one-third of the water depth from the bottom and is approximately 0.75 yhS. The stress is zero at both bottom cor- ners as well as at the water surface. This is shown in Figure 15-6. Because of the difference in the magnitude of the tractive force exerted on the channel bed and sides, the shear stress is frequently designated as T~ for the unit tractive force on the side of the channel and TL for the unit tractive force on the level surface or bed of the chan- nel. Maintaining stability in channels of noncohesive soil is particularly difficult because of the tendency for grains to roll down the side slope due to the force of gravity. The analysis for the tractive force acting on the channel sides Ts can be performed by considering a parti- cle on the side slope of the channel (see Figure 15-7). By resolving the weight of the particle into two components, it is evident that the component parallel to the side, W, sin a, tends to roll the particle down the side of the channel while the component normal to the side, W, cos a, tends to hold the particle in place. The two forces responsible for movement of the particle are the tractive force a7, where a is the effective area of the particle, and the gravity force component W, sin a . The resultant (F,) of these two forces, which are at right angles to each other, is F, = [w: ( sin a)2 + a 2 T 2 ~ 0. ] 5 FIGURE 15-6 Distribution of shear stresses along a wetted perimeter. Sec. 15.9 Tractive Force Approach to Stable Channel Design The force that resists movement is equal to the normal force W, cos a multiplied by the coef- ficient of friction f (that is, tan $, where $ is the angle of repose): F,. = fW,cosa = Wscosatan$ (1 5 4 6 ) When the particle is in a state of impending motion, the forces are equal. Equating the forces yields + wS [(ws sin a)2 (a T,)~]~.=' cos a tan $ (15 -47) This can be solved for the unit tractive force that causes impending motion on a sloping sur- face: When motion of a particle on the level surface is impending due to the tractive force aTL, the following is obtained from Equation 1 5 4 8b y setting a = 0\": The ratio of to is called the tractive-force ratio (K,). This is often used in design and is 7, TL given by Approximating Equation 15-50 gives To apply Equations 1548 and 1549, information is required on the angle of repose ($). Ex- + tensive tests by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have shown that is dependent on the size and shape of the sediment as shown in Figure 15-8. According to studies by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the angle of repose needs to be considered only for coarse noncohesive materials because for cohesive and fine noncohesive materials, the cohesive forces become so great in proportion to the gravity force component that the gravity component can be safely neglected.

Sec. 15.9 Tractive Force Approach to Stable Channel Design 787 If only the relationship between the maximum unit tractive force on the side of the channel T~ and the maximum unit tractive force on the bed of the channel 7, need to be deter- mined, the ratio K can be used. This is often needed in design applications. Therefore, in- stead of determining the stress distribution along the channel as shown earlier, only the max- imum values of stress are determined. A value for K, of 1 is used for the bed, and a value of K less than 1 is used for the side slopes. Lane (Leliavsky, 1955) has prepared a diagram that shows the relationship between the angle of repose @, the slope angle a,a nd K (see Figure 15-9).

{"paragraph": "5.9.2 Critical Tractive Force When water flows through a channel, a shear stress is produced. This is referred to as the tractive force. As the flow velocity increases, the tractive force is increased until it reaches a value known as the critical tractive force, which occurs at the threshold of particle motion. Like many threshold conditions, an exact value cannot be precisely defined. At first, a grain or two becomes detached at a certain rate of flow. Then, as the flow rate increases, more grains become detached and are transported until the process is general over the whole bed. Hence, it is easy to understand the difficulty encountered in defining the exact state at which the critical tractive force is reached. The critical tractive force is the maximum unit shear force that will not cause serious erosion of the material forming the channel bed on a level surface. However, since this defin- ition is subject to the interpretation of the individual researcher, various equations have been presented, with little agreement among them. Schoklitsch contributed to the early develop- ments by presenting the following equation, which is based on his own experiments: where d is the mean grain diameter, A is a shape coefficient ranging from 1 for spheres to 4.4 for flat grains, and 7, is the critical tractive force (kg/m2). An improvement over Scho- klitsch's approach was later given by Tiffany et al. (1935), which was based on more experi- mental evidence and was thought to be a more representative equation: in which M is a grain distribution modulus and 7, is in g/m2. At a later date, Schoklitsch rean- alyzed his data and suggested two equations, which were dependent on particle size: 0.000285 (7, - y) dlm for 0.0001 m < d < 0.003 m (15-54a) 0.076 (ys - y) d for d 2 0.006 m (15-54b) A simpler relationship was presented by Leliavsky (1955), who believed that shear stress (g/m2) versus grain size is given by where the mean particle diameter d is given in millimeters. This equation fits most of his data quite well and is very simple to use.

This force is crucial in understanding the dynamics of sediment transport and channel stability."}, {"question": "How does the tractive force change as the flow velocity increases, and why is it challenging to define the exact critical tractive force?", "answer": "As the flow velocity increases, the tractive force also increases until it reaches the critical tractive force. Defining the exact critical tractive force is challenging because it is a threshold condition where initially, only a grain or two becomes detached, and as the flow rate increases, more grains become detached, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact state at which the critical tractive force is reached."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment transport, why are various equations presented for calculating the critical tractive force, and what are some of the factors these equations consider?", "answer": "Various equations are presented for calculating the critical tractive force because there is little agreement among researchers on a single definition or formula. These equations consider factors such as the mean grain diameter, shape coefficient, grain distribution modulus, and particle size.

This relationship simplifies the calculation of critical tractive force by directly linking it to the mean particle diameter, making it easier to use and apply in various hydrological contexts."}, {"question": "How does the critical tractive force concept apply to predicting erosion for various depths of flow, and what factors influence this prediction?", "answer": "The critical tractive force concept can be used to predict the particle sizes that are eroded for various depths of flow by comparing the actual tractive stress to the critical tractive stress. Factors such as the slope of the channel, hydraulic radius, and particle size influence this prediction. For instance, for a given slope and hydraulic radius, the diameter of the smallest particle that will move can be determined, illustrating how these factors interplay in determining erosion susceptibility."}, {"question": "In the context of channel erosion, why do silt and clay particles erode from an erodible bed for very small flow depths and rates, according to the provided example?", "answer": "Silt and clay particles erode from an erodible bed for very small flow depths and rates because their critical diameters are very small, requiring minimal tractive force to initiate motion. This is evident from the tabular summary, which shows that silt and clay particles have very low hydraulic radii at which they will move, indicating that even shallow flow depths can cause their erosion. This highlights the vulnerability of fine-grained sediments to erosion, even under low-flow conditions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the critical tractive force concept for understanding sediment yield and channel stability, and how does it relate to hydrological processes?", "answer": "The critical tractive force concept has significant implications for understanding sediment yield and channel stability. It helps in predicting the onset of erosion and the transport of sediments, which is crucial for managing water resources and mitigating the effects of erosion. The concept is closely related to hydrological processes such as runoff, flow velocity, and sediment transport, as it influences the dynamics of channel morphology and the distribution of sediments within a watershed. Understanding the critical tractive force is essential for developing strategies to prevent or control erosion and for maintaining the health and stability of riverine ecosystems."}, {"question": "How do the equations for critical tractive force, such as those presented by Schoklitsch and Tiffany et al., differ in their approach and application?", "answer": "The equations for critical tractive force differ in their approach and application.

{"paragraph": "15.10 ESTIMATING SEDIMENT YIELD Erosion occurs both on the watershed and in the channel network. The total amount of mate- rial eroded is called the gross erosion. Not all of this material is transported throughout the watershed system. Much of the material will be deposited or trapped. That part of the gross erosion that is transported to a downstream control point such as a reservoir is called the sed- iment yield. Just as developers of small tracts of land must contend with on-site erosion, those involved with in-stream development, such as dams and diversion structures, must contend with the sediment yield. The problem of analysis can be separated into two categories: analysis for a single site and regionalization for estimation at ungaged sites. While the latter is the more com- mon problem, the former may be necessary for major projects. The results for the single- site analysis have limited use for other sites, unless the results are being used for a nearby watershed that is quite similar to the watershed where the sediment yield data were col- lected; in this case, the process is an extrapolation of data and one would expect a lower level of accuracy. In a sense, the spatial translation of a sediment yield estimation method from one watershed to a nearby watershed represents a form of regionalization with a sam- ple size of 1. Where it is necessary to make estimates of sediment yield at the site of a proposed structure, estimates can be synthesized using a number of methods: (1) analysis of measured data after installing one or more sediment-load measuring stations, (2) use of a regional sedi- ment yield equation, and (3) use of a sediment delivery ratio with estimated amounts of wa- tershed erosion. The first method has the disadvantages of requiring the initiation of a sedi- ment load measuring program and the delay in construction necessitated by such a program. Use of a regional equation relies on the similarity of the erosion/sedimentation characteris- tics of the watershed contributing at the design point with those watersheds used in develop- ing the regional method. The accuracy of estimates obtained using the third method depends on the representativeness of the equations used to predict watershed erosion and the accuracy of the sediment delivery ratio. 790 Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of sediment yield estimation, what is the difference between gross erosion and sediment yield?", "answer": "Gross erosion refers to the total amount of material eroded, while sediment yield is the part of the gross erosion that is transported to a downstream control point, such as a reservoir."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to estimate sediment yield for a single site and then apply it to other sites?", "answer": "Estimating sediment yield for a single site has limited use for other sites because the results are highly specific to the watershed where the data were collected.

{"paragraph": "15.10.1 Flow-Duration, Sediment-Rating-Curve Procedure The flow-duration, sediment-rating-curve procedure requires a flow-duration curve, a sediment rating curve, and knowledge of the characteristics of the sediment; both the flow-duration and sediment rating curves must be developed from on-site measurements, usually measurements made as part of a historic record at sites within the watershed. A flow-duration curve is the graphical relationship between the flow rate and the duration of time that the flow is equaled or exceeded; flow-duration data can be computed and plotted as a flow-frequency curve. Construction of a sediment rating curve requires records of both average daily dis- charge and sediment loads. The rating curve is developed by constructing a \"best fit\" line through a plot of the average daily flow and the corresponding sediment load. It is important to have a number of high flow measurements as part of the record to improve the accuracy of computed sediment yields. The sediment yield can be estimated by integrating the flow- duration and sediment rating curves. Given a daily discharge frequency curve and a daily sediment discharge rating curve, the following procedure can be used to estimate the sediment yield: 1. Separate the exceedence probability scale of the frequency curve into intervals; ap- proximately 20 or 25 intervals should be used. The intervals are usually not selected using a constant increment of probability. 2. Compute the range of each probability interval. 3. Compute the midpoint of each interval. 4. Using the discharge frequency curve, find the discharge that corresponds to each mid- point of Step 3. 5. Using the sediment rating curve, find the daily sediment discharge for each water dis- charge of Step 4. 6. Compute the expected sediment discharge as the product of the probability interval of Step 2 and the sediment discharge of Step 5. 7. Compute the total sediment as the product of the number of days in the year and the sum of the expected sediment discharges of Step 6. 8. Compute the sediment yield by dividing by the drainage area and making the necessary conversion of units. Example 15-12 For this example, the assumption is made that flood frequency data and sediment discharge data are available, with both the water and sediment discharge data available on a daily average basis. A daily mean discharge frequency curve can be developed using the methods presented in Chap- ter 5. For this example, we will assume that the record of daily discharges resulted in a log- normal population with a log,, mean of 3.8 and a log,, standard deviation of 0.2. We will also assume that the sediment rating curve is in which q, is the sediment discharge (tonslday) and q is the mean daily discharge (ft3/sec).

As shown in column 1 of Table 15-7, the probability scale was divided into 10 intemals; in practice, 20 to 25 is recommended, with the intervals being smaller for the small exceedence probabilities. The frequency interval and the midpoint of the intervals are given in columns 2 and 3. The mean daily discharge can be computed mathematically or ob- tained from the frequency curve for each midpoint in column 3; the discharges are given in col- umn 4 of Table 15-7 for the assumed log-normal population. The sediment rating curve of Equation 15-56 is used with the water discharges of column 4 to compute the corresponding sediment discharges, which are given in column 5. The expected sediment discharge is the prod- uct of the probability interval of column 2 and the sediment discharge of column 5. Once the ex- pected sediment discharge has been computed for each frequency interval, the sum can be deter- mined. The sediment yield in weight per unit area per year can be determined by multiplying by the number of days per year and dividing by the drainage area. Table 15-7 indicates a sum of 223,370 tonslday. Assuming the data is for a 17,100 mi2 watershed, the sediment yield is which is 7.45 tonslacrelyr. 15.10,2 Univariate Analysis of Reservoir Sediment Accumulation Records The univariate approach is useful where values for independent variables are not available. Basically, the method uses sediment accumulation for existing reservoirs to compute a re- gional mean sediment yield value. The mean is assumed to be valid for all similar locations in the region. The sediment yield (Y) equals the ratio of the accumulation (A,) to the trap effi- ciency (Ef)o f the reservoir: Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15 Given that the total accumulation in any one reservoir will be a function of the number of years in which the reservoir has been in operation and that the reservoirs in the region will have been in operation for different periods of time, the accumulation of A, of Equation 15-58 should be expressed in weight per area per unit time, such as tons per acre per year; that is, a common time frame should be used. The trap efficiencies for each reservoir will have to be determined from measurements or estimated using regionalized curves (see Sec- tion 15.10.6). Having computed estimates of the sediment yield for each existing reservoir, a weighted mean sediment yield can be computed by weighting the sediment yield from each site by the number of years of record: Y in which is the mean sediment yield for the region, nii s the number of years of accumula- tion at site i, Yii s the average annual sediment yield at site i, and m is the number of existing Y reservoirs. The computed value of is then the value of the regional sediment yield. To use - Y for any other site in the region, the average annual accumulation can be found by rearrang- Y ing Equation 15-58, using in place of Y, to solve for A,: Equation 15-60 will give the accumulation in weight per unit area per unit time, such as tonslacrelyear. The total accumulation per year is computed by multiplying by the drainage area. The expected accumulation over the design life of the reservoir is then obtained by multiplying by the number of years (that is, the design life): Example 15-13 The data for calculating the regional sediment yield of a hypothetical region are shown in Table 15-8. Total accumulations (A,,) in tons (x104) are given for seven reservoirs. For the drainage areas and years of accumulation, the unit accumulations (A,) in t~ns/mi'/~arr e computed for each site i. The sediment yield (Y,) for each site is calculated using the trap efficiencies and Equation 15-58. The regional estimate of the mean annual sediment yield is given by Equation 15-59: TABLE 15-8 Regional Sediment Yield Data for Example 15-13 Ati i' Area A i Ei Yi Site (tons x lo4) (yr) (mi2) (ton~/mi~/~r) (tons/mi2/yr) Sec. 15.10 Estimating Sediment Yield 793 For a proposed reservoir with a contributing area of 255 mi2 and a trap efficiency of 52%, the (A,) expected accumulation would be: The total expected accumulation for the project life could be found by multiplying the accumula- tion (53,836 tonslyr) by the project life in years. Limitations. This method has a number of limitations. Obviously, errors can be in- troduced when the method involves extrapolation. Extrapolation occurs when the method is used outside the range of the data used to compute the mean annual sediment yield. The drainage area and trap efficiencies should not be much different from the values in the data set. For example, the trap efficiency is usually proportional to the size of the reservoir, with the larger reservoir having a greater retention time and therefore the opportunity for deposi- tion.

{"paragraph": "15.10.3 Multiple Variable Analysis of Reservoir Sediment Accumulation Records For the previous analysis, the sediment accumulation in a reservoir was treated as a single variable, and the use of Equation 15-60 assumes that the analysis is univariate. The drainage area was only used as a scaling factor to compute the yield per unit area. As indicated previ- ously, one would expect both the sediment yield and the trap efficiency to be a function of variables such as the drainage area. One would expect that if variation in the sediment yield with drainage area were more properly accounted for, the accuracy of estimated sediment yields would be improved. The procedure for making a multiple variable analysis is to relate the sediment yields, Y ,i n Equation 15-59 to the drainage areas using a bivariate regression analysis. Graphically, the relationship can be seen using a plot of Yiv ersus the drainage area of site i. If a simple bi- variate regression analysis is used to compute the best-fit line, the record length at each reservoir site is ignored. This problem can be overcome using a weighted least squares pro- cedure, with the record length used as the weighting factor. The best-fit line can then be used to estimate the sediment yield for the site of a proposed structure.

First, watersheds in which significant changes have occurred, such as forest fires, surface mining activity, or overgrazing of livestock, should not be used; in such cases, the sediment accumulated in the reservoirs may not be in- dicative of sediment yield from a natural watershed. Second, the fitting of a curve between Yi and A, represents a case involving ratio correlation, which should usually be avoided. Specifically, the value of Yi depends on the value of A,, so when Yi is plotted versus Ai, part of the variation in Yi is a function of the inverse of Ai. Obviously, a graph of YA, versus A, could provide near-perfect correlation. The effect of such analysis should be investigated.

{"paragraph": "15.10.4 Estimation Using Sediment Delivery Ratios As indicated previously, all of the soil eroded in the upper reaches of a watershed will not be delivered to a point downstream. Much of the material will be redeposited at locations where the momentum of the transporting water is insufficient to keep the material in suspension or Sec. 15.10 Estimating Sediment Yield 795 to move the soil particles along the watershed surface or channel. This is most likely to occur in areas of low slope or high roughness. The ratio of the sediment transported to a location in the channel system (that is, the sediment yield) to the gross erosion from the drainage area above that point is called the sediment delivery ratio. The sediment delivery ratio is a func- tion of the following factors: 1. The sediment source (watershed versus channel) 2. The magnitude and proximity of the sediment source (the erodibility of remote areas of the watershed versus that at sites near the design location) 3. Characteristics of the transport system (channel density, condition, and gradient) 4. The frequency, duration, and intensity of erosion-producing storms 5. Characteristics of soil material such as texture 6. The potential for deposition such as at the base of slopes and at storage, natural or man-made, sites within the channel system 7. Watershed characteristics such as the area, slope, and shape To use the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) concept for estimating sediment yields at un- gaged sites, it is necessary to have (1) a method of estimating the SDR for that site, and (2) es- timates of watershed and' channel erosion for all subareas of the watershed.

{"paragraph": "15.10.5 Sediment Routing with Sediment Delivery Ratios It is often necessary in hydrologic analysis to subdivide a watershed because of a lack of ho- mogeneity of watershed characteristics, such as land cover, slope, or soil type. When a wa- tershed is subdivided, the process of subdivision must be considered when using sediment delivery ratios. The concept of a SDR assumes a homogeneous watershed. Methods for esti- mating a SDR often use a single variable such as drainage area as the only predictor variable even though a SDR is affected by many watershed characteristics. Two of the equations of Table 15-9 suggest that slope is an important variable. When a sediment delivery ratio that is based on a simplified equation is used for prediction, the SDR concept can be misapplied. Boyce (1975) identifies a problem in using the SDR concept for sediment routing. Consider the watershed of Figure 15-1 1. The 3-mi' watershed consists of three equal sub- areas (Al = A, = A, = 1 mi2). Subareas 1 and 2 are upland areas, while subarea 3 is an alluvial area with a smaller mean slope than the slopes of the upland subareas. Using the first equa- tion of Table 15-9 to estimate the SDR for the total watershed provides SDR = 35.8%. Using the same equation for the 1-mi' subareas yields SDR = 43.4%. Assuming a gross erosion of 100 tons/mi21yr from each subarea, the gross erosion for the watershed would be 300 tonslyr. Using the SDR of 0.358 gives a sediment yield of 107.4 tonslyr. However, if the SDR con- cept is applied to the individual subareas, the total sediment yield would be 3(100)(0.434) = 130.2 tonslyr. Which is correct, 107.4 or 130.2 tonslyr? The concept of a SDR assumes that the watershed is homogeneous in its capacity to deliver sediment to the design point. If each subarea is generating equal amounts of gross erosion, the SDR of 0.434 would be correct. But for the low-sloped subarea (number 3) the yield is less. Using an SDR of 0.434 for sub- areas I and 2 and a total sediment yield of 107.4 tonslyr for the entire watershed, then for the flow-through subarea 3 the actual SDR is 107.4 2 (0.434) (100) - SDR, = = 0.206 100 FIGURE 15-1 1 Schematic diagram of watershed for sediment routing with sediment delivery ratios. Sec. 15.10 Estimating Sediment Yield 797 Thus the total yield of 107.4 tonslyr to the mouth of the watershed is the result of sediment yields of 43.4 tonslyr from each of the two upland subareas to the confluence and 20.6 tonslyr for the low-sloped, flow-through subarea to the watershed outlet. Even this may seem irrational because one typically expects larger yields from the subareas located closest to the watershed outlet. Example 15-15 The equation from Table 15-9 for drainage areas less than 10 mi2 for midwestern watersheds can be used as an illustration of sediment yield calculations. Assume a sediment analysis is being made for a 0.7 mi2 watershed in the midwest. For illustration purposes, we can assume that land erosion of agricultural lands is the predominant source of sediment and that a detailed ero- sion analysis of the watershed using the USLE provides an annual erosion of 1570 tonslyr. This annual load represents the soil lost from individual fields, but not the total load at the outlet of the 0.7 mi2 watershed. Because of within-watershed deposition, the annual yield at the outlet is computed as the product of the load that is computed with the USLE and the sediment delivery ratio, which is computed using the equation in Table 15-9: yield = 1570 [43.4 (0.7) -0.1753]/100 = 1570 (0.462) = 725 tons/yr Thus, slightly less tKan one-half of the eroded soil will pass out of the watershed. Example 15-16 The sediment delivery ratio computed with the equation used in Example 15-15 is sensitive to the accuracy of the estimate of the drainage area. Error in the drainage area estimate will cause error in the computed sediment delivery ratio and thus the sediment yield. The sensitivity of the SDR to drainage area can be found by taking the derivative of the SDR equation: A sensitivity estimate from Equation 15-69 has units of %/mi2. The negative sensitivity in- dicates that, as the drainage area increases, the sensitivity decreases. For a drainage area of 0.1 mi2, Equation 15-69 yields a sensitivity of -1 13.9, while a sensitivity of -7.61 results in a drainage area of 1.O mi2. An error of 0.01 mi2 for a drainage area of 0.1 mi2 will cause an error in the SDR of [ ] d (SDR) SDR = dA AA = - 113.9 (0.01) = - 1.14% For a drainage area of 1 mi2, the error in the SDR would be SDR = -7.61 (0.01) = - 0.761% (1 5-7 1) Using the values from Example 15-15, Equation 15-69 gives a sensitivity of -1 1.6%/mi2 for a drainage area of 0.7 mi2. Thus, for an error in the drainage area of 0.01 mi2, the SDR will have an error of -1 1.6(0.01) = -0.116%, with the negative sign indicating that the SDR would de- crease for a positive error in the drainage area. Thus, if the actual area was 0.68, the SDR would change by approximately (- 11.6%/mi2) (- 0.02 mi') = 0.232% 798 Erosion and Sedimentation Chap. 15", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of sediment routing, why is it necessary to subdivide a watershed?", "answer": "It is necessary to subdivide a watershed because of the lack of homogeneity of watershed characteristics, such as land cover, slope, or soil type, which affects the application of sediment delivery ratios."}, {"question": "How does the concept of a Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) account for variations in watershed characteristics?", "answer": "The concept of SDR assumes a homogeneous watershed, but methods for estimating SDR often use a single variable, such as drainage area, as the only predictor variable, even though SDR is affected by many watershed characteristics, including slope, as suggested by some equations."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment yield calculations, what is the implication of using a simplified equation for SDR that does not account for variations in watershed characteristics?", "answer": "Using a simplified equation for SDR that does not account for variations in watershed characteristics can lead to misapplication of the SDR concept, resulting in incorrect sediment yield calculations. For example, in a watershed with different subareas having distinct characteristics, applying a single SDR value can lead to discrepancies in sediment yield estimates, as illustrated in the example where the total sediment yield was calculated as 107.4 tons/yr using the SDR for the total watershed, but would be 130.2 tons/yr if the SDR concept is applied to individual subareas. This discrepancy highlights the importance of considering the heterogeneity of watershed characteristics when applying the SDR concept."}, {"question": "Why does the sediment delivery ratio decrease as the drainage area increases, according to the sensitivity analysis?", "answer": "The sediment delivery ratio decreases as the drainage area increases because the sensitivity of the SDR to drainage area, as indicated by the derivative of the SDR equation, is negative. This means that as the drainage area increases, the rate of change of the SDR with respect to the drainage area decreases, resulting in a lower SDR for larger drainage areas. For instance, the sensitivity analysis shows that for a drainage area of 0.1 mi^2, a small error in the drainage area estimate can cause a significant error in the SDR, whereas for a larger drainage area of 1 mi^2, the same error would result in a much smaller error in the SDR."}, {"question": "How does the accuracy of the drainage area estimate affect the sediment delivery ratio and sediment yield calculations?", "answer": "The accuracy of the drainage area estimate significantly affects the sediment delivery ratio and sediment yield calculations. An error in the drainage area estimate can cause an error in the computed sediment delivery ratio, which in turn affects the sediment yield. The sensitivity analysis shows that the error in the SDR due to an error in the drainage area estimate decreases as the drainage area increases. For example, an error of 0.01 mi^2 in a drainage area of 0.1 mi^2 can cause an error of -1.14% in the SDR, whereas the same error in a drainage area of 1 mi^2 would result in a much smaller error of -0.761% in the SDR.

However, this annual load does not account for within-watershed deposition, and therefore, the sediment delivery ratio is used to compute the actual sediment yield at the outlet of the watershed. The USLE estimate is then multiplied by the sediment delivery ratio to obtain the sediment yield, as illustrated in Example 15-15, where the annual erosion of 1570 tons/yr is multiplied by the SDR of 0.462 to give a sediment yield of 725 tons/yr."}, {"question": "How does the sediment delivery ratio concept account for the differences in sediment yield between upland and low-sloped subareas?", "answer": "The sediment delivery ratio concept accounts for the differences in sediment yield between upland and low-sloped subareas by recognizing that the SDR is not uniform across the watershed.
