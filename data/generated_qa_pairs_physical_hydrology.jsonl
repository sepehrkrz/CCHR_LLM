{"paragraph": "1.1 Definition and Scope of Hydrology Hydrology  is  the  geoscience  that  describes  and predicts the occurrence and circulation of the earth’s fresh water. The principal focus of hydrology includes: • the distribution and movement of water substance on  and  under  the  earth’s  land  surfaces,  including its exchanges with the atmosphere; • its  physical  and  chemical  interactions  with  earth materials; and • the biological processes and human activities that affect its movement, distribution, and quality. The  circulation  of  water  on  land  occurs  in  the context  of  the  cycle,  which  in- global  hydrologic cludes  the  spatial  and  temporal  variations  of  water substance in the oceanic and atmospheric as well as the terrestrial compartments of the global water sys- tem (figure 1.1). Thus, the study of the global hydro- logic  cycle  is  included  in  the  scope  of  hydrology (Eagleson et al. 1991). The hydrologic cycle is a cen- tral  component  of  the  earth’s  climate  system  at  all scales, from local to global (Peixoto and Oort 1992). Figure 1.2 shows the major storage components and flows  of  the  global hydrologic  cycle,  and  figure 1.3 (on p. 5) shows the storages and flows of energy Hydrology Basic Concepts and Challenges and water that constitute the land phase of the cycle. Figure 1.4 (on p. 6) gives a quantitative sense of the range of time and space scales in the domain of hy- drologic science. Figure 1.5 (on p. 6) shows the position of hydro- logic science in the spectrum from basic sciences to water-resource management. Hydrology is an inher- ently interdisciplinary geoscience, built upon the ba- sic sciences of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and upon its sister geosciences. Much of the motivation  for  answering  hydrologic  questions  has and will continue to come from the practical need to manage  water  resources  and  water-related  hazards.

While  there  are  no  exceptions  to  the  require- ment  of  dimensional  homogeneity,  there  are  some important qualifications: • Dimensional homogeneity is a necessary but not a sufficient requirement for correctly and completely describing a physical relation. • Equations  that  are  not  dimensionally  homoge- neous can be very useful approximations of physi- cal relationships. This  latter  situation  arises  because  the  magni- tudes  of  hydrologic  quantities  are  commonly  deter- mined  by  the  complex  interaction  of  many  factors, and  it  is  often  virtually  impossible  to  formulate  the physically correct equation or to measure all the rele- vant  independent  variables.  Thus,  hydrologists  are often forced to develop and rely on relatively simple (i.e.,  equations  based  on  ob- empirical  equations served  relations  between  measured  quantities)  that may  be  dimensionally  inhomogeneous.  Often,  such equations are developed via the statistical process of regression analysis. Finally, it is important to recog- nize that Equations can be dimensionally homogeneous but not unitarily homogeneous. (However, all unitarily homogeneous equations are of course dimensionally homogeneous.) This situation can arise because each system of units As  noted,  dimensionally  and/or  unitarily  inho- mogeneous  empirical  equations  are  frequently  en- countered in hydrology. Because of this: Chapter 1 • The  practicing  hydrologist  should  check  every equation for dimensional and unitary homogeneity. • The  units  of  each  variable  in  an  inhomogeneous equation MUST be specified. • If you want to change the units used in an inhomo- geneous equation, at least one of the coefficients or constants must change. The above rules are crucial because If you use an inhomogeneous equation with units other than those for which it was given, you will get the wrong answer. Surprisingly,  it  is  not  uncommon  in  the  earth  sci- ences  and  engineering  literature  to  encounter  inho- mogeneous  equations  for  which  units  are  not specified—so caveat calculator! In  practice,  there  are  often  situations  in  which we  want  to  use  an  inhomogeneous  equation  with quantities  measured  in  units  different  from  those used in developing it.

An important concomitant of viscos- ity  is  the  condition:  the  flow  velocity  at  a stationary boundary is always zero, so that any flow near a boundary experiences a velocity gradient per- pendicular  to  the  boundary.  At  small  spatial  scales (centimeter scale or less) and low flow velocities (less than a few cm/s), viscous resistance controls the gra- dient and the rate of flow. However—and somewhat surprisingly—the vis- cosity  of  water  is  low  compared  to  other  fluids  be- cause  of the rapidity with which the intermolecular hydrogen bonds break and reform (about once every 10−12 s). Thus, as flow scales and velocities increase, inertial effects soon dominate the effects of viscosity, so  that  formerly  straight  or  smoothly  curving  flow paths  become  increasingly  chaotic  due  to  eddies. This phenomenon, called turbulence, produces a re- sistance to flow that  depends on  the  flow scale and velocity,  and  is  typically  orders  of  magnitude  larger than  that  due  to  viscosity.  Hence,  the  physical  rela- tions describing subsurface flow in soil pores, where viscosity  usually  dominates,  and  in  surface  flows, where turbulence dominates, are very different.

In  subsurface  flows,  is  the soil-pore diameter and flows with Re < 1 are domi- nated by viscous resistance; in open-channel flows, L is the flow depth and flows with Re < 500 are domi- nated by viscous resistance.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of fluid dynamics, what is viscosity and how does it affect the flow of liquid water?", "answer": "Viscosity is the internal intermolecular friction that resists motion of a fluid. It affects the flow of liquid water by creating resistance, especially at small spatial scales and low flow velocities, where viscous resistance controls the gradient and rate of flow. This resistance is due to the intermolecular forces between water molecules, but the viscosity of water is relatively low because the hydrogen bonds between molecules break and reform rapidly."}, {"question": "How does the scale and velocity of flow influence the dominance of viscosity versus turbulence in water flow?", "answer": "As flow scales and velocities increase, inertial effects soon dominate the effects of viscosity, leading to the phenomenon of turbulence. This is because at larger scales and higher velocities, the rapid breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonds between water molecules become less significant compared to the inertial forces, resulting in chaotic flow paths and eddies that produce a resistance to flow much larger than that due to viscosity."}, {"question": "In the context of subsurface flows, why is viscous resistance typically more significant than turbulent resistance?", "answer": "Viscous resistance is more significant in subsurface flows because these flows occur at small spatial scales, such as within soil pores, where the flow velocities are also typically low. Under these conditions, the Reynolds number (Re) is less than 1, indicating that viscous forces dominate over inertial forces, and thus, the flow is characterized by smooth, laminar paths rather than chaotic, turbulent ones."}, {"question": "What is the Reynolds number, and how does it reflect the relative importance of turbulent and viscous resistance in a flow?", "answer": "The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity that reflects the relative importance of turbulent and viscous resistance in a flow. It is calculated using the formula Re = ρUL/μ, where ρ is the mass density, U is the average velocity, L is a characteristic length scale (such as soil-pore diameter in subsurface flows or flow depth in open-channel flows), and μ is the dynamic viscosity. A low Reynolds number (e.g., Re < 1 in subsurface flows or Re < 500 in open-channel flows) indicates that viscous resistance dominates, while a high Reynolds number suggests that turbulent resistance is more significant."}, {"question": "Why does the viscosity of water have a relatively low value compared to other fluids?", "answer": "The viscosity of water is relatively low because of the rapidity with which the intermolecular hydrogen bonds break and reform, occurring about once every 10−12 seconds. This rapid breaking and reforming reduce the internal friction between water molecules, resulting in lower viscosity compared to fluids where such bonds are stronger or more stable."}, {"question": "In the context of open-channel flows, how does the flow depth influence the nature of the flow in terms of turbulence?", "answer": "In open-channel flows, the flow depth (L) is a critical factor in determining the nature of the flow. For flows with a Reynolds number less than 500, viscous resistance dominates, and the flow is likely to be smooth and laminar. However, as the flow depth increases or the average velocity increases, the Reynolds number can exceed 500, leading to a dominance of turbulent resistance. This results in chaotic flow paths and eddies, significantly affecting the flow's behavior and resistance."}, {"question": "How do the physical relations describing subsurface flow in soil pores differ from those in surface flows?", "answer": "The physical relations describing subsurface flow in soil pores differ significantly from those in surface flows because of the dominance of different forces in each context. In subsurface flows, viscosity usually dominates due to the small spatial scales and low velocities, leading to laminar flow. In contrast, surface flows are often characterized by higher velocities and larger scales, resulting in the dominance of turbulence. This difference necessitates the use of distinct mathematical models and approaches to accurately describe and predict flow behavior in these two environments."}, {"question": "What implications does the transition from viscous to turbulent flow have for understanding and modeling water flow in hydrological systems?", "answer": "The transition from viscous to turbulent flow has significant implications for understanding and modeling water flow in hydrological systems. It suggests that different physical processes and mathematical models may be required to accurately describe flow behavior under various conditions. For instance, in subsurface flows, models that account for viscous resistance may be appropriate, while in surface flows, models that incorporate turbulent resistance may be more suitable. This transition also highlights the complexity and variability of hydrological systems, where flow conditions can change rapidly, affecting the overall behavior and response of the system to different inputs and disturbances. Understanding and capturing this variability is crucial for predicting water flow, managing water resources, and mitigating the impacts of hydrological extremes."}]}

Its dimensions are energy per mass, [E M−1], or [L2 T−2]. The term “latent” is used because no tem- perature change is associated with the gain or loss of heat. The large amounts of energy required to break hydrogen bonds during melting and vaporization, and which are released by the formation of bonds during freezing and condensation, make water’s latent heats very large relative to other substances. The latent heat of fusion is the quantity of heat energy that is added or released when a unit mass of substance melts or freezes. For water, this is a signifi- cant  quantity,  3.34  KJ/kg.  Latent  heat  of  fusion plays an important role in the dynamics of freezing and thawing of water bodies and of water in the soil: Once  the  temperature  is  raised  or  lowered  to  0°C, this heat must be conducted to or from the melting/ freezing site in order to sustain the melting or freez- ing process. The latent heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat energy that is added or released when a unit mass of substance vaporizes or condenses.

{"paragraph": "1.7.1 Definition Hydrologists  commonly  apply  the  conservation equation in the form of a water-balance equation to a geographical  region  in  order  to  establish  the  basic hydrologic  characteristics  of  the  region.  Most  com- monly, the region is a watershed: A watershed (also called drainage basin, river basin, or catchment) is the area that topographically appears to contribute all the water that passes through a specified cross section of a stream (the outlet) (figure 1.10). The surface trace of the boundary that delimits a watershed is called a divide. The horizontal projection of the area of a watershed is called the drainage area of the stream at (or above) the outlet. The watershed concept is of fundamental impor- tance because it can usually be assumed that at least most  of  the  water  passing  through  the  stream  cross section at the watershed outlet originates as precipi- tation  on  the  watershed,  and  the  characteristics  of the  watershed  control  the  paths  and  rates  of  move- ment of water as it moves over or under the surface to the stream network. To the extent this is true, Watershed geology, soils, topography, and land use determine the magnitude, timing, and quality of streamflow and ground-water outflow. Thus, the watershed can be viewed as a natural land- scape  unit,  integrated  by  water  flowing through  the Hydrology: Basic Concepts and Challenges land  phase  of  the  hydrologic  cycle  and,  as  William Morris Davis (1899, p. 495) stated, “One may fairly extend the ‘river’ all over its [watershed] and up to its very divides. Ordinarily treated, the river is like the veins of a leaf; broadly viewed, it is like the entire leaf.” Although  political  boundaries  do  not  generally follow  watershed  boundaries,  water-resource  and land-use  planning  agencies  recognize  that  effective management of water quality and quantity requires a watershed  perspective.  At  the  same  time,  it  must  be recognized that there are places in which topographi- cally defined watershed divides do not coincide with the boundaries of ground-water flow systems; this is especially likely to occur in arid regions where topog- raphy is subdued and underlain by highly porous ma- terials (e.g., Saudi Arabia, portions of the US Great Plains). This is discussed further in section 1.8.2.3.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrology, what is the primary purpose of applying the conservation equation to a geographical region?", "answer": "The primary purpose is to establish the basic hydrologic characteristics of the region, commonly through a water-balance equation."}, {"question": "How do hydrologists define a watershed, and what is its significance in hydrology?", "answer": "A watershed is defined as the area that topographically appears to contribute all the water that passes through a specified cross section of a stream, with its significance lying in controlling the paths and rates of water movement, thus determining the magnitude, timing, and quality of streamflow and groundwater outflow."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed management, why is it essential to consider the watershed as a natural landscape unit integrated by water flowing through the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "Considering the watershed as a natural landscape unit is essential because it allows for the understanding of how watershed geology, soils, topography, and land use determine the characteristics of streamflow and groundwater outflow, which is crucial for effective water-resource and land-use planning. This perspective recognizes that water flowing through the landscape integrates various components, making the watershed a fundamental unit for managing water quality and quantity. Furthermore, this approach aligns with the concept that the watershed can be viewed as an extension of the river itself, as stated by William Morris Davis, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the landscape and the hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "How do political boundaries relate to watershed boundaries, and what implications does this have for water-resource management?", "answer": "Political boundaries do not generally follow watershed boundaries, which implies that effective management of water quality and quantity requires a watershed perspective that transcends political boundaries. This discrepancy highlights the need for water-resource and land-use planning agencies to adopt a watershed-based approach, recognizing the hydrologic unity of the landscape despite political divisions. In practice, this means that management strategies must consider the entire watershed, including areas that may fall under different political jurisdictions, to ensure comprehensive and effective water management."}, {"question": "In arid regions, why may topographically defined watershed divides not coincide with the boundaries of groundwater flow systems?", "answer": "In arid regions, topographically defined watershed divides may not coincide with the boundaries of groundwater flow systems because the subdued topography and highly porous materials underlying these regions can lead to groundwater flow patterns that do not strictly follow surface topographic boundaries. This discrepancy is particularly notable in areas such as Saudi Arabia and portions of the US Great Plains, where the geology and hydrology are characterized by high permeability, allowing groundwater to move more freely and independently of surface drainage patterns. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for accurate groundwater management and modeling in such regions."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the concept that \"one may fairly extend the 'river' all over its watershed and up to its very divides,\" as stated by William Morris Davis?", "answer": "The concept signifies that the river and its watershed are intimately connected, with the watershed being an integral part of the river system. This perspective emphasizes the holistic nature of hydrologic processes, suggesting that the river is not just a channel but an integral part of the landscape that includes its entire drainage area. This understanding is fundamental for managing water resources effectively, as it recognizes the river and its watershed as a single, interconnected system that requires comprehensive management strategies."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic cycle, how does the watershed control the paths and rates of water movement?", "answer": "The watershed controls the paths and rates of water movement through its geology, soils, topography, and land use, which determine how water flows over or under the surface to the stream network. The characteristics of the watershed, such as its slope, permeability, and vegetation cover, influence the infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge, thereby affecting the timing and magnitude of streamflow and groundwater outflow. This control is critical for understanding and predicting hydrologic responses to various factors, including precipitation, land use changes, and climate variability."}, {"question": "Why is the watershed concept of fundamental importance in hydrology, and what are its implications for water-resource management?", "answer": "The watershed concept is of fundamental importance because it can usually be assumed that most of the water passing through a stream cross section at the watershed outlet originates as precipitation on the watershed. This assumption allows hydrologists to understand and predict the hydrologic behavior of the watershed, including the magnitude, timing, and quality of streamflow and groundwater outflow. The implications for water-resource management are significant, as the watershed perspective enables the development of effective strategies for managing water quality and quantity, taking into account the integrated nature of the hydrologic cycle and the interconnectedness of the landscape. By recognizing the watershed as a natural landscape unit, water-resource managers can adopt a more holistic approach to managing water resources, considering the complex interactions between hydrologic processes, geology, soils, topography, and land use."}]}

{"paragraph": "1.7.2.2 Digital Delineation In  recent  years  there  has  been  a  rapid  develop- ment of readily accessible and generally reliable digi- tal  tools  for  watershed  delineation.  These  are  based on digital elevation models (DEMs), which are com- puter  data  files  that  give  land-surface  elevations  at grid points. The DEM elevations are based on radar reflections  collected  by  satellite.  The  original  data usually  contain  many  errors  due  to  false  readings from vegetation, areas of radar shadowing by topog- raphy,  lack  of  reflections  from  water  surfaces,  and other effects.

Unless there are obvious reasons for thinking oth- erwise (e.g., melting of glaciers, construction of large reservoirs, large-scale water transfers in or out, exten- sive pumping and export of ground water), it is com- monly assumed that water storage is not significantly increasing  or  decreasing  over  time,  so  that    ≈  0. And, because watersheds are topographically defined and  ground-water  flow  is  driven  by  gravity  (section 8.2), we can often also assume that ground water and watershed divides coincide so that GW  is negligible.

{"paragraph": "1.8.2.1 Streamflow In  most  humid  regions,  at  least,  streamflow  is usually  by  far  the  major  component  of  runoff.  If  the region  of  interest  is  a  watershed,  streamflow  can  be measured at a single point—a gauging station at the watershed  outlet.  Continuous  monitoring  at  gauging stations is expensive because it requires elaborate on- site instrumentation and continued calibration (see ap- pendix  E),  but  it  can  usually  be  done  relatively  pre- cisely.  If  the  water  balance  is  to  be  computed  for  a region other than a watershed (e.g., country or conti- nent), spatial as well as temporal averages of measure- ments at several gauging stations must be computed. This presents a statistical challenge because of the typ- ically  uneven  distribution  of  gauging  stations,  the nested  nature  of  watersheds,  the  effects  of  scale,  and other complications that increase uncertainty. Despite the importance of streamflow data, main- tenance  of  a  comprehensive  global  river  monitoring network faces numerous technological, economic, and institutional  obstacles.

The  error  is  com- pounded when snow is involved (chapter 5). Compu- tation of areal average values requires consideration of  the  density  and  distribution  of  individual  gauges (most gauges are located at relatively low elevations in populated areas), the degree to which observations at nearby gauges are duplicative, and other factors. Milly and Dunne (2002) examined sources of er- ror in precipitation measurements as part of a global study of water balances in large watersheds (average area = 51,000 km2). They considered three additive sources of error: (1) poor distribution of gauges, (2) errors in measurements at individual gauges (section 4.2.1.2.7), and (3) failure to sample high elevations, where  precipitation  usually  increases  due  to graphic effects (section 4.1.5). In watersheds with  the highest  precipitation  errors,  the  main  error  source was failure to sample high elevations. Overall, how- ever,  the  three  error  sources  varied  in  importance.

{"paragraph": "1.8.2.4 Storage The net change in watershed storage over a pe- riod  of  observation  is  the  difference  between  the amount of water stored as ground water and in riv- ers,  lakes,  soil,  vegetation,  and  snow  and  ice  at  the end  of  the  measurement  period  and  the  amount stored at the beginning of the period. If S  represents the watershed storage at the end of year t and ΔS  ≡ S – S is the change in storage over year t, then the average change in storage over a T-yr period, μ =0 0 (1.19) Until  very  recently,  the  only  way  of  directly  ob- serving storage changes was to combine periodic rep- resentative  observations  of  all  storage  components distributed  over  the  region  of  interest.  Such  observa- tions—particularly  of  ground  water,  which  is  usually the largest storage reservoir—are virtually never avail- Hydrology: Basic Concepts and Challenges able. Lacking these, hydrologists attempt to minimize the value of μ by (1) using long measurement peri- ods  (large  T)  and  (2)  selecting  the  time  of  beginning and end of the measurement period such that storage values are likely to be nearly equal (small ΔS ). In the United States, the USGS attempts to minimize the val- ues of ΔS  − S , and hence S , by beginning the water year on 1 October, on the assumption that by this time transpiration will have largely ceased and soil moisture and ground-water storage will have been recharged to near their maximum levels. However, other water-year spans may be more appropriate for specific regions— for example, in northern areas the time of disappear- ance  of  the  annual snowpack  in  the  spring  may  be  a time when watershed storage is likely to be full. A new tool for directly observing regional storage changes  became  available  in  2002,  when  the  Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission was launched. The GRACE mission consists of two satellites at an altitude of ~450 km in an identi- cal  polar  orbit.  Mass  redistribution  on  earth  is  mea- sured by precisely monitoring the distance between the two  satellites  and  tracking  their  positions  via  global- positioning-system satellites (Tapley et al. 2004). The GRACE signal reflects changes in vertically integrated stored  water,  including  snowpacks,  glaciers,  surface water,  soil  moisture,  and  ground  water  at  all  depths. The  system  can  measure  mass  changes  equivalent  to ~1 cm of water at the land surface over a distance of a few  hundred  kilometers  or  more,  and  the  measure- ments  can  be  used  to  assess  total  water-storage changes in regions over many hundreds to thousands of  kilometers.  At  these  scales,  many  studies  have shown  that  GRACE-derived  stored-water  observa- tions compare well with ground-based measurements and  hydrological  models  (figure  1.14),  and  indicate that GRACE can be used to monitor hydrological sys- tems  and  improve  hydrological  modeling  (Lettenma- ier and Famiglietti 2006; Güntner 2008; Ramillien et al. 2008; Longuevergne et al. 2010). However,  if  the  spatial  scale  of  interest  is  less than a few hundred kilometers, or if the time period for averaging includes periods before 2002, GRACE data cannot be used.

Various  approaches  to  this  problem are  described  in  section  6.8.  However,  because  the direct computation of average regional evapotranspi- ration is so intractable, it is often estimated from the regional  water  balance  via  equation  (1.17),  usually with the additional assumption that GW  is negligi- ble, i.e., as μ  = μ  − μ Equation  (1.21)  is  probably  the  most  common application of hydrologic analysis. For example, in a global  analysis  of  the  effects  of  vegetation  density and  type  on  evapotranspiration,  Peel  et  al.

{"paragraph": "1.9.1 Spatial Variability Precipitation,  soil  moisture,  evapotranspiration, ground-water  levels,  and  the  properties  of  topogra- phy,  snowpack,  soil,  and  vegetation  that  influence hydrologic  processes  vary  spatially  over  the  geo- graphic  regions  that  constitute  control  volumes  for hydrologic analyses. Descriptions of spatial variabil- ity  are  based  on  measurements  made  at  discrete points  (e.g.,  precipitation  gauges).  These  measure- ments,  which  may  be  expressed  as  time  averages, constitute spatial samples. Traditional statistical methods, such as those de- scribed in appendix C, can be used to compute spatial averages and measures of spatial variability from the point values. However, spatially distributed quantities usually  have  two  characteristics  that  can  cause  con- ventional  statistical  measures  to  be  misleading:  (1) measurement points are unevenly distributed over the region  and  (2)  values  measured  at  “nearby”  points are  likely  to  be  similar  and,  to  some  extent,  redun- dant. The point values are therefore almost always an unrepresentative  sample  of  the  true  field,  and  com- monly large portions of the area have no information. Because of this, and because of the importance of accurately quantifying variables such as precipitation, special techniques have been developed for character- izing  and  accounting  for  spatial  variability.  The  es- sence of the most widely used of these techniques is to  examine  the  measured  point  values  to  identify  a mathematical  model  that  relates  the  average  differ- ence Δp(d) in values observed at two points a distance d apart.

The application of these techniques to other quantities can enhance the understanding of their spatial distribution and variability."}, {"question": "Why are satellite or radar observations increasingly used in conjunction with ground-level measurements for hydrologic analyses?", "answer": "Satellite or radar observations are increasingly used because they can provide additional information about areal distribution, enhancing the accuracy of hydrologic analyses.

These properties can alter the way water moves through and is stored within the environment, impacting the overall hydrologic cycle and the spatial variability of hydrologic quantities."}]}
{"paragraph": "1.9.2.1 Time Series As  noted,  the  inputs,  storages,  and  outputs  in figures 1.1, 1.2, and 1.8 are all time-distributed vari- ables. Thus, the concept of time variability is inher- ent to the concept of the hydrologic system, and we have seen how time  averaging  is applied  to develop alternative forms of the conservation equations. De- scriptions  and  comparisons  of  time-distributed  vari- ables in terms of their average value, variability, and other characteristics are made by applying the statis- tical methods described in appendix C to data sam- ples called time series: A time series is a time-ordered sequence of discrete values of a variable separated by a constant time interval Δt. Time series are conventionally treated as representa- tive samples of the long-term behavior of the variable (but see the discussion in section 1.9.2.3). For all time-series analyses, the time interval, Δt, must be selected and the total time period of interest divided into intervals of length Δt. Usually Δt = 1 yr for water-balance or flood analysis, but for other pur- poses  might  be  1  day  or  1  month.  Some  hydro- logic  time-series  variables  are  inherently  discrete— for example, the number of days with more than 25 mm rain in each year at a particular location. How- ever, variables like precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow are continuous time traces that take on values at every instant in time. For  statistical  analysis,  one  must  convert  a  con- tinuous trace into discrete form. To do this, first spec- ify the time interval, then, depending on the purpose of the analysis, select a single value of the variable of interest associated with each interval.

The choice of Δt should be guided by the specific research question or application, and hydrologists must be aware of the potential consequences of selecting an inappropriate time interval, which can lead to misleading or incomplete conclusions."}, {"question": "How do the statistical characteristics of time series developed from continuous time traces depend on the purpose of the analysis?", "answer": "The statistical characteristics of time series developed from continuous time traces depend on the purpose of the analysis because different purposes may require different discretization schemes and selected values.

Note that the average flow, 39.2 m3/s, is exceeded only 27.5% of the time.

Chapter 1 long-term trends or cycles, i.e., that hydrologic time series are stationary. Stationarity is the assumption that a time series is a representative sample of long-term (i.e., future) behavior. If stationarity can be assumed, most traditional statistical concepts can be applied to time series, in- cluding  the  idea  that  increasing  sample  size  (i.e., length of observation period) increases confidence in statistical  inferences.  Clearly,  this  idea  is  question- able if the underlying system is changing over time. As pointed out by Milly et al. (2008), the station- arity assumption has long been compromised by hu- man disturbances (e.g., water infrastructure, channel modifications, drainage works, land-cover and land- use changes) as well as natural climate changes and low-frequency  internal  variability  (the teleconnections discussed  in  section  2.1.6).  Traditionally,  water-re- source planners have considered natural change and variability to be sufficiently small to allow stationar- ity-based design, and have made adjustments for sig- nificant known human disturbances. However, substantial anthropogenic change of the earth’s climate is altering the means and extremes of precipitation,  evapotranspiration,  and  rates  of  dis- charge of rivers (see section 2.2.8), and the relation be- tween  precipitation  and  streamflow  (Zhang  et  al. 2011). Because of this, Milly et al.

This model has a simple physical interpretation, where 1/k represents a significant reservoir time constant. The simplicity and interpretability of this model make it a practical choice for understanding and analyzing hydrologic systems."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic control volumes, such as natural watersheds, what is the role of observations in determining the outflow function?", "answer": "In hydrologic control volumes like natural watersheds, observations of storage volume and changes in outflow rate over time (dø/dt) are used to deduce the form of the outflow function f(S). This approach is part of the conceptual model described in section 1.12, which aims to understand watershed functioning by analyzing the relationship between storage and outflow."}, {"question": "How does storage affect the relative variability of outflows compared to inflows in hydrologic reservoirs?", "answer": "Storage decreases the relative variability of outflows compared to inflows. This can be quantitatively characterized using standard statistical measures such as the coefficient of variation or simple ratios determined from flow duration curves (FDCs). The reduction in variability is a result of the storage effect, which dampens the fluctuations in inflows, leading to more stable outflows."}, {"question": "In what way does storage influence the persistence of outflows in hydrologic systems?", "answer": "Storage increases the persistence of outflows, meaning that high values are more likely to be followed by high values, and low values by low values. This persistence can be characterized by the coefficient of autocorrelation in time series analysis. The increased persistence is due to the buffering effect of storage, which smooths out the variability in inflows, resulting in more consistent outflow patterns over time."}, {"question": "Why do water-supply reservoirs decrease outflow variability, and what is the implication of this effect?", "answer": "Water-supply reservoirs are designed to decrease outflow variability by storing excess water during periods of high inflow and releasing it during periods of low inflow. This reduction in variability increases the reliability of the water supply, making it more consistent and predictable. The implication of this effect is that water-supply reservoirs can help mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods by regulating the flow of water, thereby providing a more stable water resource for various uses."}, {"question": "In the context of linear reservoirs, what is the physical interpretation of the constant k in the equation ø = k · S?", "answer": "In a linear reservoir, the constant k has a physical interpretation as the inverse of the reservoir time constant (1/k). This means that k represents how quickly the reservoir responds to changes in storage volume, with higher values of k indicating faster response times and lower values indicating slower response times. Understanding the value of k is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of hydrologic systems, especially in the context of water resource management."}, {"question": "How does the nature of the outflow function f(S) impact the analysis of hydrologic reservoirs?", "answer": "The nature of the outflow function f(S) significantly impacts the analysis of hydrologic reservoirs because it determines how the outflow rate responds to changes in storage volume. Different forms of f(S) can lead to varying degrees of nonlinearity in the system's response, affecting predictions of outflow patterns and the overall behavior of the reservoir. Therefore, accurately determining the form of f(S) is essential for reliable modeling and management of hydrologic reservoirs."}, {"question": "In hydrologic systems, what is the relationship between storage and the coefficient of variation of outflows?", "answer": "In hydrologic systems, storage is inversely related to the coefficient of variation of outflows. As storage increases, the coefficient of variation decreases, indicating a reduction in the relative variability of outflows. This relationship highlights the stabilizing effect of storage on outflow patterns, which is a critical aspect of hydrologic reservoir management and water resource planning."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the effects of storage on outflow time series important in hydrology?", "answer": "Understanding the effects of storage on outflow time series is important in hydrology because it allows for better prediction and management of water resources. By recognizing how storage influences the variability and persistence of outflows, hydrologists can more accurately forecast water availability, mitigate the impacts of extreme events, and optimize water storage and release strategies to meet various societal and environmental needs."}]}
{"paragraph": "1.10.3 Residence Time The residence time of a reservoir is the average length of time that a “parcel” of water spends in the reservoir. Residence time (also called transit time or turn- over time) is a universal relative measure of reservoir storage  (Bolin  and  Rodhe  1973).  For  a  reservoir  in steady state (which can usually be assumed for natu- ral hydrologic reservoirs), the average rates of inflow and outflow are equal, and Residence time, T , can be calculated by dividing the average reservoir storage, µ by the average rate of inflow, µ , or outflow, µ That is, For  many  hydrologic  reservoirs,  such  as  lakes, values of μ  and μ  or μ can be readily determined, and  computation  of  residence  time  is  straightfor- ward.  For  others,  such  as  watersheds  and  ground- water  bodies,  it  may  be  difficult  to  determine  the value of μ with precision; in these cases, we can usu- ally  speak  of  residence  times  in  relative  terms—for example, under similar climatic regimes, streams re- ceiving  water  from  ground-water  reservoirs  with large residence times (i.e., with large volumes of stor- age  per  unit  watershed  area)  will  tend  to  have  less variable  and  more  persistent  streamflow  than  those receiving  water  from  reservoirs  with  shorter  resi- dence times (table 1.4). For a linear reservoir, equation (1.24) applies to the average values, i.e., and we see from (1.25) that the reservoir constant k equals the inverse of the residence time: We  can  quantify  the  variability  and  persistence effects of storage (section 1.10.2) as functions of resi- dence time for a linear reservoir, as shown in figure 1.18.

Understanding this relationship is crucial for quantifying the variability and persistence effects of storage in linear reservoirs."}, {"question": "How do residence times in groundwater reservoirs affect streamflow variability and persistence?", "answer": "Residence times in groundwater reservoirs significantly impact streamflow variability and persistence. Streams receiving water from groundwater reservoirs with large residence times tend to have less variable and more persistent streamflow. This is because larger residence times indicate larger volumes of storage per unit watershed area, which helps to regulate streamflow. In contrast, streams receiving water from reservoirs with shorter residence times will have more variable streamflow."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic reservoirs, what challenges arise when determining residence time for certain types of reservoirs?", "answer": "Determining residence time can be challenging for certain types of reservoirs, such as watersheds and groundwater bodies. This is because it may be difficult to determine the value of average reservoir storage with precision. As a result, residence times for these reservoirs are often discussed in relative terms, comparing the characteristics of reservoirs under similar climatic regimes."}, {"question": "Why is it important to quantify the variability and persistence effects of storage as functions of residence time?", "answer": "Quantifying the variability and persistence effects of storage as functions of residence time is important because it allows hydrologists to understand how different reservoirs respond to changes in inflow and outflow rates. By analyzing these effects, hydrologists can better predict and manage streamflow, which is crucial for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems and ensuring sustainable water resources. Moreover, understanding these relationships can inform decisions related to water storage and management practices."}, {"question": "In the context of reservoir storage, how do small values of μ/μ affect the variability and persistence of streamflow?", "answer": "Even small values of μ/μ can have substantial effects on the variability and persistence of streamflow. This suggests that even minor changes in the ratio of reservoir storage to inflow or outflow rates can significantly impact the characteristics of streamflow. As a result, hydrologists must carefully consider these relationships when managing and predicting streamflow in various hydrologic reservoirs."}, {"question": "How does the concept of residence time apply to natural hydrologic reservoirs versus human-made reservoirs?", "answer": "The concept of residence time applies to both natural hydrologic reservoirs, such as lakes and watersheds, and human-made reservoirs. However, the calculation of residence time may be more straightforward for natural reservoirs, which are often assumed to be in a steady state. In contrast, human-made reservoirs may have more complex inflow and outflow regimes, requiring more sophisticated methods to determine residence time."}, {"question": "Why is it useful to discuss residence times in relative terms for certain types of reservoirs?", "answer": "Discussing residence times in relative terms is useful for reservoirs where determining the exact value of average reservoir storage is challenging. By comparing the characteristics of reservoirs under similar climatic regimes, hydrologists can still gain insights into the relative effects of residence time on streamflow variability and persistence. This approach allows for more informed decision-making and management of water resources, even when precise calculations are not possible."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic reservoirs, what are the implications of residence time for water resource management?", "answer": "The implications of residence time for water resource management are significant. Understanding residence time and its effects on streamflow variability and persistence can inform decisions related to water storage, release, and management practices. By considering residence time, hydrologists and water managers can better predict and manage streamflow, ensuring sustainable water resources and maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems. This knowledge can also guide the design and operation of human-made reservoirs, optimizing their performance and minimizing environmental impacts."}]}

Such a situation is rarely possible in hydrology, particularly for field measure- ments, where we typically have a single measurement of a given quantity at a given place and time. However, the theory can be applied to a single measurement, pro- vided we have information about the uncertainty of such measurements generally. Ideally, such information should be based on systematic studies of measurement precision. In many cases, especially for field observations involving several steps, such studies have been used to develop “generally accepted” values for a given mea- surement type. For example, for individual stream-dis- charge (volume rate of streamflow) measurements, the USGS (Sauer and Meyer 1992) uses p = 0.68 and rates the precision of its measurements as ε% (p = 0.68) “Excellent” 2 “Good” 5 “Fair” 8 “Poor” > 8 Thus for a “good” discharge measurement, where dis- = 32.5 m3/s, δx = ε · x charge x  = 0.05 · 32.5 = 1.6 meas meas m3/s, and one would state “I am 68% sure that discharge is between 30.9 m3/s and 34.1 m3/s.” When needed for the error-propagation computa- tions described in section 1.11.2.4, the error standard deviation can then be calculated from equation (1.36) as 1B1.2 Repeated Measurements In some situations, as in laboratory experiments, one may actually make repeated measurements of a particu- lar quantity. In this case, the best estimate of the true value is again the mean µ  as in equation (1.33). How- ever, the error standard deviation of this quantity is given by the standard error of the mean, σ , which is calculated from statistical theory (section C.11.2.1) as Thus we would now state the confidence in our result as x µx x x µx 1B1.3 Time-Series Values at a Single Location 1B1.3.1 General Case Hydrologists often use average annual values of pre- cipitation and other quantities to characterize the hydrologic climate at a particular location. The average annual value is calculated as the mean µ  of the time series of annual values x  for the T years of record: If the measured values are independent—i.e., if there is no reason to suspect that there is a systematic relation between successive values of x , such as a trend or cycle—we can again use the standard error of the mean to characterize the error standard deviation [equation (1B1.1)]: . (1B1.4) If a significant time trend is identified (see box C.9 on the disk), the effective sample size T  for calculating the standard error is smaller than T; so the uncertainty is larger than given by (1B1.4). The value of T  can be cal- culated using the methods described in section C.11.4. 1B1.3.2 Average Annual Streamflow The USGS measures and reports average streamflow for each year at some 25,000 stream gauges. It reports the uncertainty of annual average streamflow using a scheme similar to that described above for individual streamflow measurements (Risley and Gannett 2006). However, for average annual streamflow the confidence level p = 0.95 and relative errors are reported as ε% (p = 0.95) “Excellent” 5 “Good” 10 “Fair” 15 “Poor” > 15 Thus, if the average annual streamflow for a given = 17.2 m3/s at a gauge rated “good,” the uncer- year is µ = 0.10 · 17.2 = 1.7 m3/s, and one tainty is  δµ  = ε · µ would state “I am 95% sure that the annual discharge is between 15.5 m3/s and 18.9 m3/s.” The error standard deviation for average annual streamflow is then given by equation (1.36): /s (rounded). Chapter 1 1B1.3.3 Long-Term Average Streamflow The T-yr average streamflow at a given gauge, µ , is calculated as , (1B1.5) where µ  are the average annual streamflows for years t , is found as described in section 1B1.3.2; i.e., Assuming stationarity, the error standard deviation of the T-yr average streamflow is found from (1.38), (1B1.5), and (1B1.6) as Ê Q1ˆ Ê ˆ T 1 . 96 T 1 . 9 6 T 1. 96 Ë ¯ 1B1.4 Values Measured Over an Area Quantities such as precipitation, snow depth, soil moisture, or vegetation properties are distributed over areas, such as a drainage basin. Areal averages of such quantities are typically calculated from time series of measurements at several points within the area. Compu- tations of the areal average and its uncertainty are com- plicated by the distribution of sampling points, the correlation between measurements at different points, and any spatial and temporal trends. There is no simple general approach to such computations, even in the absence of systematic errors (which can be large). One reasonably straightforward approach to assess- ing random uncertainty that is applicable in areas within which there are no regional trends has been developed in the context of precipitation by Rodriguez-Iturbe and Mejia (1974). In this approach, annual precipitation is determined at N gauges for each of T years. The average is calculated at each gauge, and the average of the aver- ages is taken as the areal average µ . The areal standard deviation σ  is similarly calculated over all the gauges. The overall error standard deviation σ  is then found by multiplying σ  by (1) a factor F (T) that depends on the number of years of record and the strength of any time trends and (2) a factor F (N) that depends on the num- ber of gauges and the pattern of spatial correlation of the gauges: Hydrology: Basic Concepts and Challenges x 1 2 Ax approach are given in section 4.3.5. 1B1.5 Quantities Determined by Counting Hydrologists are often concerned with the average number of events, such as floods, droughts, or days with rainfall, that occur in a given time period (such as a year). Such values are determined by examining streamflow or weather records, and counting the number of event occurrences, n , in the T time periods of record. The aver- age µ  is found as I n   t h i s   c a s e   t h e r e   i s   n o  m e a s u r e m e n t   e rr o r ,   b u t  t h e r e i s  u n c e r t a i n t y  a s   t o  h o w   w e l l  t h e   a v e r a g e  c a l c u l a t e d  f o r t h e   p e r i o d   o f  r e c o r d   r e p r e s e n t s  t h e   t r u e   a v e r a g e .   F r o m the statistical theory, this uncertainty is given by the error standard deviation σ  where = µ (1B1.10) 1B1.6 Example A study of precipitation measured at 29 gauges over a period of 30 yr in a region of eastern Nebraska and northern Kansas gave the average precipitation µ  = 619 mm/yr, with a measurement uncertainty σ  = 23.4 mm/ yr. Measurements on the Big Nemaha River at Falls City, Nebraska, which drains the region, give average stream- flow for the same period µ  = 157 mm/yr, and are rated “good.” Assuming no ground-water inflows or outflows, we want to calculate (a) the average annual evapotrans- fidence limits for µ . a. Using equation (1.21), µ  = 619 – 157 = 462 mm/yr. b. Referring  to  section  1B1.3.3,  the  “good”  rating  for streamflow measurements corresponds to ε = 0.1, so = 0.1 · µ /1.96.

{"paragraph": "1.12 Application of Basic Concepts to Modeling Watershed Functioning To  demonstrate  the  significance  and  power  of the  basic  concepts  introduced  in  this  chapter,  we conclude  by  describing  the  conceptually  simple  but useful predictive model of watershed functioning de- veloped by Kirchner (2009). This model was applied to  two  research  watersheds  in  Wales  (figure  1.22) where  streamflow  was  continuously  monitored  and there were well-distributed observations of precipita- tion and of meteorological data that allow computa- tion  of  evapotranspiration.  Kirchner’s  approach  is particularly valuable for examination here because it makes straightforward use of basic systems concepts and simple storage relations (section 1.10) to develop a predictive watershed model (appendix F). Obviously in this case virtually all the uncertainty in the evapotranspiration estimate is due to the uncer- tainty in the precipitation value—a common occurrence in water-balance computations. In  these  watersheds,  ground-water  inflows  and outflows appear to be negligible, and equations (1.14) and (1.15) can be combined as = - - q, where  S  is  watershed  storage  volume, t  is  time,  p  is instantaneous  watershed  precipitation  rate,  et  is instantaneous  watershed  evapotranspiration  rate, and q is instantaneous streamflow rate at the water- shed outlet. As discussed in section 1.8.2.4, it is not usually possible  to  measure  watershed  storage.  However,  if at  least  most  of  the  precipitation  infiltrates  into  the unsaturated  zone  and  then  into  the  ground-water reservoir  (which  appears  true  for  these  watersheds) before  entering  the  stream  network,  the  physics  of subsurface  flow  justifies  the  assumption  that  the streamflow rate is a single-valued function of storage only, i.e., that dq/dS > 0 for all q and S. As noted by Kirchner (2009), watersheds are large and complex, so we cannot use fundamental physics to determine the form of this function a priori. Instead, we make use of equation (1.23) and write it as q = f (S), Figure 1.21 Geometric represen- tation of error magnitude of evapo- transpiration estimate calculated via equation (1.21), σ , relative to mea- surement errors in precipitation, σ , and streamflow, σ , as given by equation (1.40).

If the assumptions about f  are true, we can invert (1.42) Thus, the measured discharge provides an implicit mea- sure of the volume of water stored in the watershed. To  derive  information  about  the  nature  of  the storage-discharge relation, we can use the chain rule for derivatives and (1.41) to relate the rate of change of streamflow to the rate of change of storage: dq dq dS dq = = ( - - q). dt dS dt dS The term dq/dS represents the sensitivity of dis- charge to changes in storage, which normally would be expressed in terms of S. However, because of our assumptions about f  dq/dS can also be expressed as a function f  of q: Combining (1.44) and (1.45) we see that dq dq dt dq dt dS dS dt Hydrology: Basic Concepts and Challenges which  implies  that  dq/dS  can  be  determined  from instantaneous measurements of precipitation, evapo- transpiration,  discharge,  and  the  rate  of  change  of discharge. And, because discharge can be measured more  reliably  than  precipitation  or  evapotranspira- tion  at  the  watershed  scale,    can  be  most  accu- rately  evaluated  at  times  when  precipitation  and evapotranspiration fluxes are small compared to dis- charge. Under these conditions, dq dq dt (q) = ª - . Because  evapotranspiration  is  negligible  at  night, Kirchner  (2009)  used  (1.47)  to  determine f   from  si- multaneous values of q and dq/dt for rainless nighttime periods. There are several detailed steps to this determi- nation,  but  Kirchner  concluded  that  the  relationship was well approximated by a simple power law: as shown in figure 1.23.

More important for hydrologic predictions, one can use (1.46) along with (1.47) to write an equation giving streamflow as a function of precipitation and evapotranspiration: Kirchner (2009) discusses mathematical aspects of using (1.51a) for practical streamflow predictions.

This is a common occurrence in water-balance computations, highlighting the importance of accurate precipitation measurements for reliable evapotranspiration estimates."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed storage, why is it challenging to measure watershed storage directly?", "answer": "Measuring watershed storage directly is challenging because it is not usually possible to measure watershed storage. However, if most of the precipitation infiltrates into the unsaturated zone and then into the groundwater reservoir before entering the stream network, the physics of subsurface flow justifies the assumption that the streamflow rate is a single-valued function of storage only. This assumption allows for indirect estimation of watershed storage through streamflow measurements."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between discharge and storage in a watershed, and how is it determined?", "answer": "The relationship between discharge and storage in a watershed is represented by the equation q = f(S), where q is the discharge and S is the storage. This relationship is determined by using the chain rule for derivatives and relating the rate of change of streamflow to the rate of change of storage. The sensitivity of discharge to changes in storage, dq/dS, can be expressed as a function of q, allowing for the determination of the storage-discharge relation from instantaneous measurements of precipitation, evapotranspiration, discharge, and the rate of change of discharge."}, {"question": "How does Kirchner's model account for the complexity of watershed systems?", "answer": "Kirchner's model accounts for the complexity of watershed systems by recognizing that watersheds are large and complex, making it impossible to determine the form of the storage-discharge function a priori using fundamental physics. Instead, the model uses empirical relationships, such as the power law relationship between discharge and storage, to capture the behavior of the watershed system. This approach allows for a simplified representation of the complex processes involved in watershed functioning."}, {"question": "In the context of streamflow predictions, what are the implications of using Kirchner's model?", "answer": "Using Kirchner's model for streamflow predictions has significant implications because it allows for accurate predictions of future streamflow values based on successive values of precipitation and evapotranspiration. The model's ability to capture the storage-discharge relationship and account for the complexity of watershed systems makes it a valuable tool for hydrologic predictions. However, the model's validity is dependent on the precision of discharge measurements and could be altered by changes in climate and/or land use, highlighting the need for careful consideration of these factors in streamflow prediction applications."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the sensitivity of discharge to changes in storage in watershed modeling?", "answer": "Considering the sensitivity of discharge to changes in storage is important in watershed modeling because it allows for the determination of the storage-discharge relation and the prediction of streamflow. The sensitivity of discharge to changes in storage, dq/dS, is a critical parameter in understanding how watersheds respond to changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. By accounting for this sensitivity, models like Kirchner's can provide more accurate predictions of streamflow and improve our understanding of watershed behavior."}, {"question": "How does the assumption of a single-valued function of storage only for streamflow rate impact the modeling of watershed systems?", "answer": "The assumption of a single-valued function of storage only for streamflow rate simplifies the modeling of watershed systems by allowing for the indirect estimation of watershed storage through streamflow measurements. This assumption is justified by the physics of subsurface flow and enables the use of empirical relationships, such as the power law relationship between discharge and storage, to capture the behavior of the watershed system. However, this assumption may not always hold, and its validity should be carefully evaluated in different watershed contexts."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic predictions, what are the challenges associated with using Kirchner's model?", "answer": "The challenges associated with using Kirchner's model for hydrologic predictions include the need for accurate discharge measurements, the potential impact of changes in climate and/or land use on the model's validity, and the assumption of a single-valued function of storage only for streamflow rate. Additionally, the model's simplicity may not capture all the complexities of watershed systems, and its application may require careful consideration of these limitations.

{"paragraph": "1.13 The Future of Hydrology Subsequent  chapters  of  this  text  focus  on  the physics  of  individual  hydrologic  processes.  These principles  are  essential  components  of  hydrologic science.  However,  as  we  have  seen  in  this  chapter, there  are  intrinsic  challenges  to  hydrology  that  im- pede the extrapolation of the basic physics processes operating instantaneously at a “point” (i.e., a small, relatively homogeneous region of the earth’s surface) to an understanding of the hydrology of a finite area over a finite time. In addition to these intrinsic problems, it has be- come  apparent  in  recent  decades  that  there  are  new extrinsic challenges facing the science and practice of hydrology. Human population and development have been increasing dramatically for the last 150 years, to the point where human impact on the earth’s surface now rivals natural geologic and biologic forces (Sand- erson et al. 2002), and the anthropogenic effect on cli- mate  is  all  but  certain  (Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change 2007; Gillett et al. 2012).

Wagener  et  al.  (2010,  p.  1)  argue  that  these nearly  ubiquitous  and  increasing  anthropogenic modifications of the hydrologic cycle require a “par- adigm shift” in hydrology to focus on “predictions of system behavior that are beyond the range of previ- ously observed variability or that result from signifi- cant alterations of physical . . . system characteristics to become the new norm.” Hydrologists must be able not  only  to  understand  how  individual  hydrologic processes  function,  but  also  to  synthesize  and  inte- grate  the  behavior  of  hydrologic  systems,  including the  effects  of  changing  (i.e.,  nonstationary)  climate, soils, topography, vegetation, and land use. The key elements  of  the  changes  in  the  science  and  practice of hydrology envisioned by Wagener et al. (2010) are summarized in table 1.6 on the following page. Thus, although the basic physical principles de- scribed in this text are powerful tools, the degree of knowledge  that  can  be  obtained  with  them  is bounded.  Hydrologists  must  be  as  aware  of  these limitations as they are of the tools themselves. Thus, we  have  tried  to  point  out  the  assumptions  behind each conceptual approach and the difficulties in ap- plying it, because It ain’t so much the things we don’t know that gets us in trouble. It’s the things we know that ain’t so.8 Part I: Introduction Table 1.6 Key Elements of a Paradigm Shift in Hydrologic Science. Humans are external to the hydrologic system.

Humans are intrinsic to the hydrologic system, both as agents of change and as beneficiaries of ecosystem services. Nonstationary world: past is no longer a sufficient guide to the future, expected variability could be outside the range of observed variability. Both system and response evolve: no longer a boundary value problem, boundary conditions and interfaces themselves evolve and are coupled. Becomes a complex adaptive system. Comparative hydrology: learning from individual places embedded along gradients (e.g., changing climate, human imprint) and across spatial scales. Hydrologists as both analysts and synthesists (akin to the macroscope) studying the coupled system across a range of time and space scales. Observations to track the evolution of both structure and response in coupled systems and subsystems. Observe and analyze real places where humans live and interact with the hydrologic system at range of scales. Model predictions derive credibility via more in-depth diag- nostic evaluation of model consistency with underlying sys- tem and testing of behavior outside of observed range. Real-time learning: observations (sensing, including partici- patory human sensing), modeling and management are interactive exercises with feedbacks and updating.

Write out the detailed steps leading from equation (1.44) to equation (1.51b). The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are interval, rather than ratio, scales and hence require designation of an arbitrary zero point as well as a unit of measurement. 2 This latter formula can be readily remembered by recalling Einstein’s famous formula E = mc2, where E is the amount of energy in a quantity of mass, m, and c is the velocity of light. The arguments of exponential and trigonometric functions should be dimensionless, though one some- times encounters empirical relations in which this rule is violated. This is stated colloquially as “Baldy’s Law”: “Some of it plus the rest of it equals all of it.” We do not know who Baldy is or was. Note that hydrologists also use the term “runoff ” to denote overland flow, which is discussed in chapter 10. Note that there are many hydrologic reservoirs for which this relation does not hold, e.g., a melting snow- pack, the global atmosphere, the global ocean. δx is always stated as a positive value and the error range is assumed symmetrical, except that the lower bound cannot be < 0 for quantities that are always positive.

The following terms are used to describe the interactions of matter and radiant energy at a given wavelength: Absorptivity,  ,  is  the  fraction  of  the  incident  en- ergy at wavelength λ that is absorbed by a surface; this energy raises the temperature of the matter and/ or causes a phase change (melting or evaporation). Reflectivity,  ,  is  the  fraction  of  the  incident  en- ergy at wavelength λ that is reflected by the surface; this  energy  does  not  affect  the  matter  and  contin- ues traveling undiminished in a new direction. Transmissivity,  ,  is  the  fraction  of  the  incident energy at wavelength λ that is transmitted through the  matter;  this  energy  does  not  affect  the  matter and continues traveling undiminished in the origi- nal direction. The values of α , ρ , and τ must each be between 0 and 1, and, for a given surface and wavelength, must always sum to 1: α  + ρ  + τ The values of α , ρ , and τ vary with the type of the matter and the wavelength.

The consequences of these variations are significant, as they affect the amount of energy absorbed, reflected, or transmitted by the surface, which in turn influences the Earth's energy balance and the hydrologic cycle.

This gaseous envelope is characterized  by  the  typical  vertical  distributions  of pressure  and  temperature  shown  in  figure  2.2.  The pattern  of  vertical  temperature  gradients  delineates three  distinct  layers—the  troposphere,  stratosphere, and mesosphere—between which there is little mix- ing. Vertical temperature and pressure gradients vary with latitude, season, and local weather patterns: the boundary  between  the  troposphere  and  the  strato- sphere is higher (15 to 16 km) near the equator and lower (5–6 km) over the poles, and is higher in sum- mer  than  in  winter  at  a  given  location.

Above this,  the  ground-induced  turbulence  gradually  de- creases and the wind dynamics are increasingly con- trolled solely by horizontal pressure gradients and, at moderate  to  high  latitudes,  the  Coriolis  force.  The entire  layer  in  which  winds  are  affected  by  the  fric- tional resistance of the surface is called the planetary boundary layer. The thickness of this layer varies in space and time from a few tens of meters to one or two  kilometers  depending  on  the  topography  and roughness of the surface, the wind velocity, and the rate of heating or cooling of the surface (Peixoto and Oort 1992; Seidel et al. 2012). The  vertical  temperature  gradient  in  the  tropo- sphere is called the lapse rate; its average value is – 6.5°C/km. However, the local near-surface gradient is highly variable and may even temporarily reverse direction;  this  phenomenon  is  called  an  inversion. The  local  lapse  rate  has  a  strong  influence  on  the buoyancy  of  vertically  moving  “parcels”  of  air  and hence  on  the  vertical  transport  of  water  vapor  and heat.

As winds move over the surface, they encounter friction, which slows them down and creates turbulent eddies that mix the air, leading to the transfer of heat and moisture. The intensity of surface friction and the resulting turbulence vary depending on the surface roughness, wind velocity, and other factors, influencing the thickness of the planetary boundary layer and the overall dynamics of the atmosphere. Understanding the role of surface friction in atmospheric turbulence is crucial for modeling and predicting hydrologic processes, such as evaporation and precipitation, which are sensitive to the exchange of energy and moisture between the surface and the atmosphere."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of inversion important in understanding atmospheric temperature gradients?", "answer": "The concept of inversion is important because it refers to the temporary reversal of the local temperature gradient, which can significantly impact the vertical transport of water vapor and heat.

Some of the  gases  in  the  earth’s  atmosphere  are  strong  ab- sorbers  of  energy  in  particular  portions  of  the  solar spectrum. In particular, oxygen (O ) and ozone (O ) in the lower stratosphere shield terrestrial biota from much of the energy in the ultraviolet range, which is damaging to most forms of life.

The absorption of ultraviolet radiation by these gases helps maintain a habitable environment, which is essential for supporting hydrological processes and ecosystems."}, {"question": "How does the Earth's surface albedo influence the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back to outer space, and what are the implications for the Earth's energy balance?", "answer": "The Earth's surface albedo, which is the fraction of incident solar radiation that is reflected by a surface, influences the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back to outer space. A higher albedo means more radiation is reflected, while a lower albedo means more radiation is absorbed. The average albedo of the surface is around 0.3, which means that about 30% of the incident solar radiation is reflected back to outer space. This reflection has significant implications for the Earth's energy balance, as it affects the amount of energy available to heat the land and water, potentially influencing climate patterns, weather events, and hydrological processes."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the balance between incoming solar radiation, atmospheric absorption and reflection, and surface reflection in understanding the Earth's energy budget?", "answer": "Considering the balance between incoming solar radiation, atmospheric absorption and reflection, and surface reflection is crucial for understanding the Earth's energy budget because it helps to quantify the amount of energy available to heat the land and water, drive hydrological processes, and influence climate patterns. The balance between these components determines the amount of energy that is absorbed, reflected, or emitted, which in turn affects the Earth's temperature, weather patterns, and hydrological cycles. Understanding this balance is essential for predicting and managing water resources, as changes in the energy budget can have significant implications for precipitation, evaporation, and runoff patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of the Earth's energy budget, what is the significance of the 161 W/m^2 of insolation that is absorbed to heat the land and water at the Earth's surface?", "answer": "The 161 W/m^2 of insolation that is absorbed to heat the land and water at the Earth's surface is significant because it represents the energy that is available to drive hydrological processes, such as evaporation, melting, and precipitation. This energy is balanced by the net upward transport of latent and sensible heat and terrestrial radiation, which helps to maintain the Earth's energy balance. The absorption of this energy is crucial for supporting life on Earth, as it influences the formation of clouds, precipitation patterns, and the overall climate."}, {"question": "How do atmospheric gases like water vapor influence the absorption of solar radiation, and what are the implications for the Earth's energy budget?", "answer": "Atmospheric gases like water vapor absorb a significant portion of the sun's energy in the near-infrared range, which affects the amount of energy that is available to heat the land and water. This absorption has implications for the Earth's energy budget, as it influences the amount of energy that is absorbed, reflected, or emitted. The absorption of solar radiation by water vapor and other gases helps to maintain the Earth's energy balance, which is essential for supporting hydrological processes and ecosystems."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.1.3.2 Terrestrial (Longwave) Radiation and the Greenhouse Effect The  solar  radiation  absorbed  at  the  surface warms the land and oceans and provides latent heat for evaporation and melting. Some of this energy, a net  of  28  units,  is  transferred  to  the  atmosphere  by the turbulent-transfer processes described in chapter 3: 80 W/m2 associated with evaporation (latent heat) and 17 W/m2 as direct heating (sensible heat). The net energy exchanges at the surface result in an average earth-surface temperature of about 289 K (16°C).  Following  the  Stefan–Boltzmann  law  [equa- tion (2.1)], this temperature produces an upward ter- restrial radiation flux of about 396 W/m2. Following the Wien law [equation (2.3)], this energy is in the in- frared range, with wavelengths between 4 and 60 μm and a peak near 10 μm [curve (c) of figure 2.4]. Ter- restrial radiation is also called longwave radiation or thermal radiation. Naturally occurring and human-introduced gases and  clouds  strongly  absorb  specific  wavelengths  of the longwave radiation emitted by the surface (upper portion  of  figure  2.4).  Of  the  396  of  this  en- ergy emitted by the surface, 40 W/m2 are transmitted through  the  atmosphere  directly  to  outer  space  and 356 W/m2 are absorbed in the atmosphere by clouds and gases. The longwave radiation resulting from this heating  produces  a  199  of  upward  flux  to Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone outer  space  and  333  of  downward  flux  to warm the surface. The  absorption  and  downward  re-radiation  of longwave  radiation  in  the  atmosphere  is  called  the effect,  which  controls  the  temperature greenhouse of the earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect raises the average surface temperature about 34°C from its value in the absence of terrestrial radiation-absorbing components, –18°C, to its current value of 16°C.

Note that Part I: Introduction Although only 25% of the greenhouse effect is directly due to GHGs, the warming induced by increasing GHGs allows the air to hold more water vapor and clouds, creating a positive feedback that produces the remaining 75% of the effect (Lacis et al. 2010).

Anthropogenic  emissions  are  rapidly  increasing the concentrations of GHGs (figure 2.5). It is virtu- ally certain that most if not all of these increases are caused by human activities—particularly the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of forests—and these activities show every sign of continuing, and perhaps accelerating, for at least the next several decades. CO  concentration is currently about 400 ppm— about 60% larger than the preindustrial value of 250 ppm—and  is  projected  to  reach  500  ppm  or  higher by 2050, higher than the earth has experienced in the last million or so years. The concentrations of meth- ane  and  chlorofluorocarbons  are  increasing  at  even faster relative rates than is CO and are many times more effective (per molecule) than CO  at absorbing longwave radiation. Thus,  it  is  virtually  certain  that  the  increase  in global surface temperatures since about 1850 (figure 2.6)  has been caused by human-generated increases in  GHG  concentrations  (Karl  and  Trenberth  2003; Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  2007; Hansen et al. 2008; Lean and Rind 2008; Chapman and Davis 2010; Hansen et al. 2010).

This temperature is a balance between the energy input from the sun and the energy lost to the atmosphere, and it is influenced by the greenhouse effect, which traps some of the outgoing longwave radiation and warms the surface."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Stefan-Boltzmann law in understanding terrestrial radiation, and how does it relate to the Earth's surface temperature?", "answer": "The Stefan-Boltzmann law is significant in understanding terrestrial radiation because it describes the relationship between the temperature of an object and the amount of radiation it emits. According to this law, the Earth's surface temperature of about 289 K (16°C) produces an upward terrestrial radiation flux of about 396 W/m2, which is in the infrared range. This law helps to explain how the Earth's surface temperature is related to the amount of radiation it emits, and it is an important component of the Earth's energy balance."}, {"question": "How do human activities contribute to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and what are the implications of this increase for the Earth's climate?", "answer": "Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of forests, are rapidly increasing the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. The increase in GHG concentrations has significant implications for the Earth's climate, as it leads to an increase in the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes an increase in the Earth's surface temperature. The current concentration of CO2 is about 400 ppm, which is about 60% larger than the preindustrial value of 250 ppm, and it is projected to reach 500 ppm or higher by 2050. This increase in GHG concentrations is virtually certain to cause an increase in global surface temperatures, with potentially severe consequences for the environment and human societies."}, {"question": "In the context of the greenhouse effect, why is water vapor considered a critical component, despite only 25% of the effect being directly due to greenhouse gases?", "answer": "Water vapor is considered a critical component of the greenhouse effect because, although only 25% of the effect is directly due to greenhouse gases, the warming induced by increasing GHGs allows the air to hold more water vapor and clouds, creating a positive feedback that produces the remaining 75% of the effect. This means that water vapor plays a crucial role in amplifying the greenhouse effect, and its concentration is closely tied to the concentration of other greenhouse gases. As the concentration of GHGs increases, the air's capacity to hold water vapor also increases, leading to a stronger greenhouse effect and more pronounced warming of the Earth's surface."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the concentration of greenhouse gases and the Earth's surface temperature, and how do human activities influence this relationship?", "answer": "The concentration of greenhouse gases is directly related to the Earth's surface temperature, as an increase in GHG concentrations leads to an increase in the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes an increase in the Earth's surface temperature.

{"paragraph": "2.1.4 Latitudinal Energy Transfer As we have just seen, the major determinant of global  climate  is  the  overall  energy  budget  of  the earth, especially the balance between insolation and terrestrial radiation, which establishes the global av- erage surface temperature. The first-order spatial and temporal  variabilities  of  climate  are  determined  by the spherical shape of the earth (figure 2.7 on p. 56), its elliptical orbit around the sun, and the 23.5° tilt of its axis of rotation (figure 2.8 on p.  57),  which  pro- duce the seasonal and latitudinal variations in insola- tion shown in figure 2.9 (on p. 56). As a result of these planetary characteristics, the net radiation balance (i.e., the difference between so- lar  radiation  received  and  the  terrestrial  radiation emitted)  is  positive  for  latitudes  below  about  35°, and negative poleward of that. Because average total energy inputs and outputs must be in balance at all latitudes,  there  is  a  net  poleward  transfer  of  energy from  the  regions  of  surplus  to  those  of  deficit;  the magnitude  of  this  transfer  is  indicated  by  the  RT curve in figure 2.10(a) on p. 58.

The regions below about 35° latitude have a positive net radiation balance, meaning they receive more solar radiation than they emit as terrestrial radiation, while regions poleward of 35° have a negative net radiation balance. This imbalance necessitates a transfer of energy from the surplus regions to the deficit regions to maintain global energy balance."}, {"question": "In the context of energy transfer, what role does the general circulation of the atmosphere play?", "answer": "The general circulation of the atmosphere plays a significant role in the transfer of energy, with most of the transfer occurring via this mechanism.

This variability is a key driver of the hydrological cycle, impacting water availability and distribution across different regions and seasons."}, {"question": "Why is the balance between solar radiation received and terrestrial radiation emitted critical for climate and hydrology?", "answer": "The balance between solar radiation received and terrestrial radiation emitted is critical because it determines the net radiation balance, which in turn influences the Earth's surface temperature and climate patterns.

Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone circulating in large-scale horizontal eddies—both the quasi-stationary zones of high and low pressure dis- cussed  below  and  the  moving  cyclonic  storms  that dominate  weather  systems  in  the  midlatitudes—are the  major  agents  of  transport  above  latitude  30° (Barry and Chorley 1982). Figure 2.11 shows that the general circulation re- sults in regions of rising air near the equator and near latitude 60°, and descending air near latitude 30° and the  poles.  The  zones  of  ascent  are  characterized  by relatively  low  atmospheric  pressures  at  the  surface, and those of descent by high pressures. However, be- cause  of  the  distribution  of  continents  and  oceans, the zones of high and low pressure actually occur as cells rather than continuous belts (figure 2.12 on the following page). Horizontal pressure gradients are the basic driv- ing force for winds; these pressure forces along with forces  induced  by  the  motion  itself  (centrifugal forces, the Coriolis effect due to the earth’s rotation, and  friction)  produce  surface  winds  that  move  ap- proximately parallel to isobars, but with a tendency to  spiral  inward  toward  low-pressure  centers  and outward from high-pressure centers.

Circulations in the Southern Hemisphere are reversed (i.e., circulation around cyclones is clockwise). clockwise around lows (cyclonic circulation) (figure 2.13); the circulations are in the opposite sense in the Southern Hemisphere. The subtropical high-pressure zone exists as cells over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; these cells are especially well defined in the summer, and occur far- ther  to  the  north  in  the  summer  than in  the  winter. Since winds circulate clockwise around these highs, the  coastal  areas  of  southwestern  North  America and Europe are subject to dry, cool northerly winds in the summer. Conversely, the southeastern United States,  Hawaii,  the  Philippines,  and  Southeast  Asia are  subject  to  warm,  moist  winds  from  the  tropics and have warm, humid summers with frequent rain. The subpolar low-pressure zone occurs as cells over the  northern  Pacific  and  Atlantic,  which  are  espe- cially evident in winter. These cells, called the Aleu- tian Low (Pacific) and Icelandic Low (Atlantic), are “centers  of  action,”  where  major  midlatitude  cy- clonic storms develop their greatest intensities. Figure  2.14  on  p.  61  shows  the  global  distribu- tion of mean temperature in January and July. This distribution is clearly strongly related to the average receipt of solar radiation and hence to latitude, but it is modified by the distribution of the continents and oceans.  Because  of  water’s  very  high  heat  capacity, the annual temperature range of the oceans is much less  than  that  of  the  continents.  This  is  reflected  in the equatorward dip of the isotherms over the ocean in summer (oceans cooler than land), and the pole- ward dip in winter (oceans warmer than land). The very cold winter temperatures in the centers of  the  North  American  and  Asiatic  landmasses  are due to radiational cooling and distance from the rel- atively  warm  oceans;  these  low  temperatures  pro- duce  cells  of  high  density  and  high  pressure.  The situation is reversed in summer, when extensive solar radiational  heating  occurs,  and  these continents are then sites of generally low pressure. Note particularly the summertime trough of low pressure over south- ern Asia; winds associated with this trough carry the monsoon rains on which the agricultural economy of this vast and populous region depends.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of atmospheric circulation, what drives the general circulation of the atmosphere?", "answer": "The unequal latitudinal distribution of radiation and the requirement for the conservation of angular momentum on the rotating Earth drive the general circulation of the atmosphere, resulting in a system of three circulation cells."}, {"question": "How do the zones of ascent and descent in the general circulation of the atmosphere influence atmospheric pressure?", "answer": "The zones of ascent are characterized by relatively low atmospheric pressures at the surface, while those of descent are characterized by high pressures. This is because the distribution of continents and oceans causes the zones of high and low pressure to occur as cells rather than continuous belts. As a result, horizontal pressure gradients become the basic driving force for winds, which move approximately parallel to isobars but with a tendency to spiral inward toward low-pressure centers and outward from high-pressure centers."}, {"question": "Why do the subtropical high-pressure zones exist as cells over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and what are the implications for coastal areas?", "answer": "The subtropical high-pressure zones exist as cells over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans due to the general circulation of the atmosphere. These cells are especially well-defined in the summer and occur farther to the north in the summer than in the winter. As a result, coastal areas of southwestern North America and Europe are subject to dry, cool northerly winds in the summer, while the southeastern United States, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia are subject to warm, moist winds from the tropics, leading to warm, humid summers with frequent rain. This has significant implications for regional climate and weather patterns, influencing agricultural productivity, water availability, and human settlements."}, {"question": "In the context of global temperature distribution, how does the heat capacity of water influence the annual temperature range of the oceans compared to the continents?", "answer": "The high heat capacity of water means that the annual temperature range of the oceans is much less than that of the continents. This results in the equatorward dip of the isotherms over the ocean in summer, as the oceans are cooler than the land, and the poleward dip in winter, as the oceans are warmer than the land. This phenomenon has a moderating effect on coastal climates, reducing the extremes of temperature experienced in inland areas."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the distribution of solar radiation and the global distribution of mean temperature, and how is it modified by the distribution of continents and oceans?", "answer": "The global distribution of mean temperature is strongly related to the average receipt of solar radiation and hence to latitude. However, this relationship is modified by the distribution of continents and oceans, which affects the temperature distribution through the heat capacity of water and the resulting differences in temperature between land and sea. This modification leads to regional variations in temperature, such as the very cold winter temperatures in the centers of the North American and Asiatic landmasses, which are due to radiational cooling and distance from the relatively warm oceans."}, {"question": "Why do the centers of the North American and Asiatic landmasses experience very cold winter temperatures, and what are the implications for atmospheric pressure and weather patterns?", "answer": "The centers of the North American and Asiatic landmasses experience very cold winter temperatures due to radiational cooling and distance from the relatively warm oceans. This leads to the formation of cells of high density and high pressure, which in turn influence the atmospheric circulation and weather patterns.

They dominate the atmospheric transfer at higher latitudes, above latitude 30°, and are responsible for the majority of poleward atmospheric energy transfer in these regions. This is in contrast to the general circulation, which is more significant at lower latitudes, and highlights the importance of these eddies in shaping regional climate and weather patterns."}]}

{"paragraph": "2.1.6.1 El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The best known system of teleconnections, and the  only  one  that  is  truly  global  in  extent,  is  called the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a quasi- cyclic, wave-like phenomenon with a period of three to seven years that has persisted for at least the last 450 years (Rasmussen 1985; Enfield 1989). This phe- nomenon consists of an oscillation between a warm phase  (“El  Niño”),  during  which  abnormally  high sea-surface  temperatures  (SSTs)  occur  off  the  coast of  accompanied  by  low  atmospheric  pressure over  the  eastern  Pacific  and  high  pressure  in  the western Pacific, and a cold phase (“La Niña”) with low SST in the eastern Pacific and the opposite pres- sure  anomalies.  There  is  considerable  evidence  that ENSO is an inherently oscillatory phenomenon that requires no outside forcing. The  typical  ENSO  warm  episode  begins  in  the late  spring  to  fall  of  year  1  with  abnormally  strong westerly  winds  in  the  equatorial  Indian  Ocean,  low pressures in eastern Australia, and warming SSTs in the South Pacific. As winter progresses, a tongue of abnormally warm water forms off the coast of Peru; this intensifies and builds westward along the equa- tor  during  the  spring  and  summer  of  year  2.  The peak of the warm phase usually occurs between July and December of year 2, with abnormally high SSTs extending  westward  to  the  international  date  line. These are accompanied by abnormal westerly winds and strong convergence along the equator, high pres- sures  and  lowered  sea  levels  in  the  western  Pacific and  Indonesia,  and  low  pressures  and  elevated  sea levels  in  the  eastern  Pacific.  A  pool  of  abnormally cold water and enhanced westerly winds also occur near latitude 45° in the North Pacific. The decline of the warm phase typically begins in January to April of year 3, when the equatorial pool of high SSTs be- gins to shrink, and most of the SST, wind, and pres- sure anomalies dissipate by the end of the summer of The end of an ENSO warm phase begins when the  eastward  waves  of  warm  water  are  reflected  off South America and, in a complicated process that in- volves  poleward  circulation  of  the  reflected  west- ward-moving  surface  water  and  atmospheric processes,  the  SST  returns  to  its  original  levels  and the easterly trade wind flow is reestablished (Enfield 1989). Continued cooling of SSTs in the eastern Pa- cific leads to the cold phase of ENSO (La Niña). The  atmospheric  pressure  fluctuations  associ- ated with the changes in SSTs shift the jet stream in the eastern North Pacific and North America to the south  (warm  phase)  or  north  (cold  phase).  These shifts  can  steer  unusual  weather  systems  into  low- and midlatitude regions around the world. The result is  unusually  warm  or  cold  winters  in  particular  re- gions,  drought  in  normally  productive  agricultural areas,  and  torrential  rains  in  normally  arid  regions (Rasmussen  1985).  Some  of  the  teleconnections  as- sociated  with  ENSO  episodes  are  indicated  in  fig- ures  2.15  and  2.16  on  pp.  64  and  65;  the  most consistent  are  the  severe  droughts  in  Australia  and northern South America and heavy rainfall in Ecua- dor  and  northern  Peru.  In  other  places  the  effects can vary from episode to episode depending on the state of the atmosphere. For example, the 1976–1977 event  was  associated  with  drought  along  the  West Coast of the United States, while that of 1982–1983 produced  increased  storminess  (Enfield  1989).  The severe drought in the north-central United States in the summer of 1988 was a consequence of the 1986– 1987 ENSO event (Trenberth et al. 1988). The strong 1997–1998 event produced warm and dry conditions from  India  to  northern  Australia  (leading  to  exten- sive  forest  fires  in  Indonesia);  dry  conditions  in  the eastern Amazon region; a wet winter with consider- able flooding along the West, Gulf, and South Atlan- tic Coasts of the United States; and a warm winter in the northeastern United States. A number of studies have  found  relationships  between  streamflows  and ENSO cycles (e.g., Dracup and Kahya 1994; Eltahir 1996; Amarasekera et al. 1997; Piechota et al. 1997). Since  ENSO  anomaly  patterns  persist  for  several months, useful long-range hydrological forecasts can be  made  for  the  regions  shown  in  figures  2.15  and 2.16 (Halpert and Ropelewski 1992). Because  ENSO  is  such  a  large-scale  process  in- volving the ocean and atmosphere, it likely influences, and is influenced by, warming due to anthropogenic Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone greenhouse-gas  production  (Sun  and  Bryan  2010). Current  information  on  ENSO  is  given  at  http:// www.elnino.noaa.gov.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), what are the primary phases and their characteristics?", "answer": "The primary phases of ENSO are the warm phase (\"El Niño\") and the cold phase (\"La Niña\"). The warm phase is characterized by abnormally high sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) off the coast of South America, low atmospheric pressure over the eastern Pacific, and high pressure in the western Pacific. In contrast, the cold phase is marked by low SSTs in the eastern Pacific and the opposite pressure anomalies."}, {"question": "How does the ENSO phenomenon influence weather patterns globally, and what are the implications for hydrology?", "answer": "The ENSO phenomenon influences weather patterns globally by shifting the jet stream in the eastern North Pacific and North America, which can steer unusual weather systems into low- and midlatitude regions around the world. This results in unusually warm or cold winters in particular regions, drought in normally productive agricultural areas, and torrential rains in normally arid regions. For hydrology, this means that ENSO can have significant impacts on streamflows, leading to droughts or floods, and thus affecting water availability and management. The persistence of ENSO anomaly patterns for several months allows for useful long-range hydrological forecasts."}, {"question": "Why does the decline of the ENSO warm phase typically begin in January to April of year 3, and what are the associated atmospheric and oceanic processes?", "answer": "The decline of the ENSO warm phase typically begins in January to April of year 3 when the equatorial pool of high SSTs begins to shrink. This decline is associated with the reflection of eastward waves of warm water off South America, which involves poleward circulation of the reflected westward-moving surface water and atmospheric processes. As a result, the SST returns to its original levels, and the easterly trade wind flow is reestablished, leading to the end of the warm phase and potentially the onset of the cold phase (La Niña)."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological forecasting, how do relationships between streamflows and ENSO cycles enable long-range predictions, and what are the benefits for water management?", "answer": "Relationships between streamflows and ENSO cycles enable long-range hydrological forecasts because ENSO anomaly patterns persist for several months. This persistence allows for the prediction of streamflow conditions in regions affected by ENSO, providing valuable information for water management. The benefits include improved planning for droughts or floods, more efficient allocation of water resources, and enhanced preparedness for extreme weather events, ultimately contributing to more resilient and sustainable water management practices."}, {"question": "What are the implications of ENSO being a large-scale process involving the ocean and atmosphere for its interaction with anthropogenic greenhouse-gas production?", "answer": "The fact that ENSO is a large-scale process involving the ocean and atmosphere implies that it likely influences, and is influenced by, warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse-gas production. This interaction suggests that ENSO's impacts on global climate patterns and hydrology may be modified by climate change, potentially leading to more extreme or unpredictable ENSO events. Understanding this interaction is crucial for predicting future climate and hydrological changes and for developing effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to these changes."}, {"question": "How do the atmospheric pressure fluctuations associated with ENSO phases affect the jet stream and, consequently, weather patterns in different regions?", "answer": "The atmospheric pressure fluctuations associated with ENSO phases shift the jet stream in the eastern North Pacific and North America to the south during the warm phase or to the north during the cold phase. This shift can steer unusual weather systems into low- and midlatitude regions around the world, resulting in regional weather anomalies such as droughts, floods, or temperature extremes. The specific effects can vary from episode to episode, depending on the state of the atmosphere, but consistent patterns include severe droughts in Australia and northern South America and heavy rainfall in Ecuador and northern Peru during ENSO events."}, {"question": "In the context of ENSO's impact on hydrology, why are some regions more consistently affected than others, and what factors contribute to this variability?", "answer": "Some regions are more consistently affected by ENSO than others due to their geographical location and the resulting exposure to the atmospheric and oceanic anomalies associated with ENSO phases. Factors contributing to this variability include the persistence and intensity of ENSO events, the state of the atmosphere during these events, and the regional characteristics of the hydrological systems. For example, areas like Australia and northern South America tend to experience severe droughts during ENSO events, while regions like Ecuador and northern Peru receive heavy rainfall. This variability highlights the need for region-specific hydrological forecasts and water management strategies that account for ENSO's impacts."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.1.6.2 North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Two  of  the  most  prominent,  persistent  features of atmospheric pressure in the Northern Hemisphere are the Icelandic Low (figure 2.12a) and the Azores High  (figure  2.12b).  Wallace  and  Gutzler  (1981) showed that there is a strong correlation between the strengths  of  these  two  features:  An  abnormally  in- tense/weak Icelandic Low tends to occur with an ab- normally  intense/weak  Azores  High.  This  is  the dominant  mode  of  atmospheric-pressure  variability in  the  North  Atlantic  region  (Hurrell  1995),  and  is called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The strength of the NAO is characterized by the index,  which  is  defined  as  the  difference  be- tween normalized monthly sea-level-pressure anom- alies at  weather stations  in  the Azores  and Iceland, and  characterizes  the  steepness  of  a  north-south  at- mospheric pressure gradient across the North Atlan- tic  Ocean  (figures  2.17  and  2.18  on  p.  66).  In  its positive  mode,  the  gradient  is  steep  and  the  jet stream  and  weather  systems  moving  across  eastern North America and the North Atlantic tend to paral- lel latitude lines (zonal flow). The negative phase of the NAO index corresponds to a weaker north-south pressure  gradient,  and  the  jet  stream  and  weather systems tend to encounter “blocking” that induces a meandering  path  with  a  longitudinal  component (meridional flow). When the NAO shifts between its modes of vari- ability, the North Atlantic Ocean experiences changes in wind speed and direction that affect heat and mois- ture transport to the surrounding continents and seas (Hurrell  1995).  As  documented  by  Visbeck  et  al.

According to Bradbury et al.

While we may recognize that we are connected in an ecological sense to the rest of the world—that we depend upon it to supply the food, clothing, and shelter that are essential for our exis- tence—we think of the environment as being “out there.” In fact, each of us is part of the great biogeochem- ical cycles that have moved matter and energy through the global ecosystem for billions of years. None of the atoms that currently constitute your body was part of you at birth; each atom has a finite residence time within you before it leaves to continue its ceaseless cycling. Table 2B1.1 shows the amounts of water in typical humans and the rates of intake of water from various sources. For adults, the average rate of output (via breathing, perspiration, urine, and feces) is essentially equal to the average rate of input. As we have done for other reservoirs, we can calculate the average residence time of water in the typical human male and female using equation (1.25).

Thus, on the average, the water in your body is completely replaced every two weeks.

The major  causes of these  deviations  are  mountain  ranges,  such  as  the Rocky–Andean  Mountain  chain,  the  Alps,  and  the Himalayas. These ranges induce high rates of precip- itation in their immediate vicinity and typically pro- duce  “rain-shadow”  zones  of  reduced  precipitation over  large  areas  leeward  of  the  prevailing  winds. Note, for example, the dry zone in the Great Plains of  North  America  extending  from  latitude  20°  to above latitude 60°, and the effects of the Himalayas in blocking moisture-laden winds from reaching the interior of Asia. Recent research has documented the importance of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to the distribution of pre- cipitation  in  the  midlatitudes  (Ralph  and  Dettinger 2011). ARs are narrow corridors of concentrated wa- ter-vapor transport in the lower atmosphere extending across long stretches of the ocean (figure 2.24). They are quantitatively defined as having (1) vertically inte- grated water-vapor concentrations equivalent to 2 or more  cm  of  liquid  water;  (2)  wind  speeds  of  greater than 12.5 m/s in the lowest 2 km; and (3) a long (sev- eral thousand km) and narrow (less than 400–500 km wide)  shape.  Where  ARs  encounter  mountainous coasts,  such  as  the  Pacific  Coast  of  North  America, they  can  cause  extreme  precipitation  and  flooding, and make important contributions to the annual rain and  snowfall.  Understanding  the  behavior  of  ARs may shed light on how changing climate patterns in- fluence extreme precipitation and floods. The  seasonal  distribution  of  precipitation,  in- cluding  its  occurrence  in  the  form  of  rain  or  snow, has  important  hydrologic  and  climatic  implications Figure 2.23 Global aver- age annual precipitation rate (dm/yr) [Peixoto and Oort (1992).

Figure  2.25 shows the global distribution of seven general precip- itation  regimes.  The  reversal  of  circulation  associ- ated  with  the  development  of  winter  high  pressure and summer low pressure over the huge land mass of Asia interacts with the topography and the migration of the ITCZ to produce a particularly strong season- ality of precipitation in much of Asia and Africa; this is the monsoon. Figure  2.26  on  p.  73  shows  the  global  distribu- tion  and duration of seasonal snow cover. Much  of the Northern Hemisphere land surface above 40° lat- itude has a seasonal snow cover of significant dura- tion; in the Southern Hemisphere snow occurs only in mountainous areas and Antarctica. The principal hydrologic  effect  of  snow  is  to  shape  the  seasonal distribution of runoff by delaying the release of pre- cipitated  water.  In  many  places—notably  much  of western  North  America—runoff  from  snowmelt provides most of the water used for domestic supply and irrigation. In addition to direct impacts on water resources, the  extent,  duration,  and  depth  of  seasonal  snow cover  play  a  major  role  in  providing  feedbacks  be- tween  climate  and  hydrology.  Snow  helps  to  main- tain  colder  temperatures  by  reflecting  much  of  the incoming  solar  energy  (see  table  2.4)  and,  in  melt- ing, by absorbing energy that would otherwise con- tribute  to  warming  the  near-surface  environment. The surface cooling induced by snow has profound effects on surface and air temperatures, global circu- lation  patterns  and  storm  tracks,  and  precipitation (Berry  1981;  Dey  and  Kumar  1983;  Dickson  1984; Walsh 1984; Barnett et al. 1988; Leathers and Rob- inson 1993; Groisman et al. 1994). Snow also acts as an insulating blanket that helps to retain heat in the soil, which is important hydrologically as well as bi- ologically:  If  the  soil  is  prevented  from  freezing,  its ability  to  accept  infiltrating  meltwater  is  generally enhanced  (Dingman  1975).  The  insulating  effect  of snow  is  also  important  in  maintaining  perennially frozen ground (permafrost), which is a major hydro- logic  feature  in  much  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere (section  2.3.1).  The  extent,  duration,  and  depth  of seasonal  snow  cover  are  very  sensitive  to  climate change  (section  2.2.8),  and  due  to  the  feedback  ef- fects noted above, any changes in its extent and du- ration will induce further changes in global climate and hydrology.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of global precipitation patterns, how do mountain ranges influence precipitation distribution?", "answer": "Mountain ranges induce high rates of precipitation in their immediate vicinity and typically produce \"rain-shadow\" zones of reduced precipitation over large areas leeward of the prevailing winds.

The resulting precipitation patterns show significant deviations from the general latitudinal distribution, highlighting the importance of topography in shaping regional hydrology."}, {"question": "Why do regions characterized by rising air tend to have relatively high average precipitation?", "answer": "Regions characterized by rising air tend to have relatively high average precipitation because as air rises, it cools, and cooling air can hold less moisture, leading to condensation and precipitation. This process is particularly pronounced near the equator and at 60° latitude, where the general circulation produces belts of relatively high precipitation. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is a notable example, where warm easterly winds from both hemispheres converge, carrying large amounts of moisture evaporated from tropical oceans."}, {"question": "In the context of the global hydrologic cycle, what role do atmospheric rivers play in precipitation distribution?", "answer": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of concentrated water-vapor transport in the lower atmosphere that can cause extreme precipitation and flooding when they encounter mountainous coasts.

The occurrence of precipitation in the form of rain or snow affects soil formation, vegetation, and the timing of runoff. In many places, runoff from snowmelt provides most of the water used for domestic supply and irrigation, highlighting the importance of understanding seasonal precipitation patterns for water resource management. Furthermore, the extent, duration, and depth of seasonal snow cover play a major role in providing feedbacks between climate and hydrology, influencing surface and air temperatures, global circulation patterns, and precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of human water content, what is the average residence time of water in the human body?", "answer": "The average residence time of water in the human body is approximately 14 days, meaning that the water in the body is completely replaced every two weeks.

Understanding human water content and its dynamics is essential for appreciating the interconnectedness of the global hydrologic cycle and the role of humans within it."}, {"question": "Why do areas with seasonal snow cover exhibit distinct hydrologic characteristics?", "answer": "Areas with seasonal snow cover exhibit distinct hydrologic characteristics because snow acts as a natural reservoir, delaying the release of precipitated water and shaping the seasonal distribution of runoff. The extent, duration, and depth of seasonal snow cover also play a crucial role in providing feedbacks between climate and hydrology, influencing surface and air temperatures, global circulation patterns, and precipitation. Additionally, snow cover helps to maintain colder temperatures by reflecting incoming solar energy and absorbing energy during melting, which has profound effects on the environment and ecosystems."}, {"question": "In the context of the global hydrologic cycle, how do changes in seasonal snow cover extent and duration impact climate and hydrology?", "answer": "Changes in the extent and duration of seasonal snow cover have significant implications for climate and hydrology, as they induce further changes in global climate and hydrology through feedback effects. The insulating effect of snow helps to retain heat in the soil, enhancing its ability to accept infiltrating meltwater, while the surface cooling induced by snow affects surface and air temperatures, global circulation patterns, and precipitation.

This convergence leads to high rates of precipitation, particularly near the equator, and is a key factor in shaping the global distribution of precipitation. The ITCZ is also influenced by the general circulation of the atmosphere, which produces belts of relatively high precipitation near the equator and 60° latitude."}]}

As  expected,  there  is  a  general  correlation  between mean  annual  temperature  and  mean  annual  evapo- transpiration  (compare  figure  2.14).  In  the  oceans, the basic latitudinal patterns are distorted largely by the effects of surface currents (e.g., note the effect of the warm Gulf Stream off northern Europe and the cold currents flowing equatorward off western South America and North America). The highest continen- tal  values  are  in  the  tropical  rain  forests  of  South America, Africa, and southeast Asia, while the low- est are in the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, arctic North America, and central Asia. On  land  surfaces,  the  climatic  evaporative  de- mand, which is chiefly a function of solar radiation, humidity,  and  wind,  is  called  the potential  evapo- transpiration; more specific definitions and ways of calculating this quantity are discussed in chapter 6. Thus,  actual  evapotranspiration  on  land  may  be  ei- ther  energy-limited,  where  potential  evapotranspi- ration is less than the precipitation (humid regions); or  water-limited,  where  potential  evapotranspira- tion  exceeds  precipitation  (arid  regions).  As  shown in figure 2.28, well over half the global land area is water-limited.

This is reflected in the similarity between the overall pattern of latitudinally averaged evapotranspiration and the patterns of radiation balance and temperature. The energy availability is a key factor in determining the maximum evapotranspiration rates, which occur in the Southern Hemisphere tropics due to the large area of the Pacific Ocean in these latitudes."}, {"question": "Why do the highest continental evapotranspiration values occur in tropical rain forests?", "answer": "The highest continental evapotranspiration values are found in the tropical rain forests of South America, Africa, and southeast Asia because these regions have high temperatures and ample precipitation, which together create an environment conducive to high levels of evapotranspiration. The combination of high solar radiation, humidity, and wind in these areas supports dense vegetation, which in turn enhances transpiration. This results in high actual evapotranspiration rates, as the potential evapotranspiration in these humid regions is often met or exceeded by the available precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of land surfaces, what determines whether evapotranspiration is energy-limited or water-limited?", "answer": "On land surfaces, evapotranspiration is determined to be either energy-limited or water-limited based on the relationship between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation. In humid regions, where potential evapotranspiration is less than the precipitation, evapotranspiration is energy-limited. Conversely, in arid regions where potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, evapotranspiration is water-limited. This distinction is critical because it influences the actual rate of evapotranspiration, with energy-limited regions having evapotranspiration rates constrained by the availability of energy, and water-limited regions having rates constrained by the availability of water."}, {"question": "How does the distribution of oceanic evaporation and continental evapotranspiration relate to mean annual temperature?", "answer": "There is a general correlation between mean annual temperature and mean annual evapotranspiration. This relationship is observed in both oceanic evaporation and continental evapotranspiration, although the basic latitudinal patterns in the oceans are distorted by the effects of surface currents. The correlation suggests that temperature plays a significant role in determining evapotranspiration rates, with higher temperatures typically leading to higher evapotranspiration rates due to the increased energy availability for the phase change process."}, {"question": "Why are the lowest continental evapotranspiration values found in the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, arctic North America, and central Asia?", "answer": "The lowest continental evapotranspiration values are found in these regions due to their arid or cold conditions, which significantly limit the availability of water for evapotranspiration. In the Sahara Desert and other arid regions, the lack of precipitation results in water-limited conditions, where potential evapotranspiration far exceeds the available water, leading to low actual evapotranspiration rates. In cold regions like Antarctica and arctic North America, the low temperatures and short growing seasons restrict the growth of vegetation and reduce the energy available for evapotranspiration, also resulting in low rates. Central Asia, being a mix of arid and cold conditions, experiences similar limitations, leading to low evapotranspiration values."}, {"question": "In what proportion of the global land area is evapotranspiration water-limited?", "answer": "Well over half of the global land area is water-limited, meaning that in these regions, the potential evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation. This indicates that a significant portion of the Earth's land surface faces challenges related to water scarcity, which can impact vegetation growth, agricultural productivity, and overall ecosystem health. The prevalence of water-limited conditions underscores the importance of understanding and managing water resources effectively to mitigate the effects of drought and ensure sustainable use of water in these areas."}, {"question": "How do surface currents affect the latitudinal patterns of oceanic evaporation?", "answer": "Surface currents distort the basic latitudinal patterns of oceanic evaporation. For example, the warm Gulf Stream off northern Europe and the cold currents flowing equatorward off western South America and North America alter the expected latitudinal distribution of evaporation. These currents can either enhance or reduce evaporation rates in specific areas by modifying the sea surface temperature and, consequently, the energy available for evaporation. This highlights the complex interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes in determining evapotranspiration patterns."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.2.4 Distribution of Runoff Figure 2.29 shows the global distribution of an- nual runoff, i.e., the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration for the continents. This map shows a close correspondence with annual precipita- tion  (figure  2.23)  and  with  areas  of  energy-limited and  water-limited  evapotranspiration  (figure  2.28). The highest average runoff rates, near 3,000 mm/yr, occur  on the  east  coast  of  the  Bay  of Bengal,  while the Amazon Basin of northern South America is the largest region with runoff exceeding 1,000 mm/yr.

In  most  areas  that  have  a  seasonal snow cover or are glacierized, the maximum runoff occurs in the melt season: summer in arctic, subarc- tic, and alpine regions, and spring at lower latitudes. A  summer  maximum  also  occurs  in  regions  with monsoonal  climates,  such  as  India  and  southeast Asia,  and  other  areas  with  summer  precipitation maximums  (figure  2.25).

More recent discussions of the season- ality  of  global  runoff  are  given  by  Kuhl  and  Miller ich (2011). Note that the seasonal pattern of runoff is com- monly quite different from that of precipitation, due to the seasonality of evapotranspiration and the stor- age of precipitation as snow. In northeastern United States,  for  example,  precipitation  is  equally  distrib- uted through the year, but 25% of the annual runoff typically  occurs  during  one  spring  month  and  only 10%  in  the  three  months  of  summer.  The  effect  of snowmelt  in  concentrating  the  period  of  runoff  be- comes more pronounced the longer the annual snow cover persists; in northern Alaska one-half of the an- nual runoff occurs in a three- to 10-day period (Ding- man et al. 1980).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of global runoff distribution, what are the highest average runoff rates and where do they occur?", "answer": "The highest average runoff rates, near 3,000 mm/yr, occur on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal."}, {"question": "How does the seasonal pattern of runoff differ from that of precipitation, and what are the underlying reasons for this difference?", "answer": "The seasonal pattern of runoff is commonly quite different from that of precipitation due to the seasonality of evapotranspiration and the storage of precipitation as snow. This difference is pronounced in regions with seasonal snow cover or glaciers, where the maximum runoff occurs during the melt season. For instance, in northeastern United States, precipitation is equally distributed throughout the year, but a significant portion of the annual runoff occurs during a single spring month, highlighting the impact of snowmelt on runoff patterns."}, {"question": "In areas with monsoonal climates, why does the maximum runoff occur during the summer season?", "answer": "In regions with monsoonal climates, such as India and southeast Asia, the maximum runoff occurs during the summer season because of the summer precipitation maximums. This is a direct relationship where the increased rainfall during the summer months leads to higher runoff."}, {"question": "What is the effect of snowmelt on the concentration of runoff periods, and how does this vary with the duration of annual snow cover?", "answer": "Snowmelt has a significant effect on concentrating the period of runoff, making it more pronounced the longer the annual snow cover persists. For example, in northern Alaska, one-half of the annual runoff occurs in a remarkably short period of just three to 10 days, illustrating the extreme concentration of runoff due to prolonged snow cover."}, {"question": "In the context of water-limited and energy-limited evapotranspiration, how does the distribution of annual runoff relate to these factors?", "answer": "The distribution of annual runoff shows a close correspondence with areas of energy-limited and water-limited evapotranspiration. This relationship indicates that runoff patterns are influenced by the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, with higher runoff in areas where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration capacity."}, {"question": "Why do fall and winter runoff maxima occur in certain regions, and what are the underlying climatic factors?", "answer": "Fall and winter runoff maxima are directly related to concurrent rainfall patterns. In regions where the majority of the precipitation falls during these seasons, the runoff maxima will also occur during the same periods, reflecting the direct relationship between rainfall and runoff."}, {"question": "How does the Amazon Basin compare to other regions in terms of runoff, and what makes it notable?", "answer": "The Amazon Basin is notable for being the largest region with runoff exceeding 1,000 mm/yr, making it a significant area for hydrological studies. Its large size and high runoff rates underscore the importance of this region in the global hydrological cycle."}, {"question": "In the context of seasonal runoff regimes, what factors determine the season in which the most runoff occurs, and how is the degree of concentration of runoff in that season classified?", "answer": "The season in which the most runoff occurs is determined by factors such as the presence of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, and the timing of precipitation maximums. The degree of concentration of runoff in that season is classified based on the percentage of annual runoff that occurs during the peak season, with categories including more than 80%, 50 to 80%, and less than 50%. This classification helps in understanding the variability and predictability of runoff patterns across different regions."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the seasonal pattern of runoff important for hydrological studies, and what implications does it have for water resource management?", "answer": "Understanding the seasonal pattern of runoff is crucial for hydrological studies because it helps in predicting water availability and managing water resources effectively. The implications of this understanding are significant for water resource management, as it allows for better planning and allocation of water resources, especially in regions with variable and unpredictable runoff patterns. For instance, knowing when and how much runoff to expect can inform decisions on reservoir management, irrigation scheduling, and flood control measures, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and resilient water management practices."}, {"question": "How do the concepts of energy-limited and water-limited evapotranspiration influence the global distribution of runoff, and what are the key factors that determine these limitations?", "answer": "The concepts of energy-limited and water-limited evapotranspiration play a crucial role in shaping the global distribution of runoff. Energy-limited evapotranspiration occurs in regions where the energy available for evaporation is the limiting factor, typically in humid and tropical areas. On the other hand, water-limited evapotranspiration is characteristic of arid and semi-arid regions where the availability of water is the primary constraint. The key factors that determine these limitations include climate, soil moisture, and vegetation cover, which interact to influence the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration"}]}

This knowledge helps in assessing the potential for water supply, irrigation, and other water-dependent activities. Furthermore, it allows for the identification of areas with water scarcity or surplus, enabling targeted interventions to mitigate water-related challenges."}, {"question": "What implications does the variation in average runoff rate among continents have for regional water management strategies?", "answer": "The variation in average runoff rate among continents implies that regional water management strategies must be tailored to the specific hydrological characteristics of each region. This means that strategies effective in one region may not be suitable for another, due to differences in water availability. For instance, regions with high runoff rates like South America may focus on managing excess water and preventing floods, while regions with low runoff rates like Australia may prioritize water conservation and efficient use. This highlights the need for adaptive and region-specific approaches to water resource management."}, {"question": "How do the differences in precipitation and runoff among continents affect the overall water balance of each region?", "answer": "The differences in precipitation and runoff among continents significantly affect the overall water balance of each region. Precipitation is the primary input to the water balance, and variations in precipitation rates influence the amount of water available for runoff, infiltration, and evapotranspiration. Regions with high precipitation rates, such as South America, tend to have higher runoff rates, while regions with low precipitation rates, such as Antarctica, have lower runoff rates. This, in turn, affects the water balance, with implications for water availability, ecosystem health, and human activities that depend on water."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological processes, why is it essential to consider the spatial variability of runoff rates within each continent?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the spatial variability of runoff rates within each continent because it affects the local water balance and the availability of water resources. The spatial variability of runoff rates is influenced by factors such as topography, land use, and climate, which can lead to significant differences in water availability within a continent. For example, a continent like South America, which is generally wet, may have areas with low runoff rates due to local conditions such as high evapotranspiration or water diversion for human activities. Understanding this spatial variability is crucial for effective water resource management, as it allows for the identification of areas with water scarcity or surplus and the development of targeted strategies to address these issues."}, {"question": "What are the challenges posed by the driest continent, Antarctica, in terms of water resource management?", "answer": "Antarctica poses significant challenges in terms of water resource management due to its extremely low precipitation rates, making it the driest continent. The low water availability limits the potential for human activities, research, and ecosystem support, requiring specialized strategies for water conservation and efficient use. Moreover, the unique and fragile Antarctic environment necessitates careful management to prevent contamination and protect the delicate ecosystem, adding to the complexity of water resource management in this region. The challenges in Antarctica highlight the importance of adaptive and innovative approaches to water management in regions with extreme hydrological conditions."}, {"question": "How does the comparison between continents in terms of runoff per unit area inform water resource planning and management?", "answer": "The comparison between continents in terms of runoff per unit area provides valuable insights for water resource planning and management. By understanding which continents have high or low runoff rates, planners and managers can assess the potential for water supply, identify areas prone to water scarcity or flooding, and develop strategies to mitigate these issues. For example, continents with low runoff rates like Australia may need to focus on water conservation, efficient use, and possibly desalination or water recycling, while continents with high runoff rates like South America may need to manage excess water through flood control measures and water storage infrastructure. This comparison enables the development of continent-specific and even region-specific water management strategies, tailored to the unique hydrological characteristics of each area."}]}

Table 2.8 shows the average discharges and drainage areas of the 16 largest rivers in the world (ranked by discharge); figure 2.31 shows their locations. Together, these rivers drain 22.9% of the world’s land area and contribute 32.8% of the to- tal runoff to the oceans; the Amazon River alone de- livers 16% of the total runoff. (Note that only rivers draining  directly  to  the  ocean  are  included  in  table 2.8;  there  are  tributaries  of  the  Amazon  that  have larger discharges than many of the rivers listed.) Most  natural  and  artificial  lakes  are  through- flowing,  receiving  surface  and  ground-water  runoff and  discharging  to  rivers;  some  in  arid  areas  are drainage termini and lose water only by evaporation. The main hydrologic functions of natural and man- made  lakes  are:  (1)  to  provide  storage  that  reduces the  time  variability  of  flow  in  the  rivers  that  drain them (figure 1.18); (2) to increase the travel time of runoff, inducing loss of sediment load and other wa- ter-quality changes (Vörösmarty et al. 1997); and (3) to  increase  evaporation  by  providing  large  perma- nently  wet  surfaces.  Fresh-water  lakes  hold  about two years’ worth of global runoff, cover about 2.4% of the earth’s unglacierized land surface (Lehner and Döll 2004), and contribute about 3% of the total land evapotranspiration  (L’vovich  1974).

Lastly, variables affecting sediment load, such as land-use conditions and reservoir construction, commonly change over time, introducing further uncertainty into the estimates."}, {"question": "In the context of material transport, what is the relationship between the concentration of a material constituent and the water discharge, and how is it represented?", "answer": "The relationship between the concentration of a material constituent (C) and the water discharge (Q) is given by the equation = C · Q, where is the constituent load. This equation shows that the load of a material constituent is directly proportional to both its concentration and the water discharge."}, {"question": "How do factors such as climate, geology, topography, and vegetation influence material transport by rivers, and what are the implications for global estimates?", "answer": "Climate, geology, topography, and vegetation are all factors that influence material transport by rivers. Understanding the relationships between these factors and material transport is crucial for making accurate global estimates. However, due to the complexity and variability of these factors across different regions, it is challenging to establish precise global relations. This challenge is compounded by the uncertainty in estimating material transport rates, particularly for particulates, as discussed earlier."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the uncertainty in estimates of material transport to the oceans, especially when evaluating the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems?", "answer": "Considering the uncertainty in estimates of material transport to the oceans is important because it affects our understanding of the impact of human activities, such as pollution and land-use changes, on marine ecosystems. High uncertainty can lead to inaccurate assessments of the severity of environmental issues, such as the degradation of marine ecosystems due to excessive nutrient delivery. Therefore, acknowledging and addressing this uncertainty is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate these impacts and protect marine ecosystems."}, {"question": "In the context of biogeochemical cycles, how do rivers contribute to the maintenance of lake and ocean ecosystems, and what elements are involved?", "answer": "Rivers contribute to the maintenance of lake and ocean ecosystems by transporting essential elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, sulfur, and many other minerals. These elements are part of biogeochemical cycles and are crucial for the health and productivity of aquatic ecosystems. The transport of these elements by rivers helps maintain the balance of nutrients in lakes and oceans, supporting the diverse range of life within these ecosystems."}, {"question": "How do human activities, such as the construction of reservoirs and changes in land-use conditions, affect sediment load and material transport by rivers?", "answer": "Human activities like the construction of reservoirs and changes in land-use conditions can significantly affect sediment load and material transport by rivers. Reservoirs can trap sediments, reducing the amount of material transported downstream, while changes in land use can increase erosion and sediment yield. These alterations can have profound impacts on river dynamics and the ecosystems they support, highlighting the need for careful management and consideration of these factors in river basin planning and conservation efforts."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment yield, what does the term refer to, and how is it related to material transport by rivers?", "answer": "Sediment yield refers to the load of sediment per unit drainage area. It is a measure of the amount of sediment transported by a river from its catchment area. Sediment yield is an important indicator of the erosive processes occurring within a river basin and is influenced by factors such as climate, geology, topography, and land use.

However, composition varies widely in different regions, largely due to varia- tions  in  rock  type  and  climate  (Berner  and  Berner 1987). Gibbs (1970) showed that rivers draining areas with high annual precipitation and runoff tend to have low  total  dissolved  concentrations  and  compositions similar to that of precipitation (i.e., they are relatively rich in sodium [Na] and chlorine [Cl]) and largely in- dependent  of  rock  type.

Rivers draining areas with high annual precipitation and runoff tend to have low total dissolved concentrations and compositions similar to that of precipitation, while those in drier climates have higher concentrations and compositions controlled by fractional crystallization due to evaporation."}, {"question": "Why do rivers in climates with moderate precipitation and runoff have moderate levels of dissolved concentrations?", "answer": "Rivers in climates with moderate precipitation and runoff have moderate levels of dissolved concentrations because the composition is dominated by rock type, which tends to be high in calcium (Ca) and bicarbonate (HCO3). This is in contrast to rivers in high-precipitation areas, where the composition is more similar to that of precipitation, and rivers in drier climates, where the composition is controlled by fractional crystallization due to evaporation."}, {"question": "In the context of dissolved load, what is the global variation of total dissolved load for major river basins?", "answer": "The global variation of total dissolved load for major river basins shows that average dissolved-sediment yields range from less than 1 T/km2·yr to 750 T/km2·yr, with an average of about 40 T/km2·yr. The high loads in southern Asia reflect the high discharges in those regions, while those in central Europe are due to widespread soluble rocks, especially limestones."}, {"question": "How does the presence of crystalline rocks with low solubilities affect the dissolved loads on continents?", "answer": "The presence of crystalline rocks with low solubilities in much of Africa and Australia gives rise to generally low dissolved loads on those continents. This is because the low solubility of these rocks results in less dissolved material being released into the rivers, leading to lower dissolved loads."}, {"question": "In the context of river chemistry, why do rivers in drier climates tend to have higher concentrations of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl)?", "answer": "Rivers in drier climates tend to have higher concentrations of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) because the water chemistry becomes increasingly controlled by fractional crystallization due to evaporation. As water evaporates, the concentration of dissolved solids increases, and the composition shifts from Ca-HCO3 toward Na-Cl, resulting in higher concentrations of these ions."}, {"question": "What is the ultimate end-member in the progression of river water chemistry as one moves toward drier climates?", "answer": "The ultimate end-member in the progression of river water chemistry as one moves toward drier climates is sea water. This is because the process of fractional crystallization due to evaporation continues to concentrate the dissolved solids, eventually resulting in a composition similar to that of sea water."}, {"question": "In the context of dissolved load, how do the high discharges in southern Asia contribute to the high dissolved loads in that region?", "answer": "The high discharges in southern Asia contribute to the high dissolved loads in that region by transporting large amounts of dissolved material. The combination of readily weathered rocks, high rates of weathering due to high temperatures and precipitation, and high discharges results in high dissolved loads, as seen in the case of the Irrawaddy River."}, {"question": "Why do rivers draining areas with high annual precipitation and runoff tend to have compositions similar to that of precipitation?", "answer": "Rivers draining areas with high annual precipitation and runoff tend to have compositions similar to that of precipitation because the high water flow dilutes the dissolved solids, resulting in a composition that is more similar to that of precipitation. This is in contrast to rivers in drier climates, where the composition is controlled by fractional crystallization due to evaporation."}, {"question": "In the context of river water composition, what is the effect of rock type on the composition of rivers in climates with moderate precipitation and runoff?", "answer": "In climates with moderate precipitation and runoff, the composition of rivers is dominated by rock type, which tends to be high in calcium (Ca) and bicarbonate (HCO3). The rock type plays a significant role in determining the composition of the river water, as it releases dissolved solids into the water through weathering processes."}, {"question": "How does the process of fractional crystallization due to evaporation affect the composition of river water in drier climates?", "answer": "The process of fractional crystallization due to evaporation affects the composition of river water in drier climates by concentrating the dissolved solids and shifting the composition from Ca-HCO3 toward Na-Cl.

{"paragraph": "2.2.7.2 Particulate Material The natural rate of erosion of particulate mate- rial is determined by climate, rock type, topography, tectonic  activity,  and  vegetation.  Wilkinson  (2005) calculated that the current rate of movement of earth materials  by  humans  (principally  through  agricul- ture,  mining,  forest  clearing,  and  construction)  is now more than 10 times the natural geologic rate of 7.2×109 T/yr (about 0.02 mm/yr). Thus these activi- ties have greatly increased global sediment transport in historic times and, along with the effects of lakes and reservoirs acting as sediment traps (also greatly increased  by  humans;  see  Vörösmarty  et  al.  1997 and Graf 1999), strongly affect the global patterns of particulate-sediment yield. Milliman and Syvitski (1992) found that contem- porary particulate-sediment yields range  from 1.2 to 36,000 T/km2 · yr and are positively related to drain- age area, maximum watershed elevation, and runoff (figure 2.35). The highest yields are in areas with sea- sonal-rainfall climates (compare figure 2.25) coupled with active mountain building (India) or highly erod- ible soils (China); high yields are also associated with mountain belts in Alaska, the Andes, and the western Mediterranean  region,  and  in  Taiwan,  the  Philip- pines, and New Zealand, where human activity also plays  a  significant  role  in  sediment  production.  The areas of lowest yields (outside of deserts) are in north- ern  North  America  and  Eurasia,  equatorial  Africa, and  eastern  Australia,  where  low  relief  is  coupled with resistant rocks and/or extensive vegetative cover.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of global sediment transport, how do human activities affect the natural rate of erosion of particulate material?", "answer": "Human activities, such as agriculture, mining, forest clearing, and construction, have increased the rate of movement of earth materials to more than 10 times the natural geologic rate of 7.2×10^9 T/yr. This significant increase has greatly impacted global sediment transport in historic times. The effects of these activities, combined with the influence of lakes and reservoirs acting as sediment traps, have strongly altered the global patterns of particulate-sediment yield."}, {"question": "Why do areas with seasonal-rainfall climates and active mountain building or highly erodible soils exhibit high particulate-sediment yields?", "answer": "Areas with seasonal-rainfall climates, such as India, and those with active mountain building or highly erodible soils, like China, experience high particulate-sediment yields due to the combination of factors that enhance erosion. The seasonal rainfall intensifies runoff, while active mountain building and highly erodible soils increase the susceptibility of the terrain to erosion. This combination of factors results in higher sediment yields in these regions."}, {"question": "In the context of particulate-sediment yield, what is the relationship between drainage area, maximum watershed elevation, and runoff?", "answer": "According to Milliman and Syvitski (1992), particulate-sediment yields are positively related to drainage area, maximum watershed elevation, and runoff. This means that as these factors increase, the sediment yield also tends to increase, indicating a direct correlation between these variables and the amount of sediment transported."}, {"question": "How do lakes and reservoirs influence global sediment transport patterns?", "answer": "Lakes and reservoirs act as sediment traps, which means they capture and store sediment that would otherwise be transported downstream. The increased presence of these water bodies, largely due to human activities, has significantly altered global sediment transport patterns by reducing the amount of sediment that reaches the oceans. This, in turn, affects the overall sediment balance and can have implications for coastal erosion, delta formation, and marine ecosystems."}, {"question": "In regions with low relief, resistant rocks, and extensive vegetative cover, why are particulate-sediment yields generally lower?", "answer": "The combination of low relief, resistant rocks, and extensive vegetative cover in regions such as northern North America and Eurasia, equatorial Africa, and eastern Australia reduces the susceptibility of these areas to erosion. Low relief decreases the potential energy for runoff, resistant rocks are less easily eroded, and vegetative cover protects the soil from erosion. As a result, these regions experience lower particulate-sediment yields compared to areas with more erosive conditions."}, {"question": "What are the implications of human activities on the global patterns of particulate-sediment yield, and how do these activities compare to natural geologic rates?", "answer": "Human activities have significantly increased the global rate of sediment transport, exceeding the natural geologic rate by more than 10 times. This alteration of natural sediment transport patterns can have profound implications for river systems, coastal areas, and marine environments. The increased sediment load can lead to changes in river morphology, enhanced coastal erosion, and impacts on marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the disruption of natural sediment balances can challenge efforts to manage and conserve these environments, highlighting the need for sustainable practices that consider the long-term effects of human activities on the environment."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment production, how does human activity contribute to high yields in certain regions?", "answer": "Human activity plays a significant role in sediment production, particularly in regions such as Taiwan, the Philippines, and New Zealand. Activities like deforestation, agriculture, and construction increase soil erosion and sediment transport, contributing to the high particulate-sediment yields observed in these areas. The impact of human activity on sediment production underscores the importance of considering anthropogenic factors when assessing and managing sediment transport in these regions."}, {"question": "Why are mountain belts, such as those in Alaska, the Andes, and the western Mediterranean region, associated with high particulate-sediment yields?", "answer": "Mountain belts are characterized by steep slopes, high relief, and often, highly erodible soils, which make them prone to erosion. The combination of these factors, along with the potential for high runoff and active tectonic processes, contributes to the high particulate-sediment yields observed in these regions. The rugged terrain and geological activity in mountain belts increase the susceptibility of the landscape to erosion, resulting in higher sediment yields compared to more stable and less erosive environments."}, {"question": "In the context of global sediment transport, how do human activities affect the natural rate of erosion of particulate material?", "answer": "Human activities, such as agriculture, mining, forest clearing, and construction, have increased the rate of movement of earth materials to more than 10"}]}

This combination of factors leads to increased erosion and sediment transport in these regions. The steep terrain facilitates the rapid movement of water and sediment, while high precipitation provides the necessary energy for erosion to occur, resulting in higher sediment yields compared to other continents."}, {"question": "How does the average erosion rate indicated by the total sediment yield compare to the average erosion rate through geologic history?", "answer": "The total sediment yield represents the removal of about 0.06 mm/yr worldwide, which is approximately twice the average erosion rate through geologic history. This suggests that current erosion rates are significantly higher than the long-term average, potentially due to human activities or other factors that have increased erosion in recent times. Understanding this comparison is crucial for assessing the impact of human activities on the environment and for predicting future changes in erosion rates."}, {"question": "In the context of continental differences, why does Europe have the highest dissolved yield, and what is unique about its sediment load composition?", "answer": "Europe has the highest dissolved yield because its specific geological and environmental conditions favor the dissolution of rocks over particulate erosion. Europe is the only continent where dissolved load exceeds particulate load, indicating a dominance of chemical weathering processes over physical erosion. This unique composition of sediment load can be attributed to factors such as the type of rocks present, climate, and human activities that influence the rate of dissolution versus erosion."}, {"question": "What are the factors contributing to Africa having the lowest particulate, dissolved, and total sediment yields?", "answer": "Africa has the lowest particulate, dissolved, and total sediment yields due to its generally low relief, widespread resistant rocks, and extensive desert areas. The low relief reduces the potential for erosion, as there is less terrain for water to flow over and erode. The presence of resistant rocks decreases the rate of erosion, as these rocks are less susceptible to weathering and erosion. Additionally, the extensive desert areas in Africa contribute to low sediment yields, as these regions typically have low precipitation and vegetation cover, further reducing the potential for erosion."}, {"question": "In the context of sediment yield implications, what does the estimated removal of 7.8×10^9 m^3/yr of sediment imply about global erosion rates?", "answer": "The estimated removal of 7.8×10^9 m^3/yr of sediment implies that global erosion rates are significant, with about 0.06 mm/yr of the Earth's surface being eroded annually. This rate is not only a measure of natural processes but also reflects the impact of human activities on the environment. High erosion rates can lead to soil degradation, loss of fertile land, and increased sedimentation in water bodies, which can have profound environmental and socio-economic implications. Understanding and managing these rates are essential for sustainable land use and water resource management."}, {"question": "How does the average rock density assumption affect the calculation of the total sediment yield in terms of volume?", "answer": "The assumption of an average rock density of 2,500 kg/m^3 is used to convert the total sediment yield from mass (in tons) to volume (in cubic meters). This conversion is necessary because the volume of sediment removed is a more intuitive measure of erosion than mass, as it directly relates to the physical removal of material from the Earth's surface. The choice of average rock density can affect the calculated volume, as different rocks have varying densities. However, the use of a standard average density allows for a consistent and comparable estimate of sediment yield across different regions and studies."}, {"question": "In the context of global hydrological processes, why is understanding sediment transport and yield important?", "answer": "Understanding sediment transport and yield is important because it provides insights into the Earth's surface processes, including erosion, weathering, and the impact of human activities on these processes.

{"paragraph": "2.2.8.1 Overview The atmospheric concentration of CO  (abbrevi- ated  as  [CO ])  before  the  industrial  age  was  about 250  ppmv.  The  present  concentration  is  about  400 ppmv, and figure 2.6 shows that global average tem- perature has increased by about 1°C since 1880 (Han- sen  et  al.  2010).  [CO ]  is  expected  to  reach  close  to 1,000 ppmv by the end of the century if stringent ef- forts  to  reduce  emissions  are  not  implemented,  and current climate models predict that this will increase global average temperature by 5 to 10°C. Figure 2.36 on  p.  86  shows  the  global  temperature  forecast  to 2030,  accounting  for  the  effects  of  solar  variability, ENSO,  volcanic  activity,  and  anthropogenic  causes (chiefly  GHG  emissions)  using  a  model  that  was highly successful in reproducing temperature changes from 1980 to 2010.

Much of  the  recent  warming  of  the  earth’s  surface  is  re- flected in a rise in ocean temperatures (Murphy et al. 2009; Johnson et al. 2010), which causes an increase in  evaporation.  Both  climate  models  and  observa- tions indicate that total atmospheric water vapor in- creases  by  about  7%/°C  due  to  warmer  air  being able to hold more water vapor (Wentz et al. 2007), as dictated by the Clausius–Clapeyron (C-C) relation (box 2.2). Because warmer oceans and land surfaces will increase evaporation rates, and a warmer atmo- sphere  can  hold  more  water  vapor,  it  is  widely  pre- dicted  that  increasing  temperature  will  cause  an increase in global precipitation rates and an intensifi- cation of the hydrologic cycle. Satellite observations over the last two decades generally confirm this pre- diction;  they  indicate  that  global  evaporation,  total atmospheric water (more than 99% of which is in va- por  form),  total  precipitation,  and  the  intensities  of the  heaviest  rainfall  events  have  increased  at  about the rate predicted by the C-C relation (Allen and In- gram 2002; Wentz et al. 2007; Min et al. 2011; Du- rack et al. 2012). Theory also suggests that, because Box 2.2 Water-Vapor Capacity of the Atmosphere The water-holding capacity of the air is given by the saturation vapor pressure, denoted e*. The value of e* depends on temperature, and its rate of change with tem- perature is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, which is derived from thermodynamic principles (see, e.g., Peixoto and Oort 1992).

As shown in figure 2.37, current climate models do reasonably well at forecasting global precipitation, but recent precipitation changes have not simply fol- lowed global temperature. This is because precipita- tion  changes  are  dominated  by  natural  solar  and volcanic  forcing,  which  varies  on  short  timescales, whereas  the  temperature  response  is  dominated  by steadily increasing anthropogenic GHG forcing. Thus, past and future global warming will be ac- companied  by  changes  in  the  timing,  amounts,  and distributions  of  precipitation,  evapotranspiration, snow,  soil  moisture,  streamflow,  and  other  factors; these  in  turn  will  force  major  adjustments  in  the magnitudes,  timing,  and  locations  of  floods, droughts,  water  demands,  supplies,  and  water  qual- ity.

This significant increase in temperature is due to the greenhouse effect of CO2, which traps heat in the atmosphere. The predicted temperature increase is alarming and suggests that the world will experience unprecedented climatic conditions, potentially leading to severe consequences for ecosystems and human societies."}, {"question": "Why does the water-holding capacity of the air increase with temperature, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation?", "answer": "The water-holding capacity of the air, denoted by the saturation vapor pressure (e*), increases approximately exponentially with temperature, as given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This relationship is derived from thermodynamic principles and indicates that warmer air can hold more water vapor. As a result, an increase in temperature leads to an increase in the water-holding capacity of the air, which in turn affects the global hydrologic cycle, including evaporation, precipitation, and atmospheric water vapor content."}, {"question": "In the context of the global hydrologic cycle, what changes can be expected in precipitation patterns due to increasing temperatures?", "answer": "Increasing temperatures will cause an increase in global precipitation rates and an intensification of the hydrologic cycle. This is because warmer oceans and land surfaces will increase evaporation rates, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor. As a result, more rainfall is concentrated in larger storms, while less rainfall occurs in smaller events, and dry periods and droughts will last longer.

These natural factors can cause significant variability in precipitation patterns over short periods, making it challenging to predict precipitation changes solely based on global temperature. As a result, past and future global warming will be accompanied by changes in the timing, amounts, and distributions of precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow, soil moisture, streamflow, and other factors, leading to complex and dynamic hydrologic responses."}, {"question": "In the context of climate change impacts on hydrology, what are the implications of increased evaporation and precipitation for water resources management?", "answer": "The increased evaporation and precipitation due to climate change will have significant implications for water resources management. Warmer temperatures will lead to increased evaporation from oceans and land surfaces, resulting in more intense precipitation events. This, in turn, will lead to more frequent and severe floods, as well as longer droughts. Effective water resources management will require adapting to these changes by implementing strategies to mitigate the impacts of floods and droughts, such as improving water storage infrastructure, enhancing water conservation practices, and developing early warning systems for extreme weather events."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to predict precipitation changes using climate models, and what factors contribute to this uncertainty?", "answer": "Predicting precipitation changes using climate models is challenging due to the complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors that influence precipitation patterns. Natural solar and volcanic forcing, as well as anthropogenic GHG emissions, contribute to the uncertainty in precipitation predictions. Additionally, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates temperature to water-holding capacity, introduces non-linearity in the system, making it difficult to accurately predict precipitation changes. Therefore, climate models must account for these factors and their interactions to provide reliable predictions of future precipitation patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of the hydrologic cycle, how do changes in temperature affect the distribution of precipitation, and what are the consequences for water resources?", "answer": "Changes in temperature affect the distribution of precipitation by altering the water-holding capacity of the air, leading to more intense precipitation events and longer dry periods. This, in turn, affects the distribution of water resources, including the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts. The consequences of these changes include increased risk of water scarcity, decreased water quality, and disrupted ecosystems, highlighting the need for adaptive water resources management strategies to mitigate these impacts."}, {"question": "What is the role of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in understanding the relationship between temperature and atmospheric water vapor content?", "answer": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between temperature and atmospheric water vapor content.

{"paragraph": "2.2.8.2 Evidence for Recent Climate-Related Hydrologic Changes Huntington (2006) reviewed recent evidence for the intensification of the global hydrologic cycle that is  predicted  to  accompany  global  warming;  his  re- sults are summarized below and in table 2.12. Addi- tional  reports  of  recent  climate-related  hydrologic changes are noted in box 2.3. Huntington (2006) reported evidence that global land  precipitation  increased  by  about  2%  over  the twentieth century, but with significant regional varia- tions:  Land  precipitation  increased  by  7  to  12%  be- tween 30 and 85°N and by 2% between 0 and 55°S, but with substantial decreases in some regions. In the United States, spring, summer, and fall precipitation increased during the twentieth century, but there was little change in Canada. Increases  in  snow-water  equivalent  averaging about  4  to  5%  per  decade  were  reported  in  North America and Russia. There was variability in the ex- tent  of  seasonal  snow  cover  in  fall  and  winter,  but there were widespread decreases in spring snow-cover extent across Russia, China, and the Swiss Alps, and the extent of spring snow cover decreased rapidly after 1980 in North America. The ratio of snow to total pre- cipitation decreased in March in New England in the United States and in Canada south of 55°N latitude. A  number  of  hydrologic  and  phenological  stud- ies cited by Huntington (2006) showed that the length of  the  growing  season  has  increased  substantially, suggesting  that  evapotranspiration  has  increased,  at least in humid regions. Evapotranspiration increases of  about  1  mm/yr  have  also  been  inferred  from  hy- drologic  budget  analyses  of  four  major  US  river  ba- sins from 1950 to 2000. Other studies found increases in lower troposphere water vapor (precipitable water content) in the last half of the twentieth century.

Part I: Introduction A Sampling of Reports of Recent Large-Scale Changes in the Hydrologic Cyclea Cloud Cover, Humidity, and Wind Speed (cid:129) Atmospheric water content (precipitable water) has increased globally since about 1988 (Wentz et al. 2007). (cid:129) Atmospheric water vapor has increased at a rate of 0.27 mm per decade from 1988 to 2006; the increase is largest in the tropics and Northern Hemisphere and relatively small in the Southern Hemisphere (Mears et al. 2010). (cid:129) Water vapor over the oceans increased by 2.4% from 1988–2006 (Wentz et al. 2007). (cid:129) Wind speeds over the global ocean have increased by 5 to 10% over the last 20 years (Young et al. 2011). (cid:129) Cloud cover increased over wide areas of the globe since 1900 (Henderson-Sellers 1992; Karl et al. 1993; Dai et al. 1997). Precipitation (cid:129) Global precipitation increased by 2.8% from 1988– 2006 (Wentz et al. 2007). (cid:129) Global land precipitation has increased by about 30 mm/yr since 1900 (Levinson et al. 2010). (cid:129) Precipitation in the Arctic has generally increased in the last century, especially in winter (Hinzman et al. 2005). (cid:129) The number of land-falling tropical cyclones in the United States has increased since 1994, and the num- ber of heavy rainfall events associated with those storms was more than double the long-term (1895– 2008) average (Kunkel et al. 2010). (cid:129) From 1970 to 2004 the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased globally; this increase is directly linked to increasing sea-surface temperatures (Hoyos et al. 2005). (cid:129) In the midlatitudes, there is a widespread increase in the frequency of very heavy precipitation during the past 50 to 100 years (Groisman et al. 2005). (cid:129) Precipitation increased in southern Canada by 13%, in northern Canada by 20%, and in the United States by 4% during the last 100 years; greatest increases were in eastern Canada and adjacent regions of the United States (Groisman and Easterling 1994). (cid:129) Decadal to multidecadal variability of global precipita- tion increased since 1900 (Tsonis 1996). (cid:129) Proportion of precipitation occurring in extreme one- day events increased in the United States in the last 30 to 80 years (Karl et al. 1995). (cid:129) Fall precipitation increased in central United States between 1948 and 1988 (Lettenmaier et al. 1994). (cid:129) The 2010 drought in the Amazon rain forest was unique in timing and intensity since record keeping began (1903). Since the mid-1970s, the length of the dry season and the number of “dry” and “very dry” events have increased (Marengo et al. 2011). (cid:129) Snowpack reductions in the northern US Rocky Moun- tains in the last 50 years are almost unprecedented compared to the previous 800 years, and are due to springtime warming caused by positive reinforcement of anthropogenic warming by decadal variability (Ped- erson et al. 2011). (cid:129) The average annual duration of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased by 15 to 18 days since the early 1970s (Dye 2002). (cid:129) A rapid reduction in arctic snow-cover duration (due primarily to an early disappearance of snow cover in spring) occurred in the 1980s and has continued (Dirk- sen et al. 2010). (cid:129) Snow-covered areas have declined in all latitude bands in the Northern Hemisphere since 1973 (Pielke et al. 2004). (cid:129) Spring snow-cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere declined steadily and decreased by about 8% from the 1970s to 2000s (Robinson 2010). (cid:129) Areal snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere declined 10% in the past 20 years (Groisman et al. 1994). (cid:129) Northern Hemisphere snow-cover extent decreased by 2.5 to 5% between 1978 and 1999 (Comiso and Parkin- son 2004). Evapotranspiration (cid:129) Pan evaporation in the United States and former Soviet Union has declined since 1950 (Peterson et al. 1995). Pan evaporation in China decreased by 5.4 mm/yr2 (cid:129) from 1960 to 1991 due to decreasing wind speed and insolation offsetting increased temperature, then increased by 7.9 mm/yr2 from 1992 to 2007 as the tem- perature effect became dominant (Liu et al. 2011). (cid:129) Global atmospheric evaporative demand has declined over the last 50 years, largely due to a 0.7 m/s decline in wind speed (McVicar et al. 2012). (cid:129) Global evaporation increased by 2.6% from 1988–2006 (Wentz et al. 2007). Streamflow (cid:129) Streamflow remained steady or increased over the last decade (2000–2009) in all continents and ocean catch- Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone ments, except Africa and the Mediterranean/Black Sea drainage, when compared to the long-term mean (Fekete et al. 2010). (cid:129) Annual streamflow increased by 15.5% over northern Canada from 1964–2007, consistent with other parts of the Arctic (Déry et al. 2009). (cid:129) Shrinking glaciers and snowpacks are reducing dis- charge in rivers that drain the central Rocky Mountain region (Wolfe et al. 2011). (cid:129) Mean annual discharge from the six largest rivers of the Eurasian Arctic increased about 12% from 1936 to 2009 (Shiklomanov 2010). (cid:129) Mean annual discharge from the four largest rivers of the North American Arctic increased about 10% from 1970 to 2009 (Shiklomanov 2010). (cid:129) Winter–spring streamflow strongly increased at over 50% of US gauging stations from 1948 to 1988, with strongest trends in north-central region (Lettenmaier et al. 1994). (cid:129) Streamflow has increased, especially in fall and winter, during past 50 years in most of conterminous United States (Lins and Michaels 1994). (cid:129) Runoff has increased in the United States between 1900 and 2008, and precipitation has accounted for almost all of the runoff variability during that period (McCabe and Wolock 2011). (cid:129) The number and size of lakes on permafrost areas in Siberia have decreased by 11% and 6% respectively between 1973 and 1998, almost certainly due to per- mafrost melting (Smith et al. 2005). (cid:129) Surface water of large lakes around the world warmed by 0.045 to 0.10°C/yr from 1985 to 2009, with far greater warming in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere than in low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere (Schneider and Hook 2010). Glaciers and Permafrost (cid:129) Most arctic glaciers experienced net loss of water since 1940, contributing 0.13 mm/yr to sea-level rise (Dowdeswell et al. 1998). to cloudiness, decreased over most land areas in the latter half of the twentieth century. Streamflow is a particularly meaningful indicator of climate change because (1) it areally and temporally integrates  precipitation  and  evapotranspiration  and (2)  it  amplifies  changes  in  precipitation:  Karl  and (cid:129) Permafrost warmed by up to 4°C in Alaska since 1976 (Osterkamp 2007). (cid:129) Over the last 18 years, the rate of loss of ice from the earth’s glaciers accelerated at the following rates: mountain glaciers and ice caps—12.6 Gt/yr2 (Rignot et al. 2011). (cid:129) The average balances for arctic glaciers have been gen- erally negative over the past 40 years (Hinzman et al. (cid:129) There was an abrupt, large increase in the extent of per- mafrost degradation in northern Alaska since 1982 associated with record warm temperatures during 1989–1998, mainly in massive ice wedges that had been stable for thousands of years (Jorgenson et al. 2006). (cid:129) The rate of mass loss from four glaciers in the Canadian arctic islands was 5 to 7 times faster in 2005–2009 than in 1963–2004 (Sharp et al. 2011). (cid:129) Permafrost temperatures increased 0.5 to 2°C during the last several decades in Alaska, northwest Canada, Siberia, and northern Europe (Romanovsky et al. 2010). (cid:129) Alpine glacier mass balances were generally negative for the eighteenth consecutive year. Decadal mean annual mass balance was –198 mm in the 1980s, –382 mm in the 1990s, and –624 mm for 2000–2008 (Pelto 2010). (cid:129) The portion of the Greenland ice sheet experiencing summer melting expanded by 17% from 1992 to 2002 (Comiso and Parkinson 2004). Growing Season and Plant Growth (cid:129) Plant growth in northern high latitudes increased from 1981 to 1991 (Myneni et al. 1997). (cid:129) Growing season has increased by 10 to 20 days in the last few decades, largely due to earlier beginning (Lin- derholm 2006). Riebsame  (1989)  concluded  that  a  given  relative change in precipitation is amplified to a one- to sixfold change  in  relative  streamflow  (see  discussion  in  sec- tion 2.2.8.3). However, streamflow is also directly af- fected by anthropogenic changes due to water imports and exports, reservoir construction, irrigation, etc. Part I: Introduction Sources cited by Huntington (2006) indicated an increase  in  continental  runoff  generally  during  the twentieth century, from individual major rivers glob- ally  and  from  many  smaller  rivers  in  the  Northern Hemisphere. This is consistent with the study of La- bat et al. (2004), who found a 4% increase in global runoff  for  each  1°C  temperature  increase  between 1875 and 1994 (figure 2.38). However, regional vari- ations  were  significant:  runoff  increased  in  North America, Asia, and South America; decreased in Af- rica; and showed no trend in Europe. In contrast, Pe- kárová et al. (2003) found no significant trends in the streamflows  of  large  rivers  from  all  continents  (ex- cept  Antarctica)  over  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth centuries,  but  identified  cycles  averaging  14  and  28 years,  and  a  20-  to  22-year  cycle  in  some  regions. These cycles may be related to teleconnections (sec- tion  2.1.6),  and  may  appear  to  be  trends  when shorter time periods are examined. An  important  question  is  to  what  extent  ob- served  and  forecast  temperature  changes  affect  the Figure 2.38 Mean annual runoff (in L/s) for five continents and linear trends for 1900–1970 and 1925–1994 intervals. Except for the African and European continents, mean annual runoff increases more rapidly during the second period, coincident with a rapid global warming [Labat et al. (2004). Evidence for global runoff increase related to climate warming. Advances in Water Resources 27:631–642, with permission of Elsevier]. frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  weather  events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Huntington (2006)  cited  several  regional  studies  that  report  in- creases in intense precipitation events, but found no definitive evidence of change in the intensity of trop- ical  storms.  However,  Kunkel  et  al.  (2010)  reported that  the  number  of  land-falling  tropical  cyclones  in the United States has increased since 1994, and the number  of  heavy  rainfall  events  associated  with those  storms  was  more  than  double  the  long-term (1895–2008)  average.  A  few  studies  found  an  in- crease in the frequency of extreme floods, but others did not detect trends in flooding in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, or central Europe. A global analysis by Dai et al. (2004) found that, since the 1970s, the fraction of land surface charac- terized  as  “very  dry”  more  than  doubled,  while “very  wet”  areas  declined  slightly;  another  study (Robock et al. 2000) found increases in areas of both severe  drought  and  moisture  surplus.  Huntington (2006)  reported  considerable  evidence  for  lengthen- Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone ing of the growing season throughout the Northern Hemisphere  which,  along  with  increasing  tempera- tures,  would  be  expected  to  be  associated  with  in- creased  evapotranspiration  and  decreased  growing- season  soil  moisture.  Robock  et  al.  (2000)  reported increases in summer soil moisture in recent decades at almost all sites having long-term records; they at- tributed  this  to  increases  in  precipitation  and  cloud cover  that  more  than  compensated  for  increased evapotranspiration.  Temperature  increases  over  the last  century  appear  to  have  increased  the  frequency of  ENSO  events,  and  these  regionally  variable changes  in  dryness  and  wetness  are  attributed  to both  ENSO-induced  decreases  in  precipitation  and warming-induced increases in evaporation. Huntington’s  (2006)  review  found  that  subpolar and mountain glaciers throughout the world are los- ing  mass  in  response  to  warming.  One  study  found that many such glaciers are experiencing higher win- ter  snowfall  that  is  more  than  compensated  by  in- creased  summer  ablation,  which  is  further  evidence for  a  recent  intensification  of  the  hydrologic  cycle. There  is  consistent  evidence  of  later  freeze-up  and earlier  break-up  in  rivers  and  lakes  in  the  Northern Hemisphere  from  1846  to  1995;  over  this  period freeze-up dates averaged 5.8 days per 100 years later, and  break-up  dates  averaged  6.5  days  per  100  years earlier.  A  few  longer  time  series  reveal  reduced  ice cover beginning as early as the sixteenth century, with increasing  rates  of  change  after  about  1850.  Earlier spring  snowmelt  runoff  was  reported  in  Siberia  and western United States and Canada, earlier river and lake ice-out in New England, and a longer frost-free season in the United States between 1948 and 1999. Huntington  (2006)  concluded  that  the  wide- spread increases in precipitation, evapotranspiration, water vapor, and runoff noted above suggest that the theoretically expected intensification of the water cy- cle  has  occurred  during  at  least  the  last  half  of  the twentieth century, and more recent studies (box 2.3) suggest that this trend is continuing. Observations of ocean salinity showing a 3% decrease in precipitation minus  evaporation  in  subtropical  oceans  (a  relative increase  in  evaporation)  and  7%  (Northern  Hemi- sphere) and 16% (Southern Hemisphere) increases in high-latitude oceans (a relative increase in precipita- tion) reinforce this conclusion (Helm et al. 2010).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of global hydrologic changes, what evidence suggests an intensification of the global hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The evidence includes a 2% increase in global land precipitation over the twentieth century, with significant regional variations, and increases in snow-water equivalent, water vapor, and runoff in various parts of the world."}, {"question": "How do changes in precipitation patterns affect streamflow, and why is streamflow a meaningful indicator of climate change?", "answer": "Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to changes in streamflow, as streamflow integrates precipitation and evapotranspiration over time and space. Streamflow is a meaningful indicator of climate change because it amplifies changes in precipitation, with a given relative change in precipitation resulting in a one- to sixfold change in relative streamflow. This amplification makes streamflow a sensitive indicator of climate-driven changes in the hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "In the context of evapotranspiration, what trends have been observed in pan evaporation and actual evapotranspiration, and what are the implications of these trends?", "answer": "Pan evaporation has declined in some regions, such as the United States and former Soviet Union, while actual evapotranspiration has increased in humid regions. The decline in pan evaporation is attributed to decreasing wind speed and insolation, while the increase in actual evapotranspiration is linked to rising temperatures and increasing precipitation. These trends have implications for water availability and ecosystem functioning, as changes in evapotranspiration can impact soil moisture, plant growth, and water yields."}, {"question": "Why do regional variations in hydrologic changes exist, and how do these variations impact our understanding of global hydrologic trends?", "answer": "Regional variations in hydrologic changes exist due to differences in climate, topography, and land use, which can lead to distinct patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff. These variations impact our understanding of global hydrologic trends by highlighting the importance of considering regional context and scale when interpreting hydrologic data. For example, while global precipitation may be increasing, regional decreases in precipitation can occur, leading to droughts and water scarcity in certain areas."}, {"question": "In the context of glaciers and permafrost, what changes have been observed, and what are the implications of these changes for sea-level rise and global hydrology?", "answer": "Glaciers and permafrost have been losing mass in response to warming, with many glaciers experiencing higher winter snowfall that is more than compensated by increased summer ablation. The loss of glacier mass contributes to sea-level rise, while the thawing of permafrost can lead to changes in soil moisture, groundwater flow, and ecosystem functioning. These changes have significant implications for global hydrology, as they can impact water availability, water quality, and the frequency of extreme events such as floods and droughts."}, {"question": "How do changes in the growing season and plant growth relate to hydrologic changes, and what are the implications of these changes for ecosystem functioning and water resources?", "answer": "Changes in the growing season and plant growth are linked to hydrologic changes, as increasing temperatures and precipitation can lead to longer growing seasons and increased plant growth. However, these changes can also lead to increased evapotranspiration, reduced soil moisture, and altered water yields, which can impact ecosystem functioning and water resources. For example, changes in plant growth patterns can affect the timing and magnitude of water demand, while changes in soil moisture can impact groundwater recharge and streamflow."}, {"question": "In the context of extreme weather events, what trends have been observed in the frequency and intensity of events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, and what are the implications of these trends for water resources and ecosystem resilience?", "answer": "Trends in extreme weather events are complex and varied, with some studies suggesting increases in the frequency and intensity of events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, while others find no definitive evidence of change. The implications of these trends are significant, as changes in extreme weather events can impact water resources, ecosystem resilience, and human well-being. For example, increases in heavy rainfall events can lead to flooding and water scarcity, while droughts can impact agricultural productivity and water availability."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to detect trends in hydrologic changes, and how can these challenges be addressed in the context of climate change research?", "answer": "Detecting trends in hydrologic changes is challenging due to the complexity and variability of the hydrologic cycle, as well as the influence of anthropogenic factors such as water management and land use. These challenges can be addressed by using long-term datasets, considering regional context and scale, and accounting for the impacts of anthropogenic factors on hydrologic trends. Additionally, the use of multiple lines of evidence, such as observations, modeling, and paleoclimate data, can help to improve our understanding of hydrologic changes and their relationship to climate change."}]}
{"paragraph": "2.2.8.3 Runoff Sensitivity to Climate Change Because  runoff  spatially  and  temporally  inte- grates  hydrologic  inputs  and  outputs,  and  because long-term average runoff represents the available wa- ter resource of a region (section 1.8.1), the sensitivity of  runoff  to  climate  change  is  a  critical  concern. Here  we  explore  this  question  using  simple  analyti- cal relations among long-term average water- and en- ergy-balance quantities (expressed as water fluxes [L To  make  the  notation  less  cumbersome  here we  use  simpler  symbols  to  represent  the  water-bal- ance components introduced in section 1.8: P ≡ μ ET ≡ μ , RO ≡ μ These relations begin with an expression relating evapotranspiration,  ET,  to  precipitation,  P,  and  po- tential evapotranspiration, PET, which expresses the evaporative demand of the climate (section 2.2.3): ET = f (P, PET). The function f  is a “Budyko-type equation,” named for  the  Russian  climatologist  M.  I.  Budyko,  who explored  such  relations  (Budyko  1958,  1974). Although  many  versions  of    have  been  proposed, Yang  et  al.  (2008)  used  physical,  dimensional,  and mathematical  reasoning  to  show  that  the  appropri- ate  form  of  a  simple  relation  between  ET  and  cli- = , > 0, where  w  is  a  parameter  that  depends  on  watershed characteristics.  Because  of  interrelations  among these characteristics, it is difficult to specify a physi- cally  based  relation  for  w.  However,  Yang  et  al. (2007) established empirical relations for nonhumid regions of China, indicating that w (1) increases with the ratio of soil hydraulic conductivity to rainfall rate and the ratio of soil-water storage capacity to poten- tial  evapotranspiration  and  (2)  decreases  with  aver- age watershed slope. Figure  2.39  shows  the  relation  between and  PET/P  as  given  by  equation  (2.10).  The  ratio PET/P is called the aridity index; actual evapotrans- piration is energy-limited in humid regions (PET/P Curves  with  low  values  of  w  characterize  regions with relatively small storage (e.g., rocky, steeply slop- ing watersheds where rainfall is quickly converted to runoff), while those with high w values represent rel- atively flat watersheds with high subsurface storage. From section 1.8, average precipitation, P, evapo- transpiration, ET, and runoff, RO, are related as RO = P − ET, Part I: Introduction where  we  assume  no  long-term  storage  changes  or ground-water  inputs.  Combining  (2.10)  and  (2.11) gives a relation between runoff and climate: = Í1 - ˙. We can now use equation (2.12) to explore how RO responds to climate changes, i.e., changes in PET and P. Taking derivatives of (2.12) yields Note that (2.13) and (2.14) assume that precipi- tation and potential evapotranspiration are indepen- dent. We have seen in section 2.2.3 and box 2.2 that both P and PET are positively related to temperature at the global scale, but the relations vary regionally, even in sign, so it is reasonable as a first approxima- tion to assume independence at the watershed scale. [See Yang et al. (2008) for further discussion.] Equations (2.13) and (2.14) are graphed in figure 2.40.  Figure  2.40a  shows  that,  in  humid  regions (PET/P < 1), most of a change in precipitation is re- water limit 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 tle  effect  due  to  watershed  characteristics.  In  arid regions  (PET/P  >  1),  the  effect  of  a  precipitation change  on  runoff  varies  strongly  with  watershed type,  being  small  in  watersheds  with  large  storage (large  w)  and  much  greater  where  storage  is  small. Figure 2.40b shows that watershed type has a much greater effect on ∂RO/∂PET in humid regions than in arid regions. The sensitivity of runoff to changes in climate is usually  expressed  as  elasticity,  defined  as the ratio of the relative change in runoff, dRO/RO, to the relative change in the climatic parameters. Thus the elasticity of runoff to precipitation, ε(RO,P), is O RO RO P P P P R O This expression is evaluated in box 2.4 on p. 94 and graphed in figure 2.41 on p. 95. Note that all val- ues of ε(RO,P) are greater than 1, indicating that a 1% increase in precipitation produces a greater than 1% increase in runoff. Elasticity increases with w and de- creases with increasing precipitation. As noted in box 2.4, it is more meaningful to re- lated fractional changes in runoff to absolute, rather than relative, increments of temperature, so that we express the temperature elasticity of runoff as e ∫ = . (2.16) Using an expression relating PET to temperature sion for this is derived in box 2.4 and plotted in figure 2.43 on p. 97. As expected, ε(RO,Ŧ) values are nega- tive; they are also much smaller than ε(RO,P) values. Figure 2.39 The relation between ET/ P and PET/P as given by equation (2.10). The ratio PET/P (horizontal axis) is the aridity index; The parameter w charac- terizes regional water storage [Yang et al. (2008).

Chapter 2 The Global Context: Climate, Hydrology, and the Critical Zone Some  example  calculations  of  elasticity/sensitivity using the above relations are given in box. 2.4. The climate elasticity of runoff has also been in- vestigated  using  more  elaborate  hydrologic  models and  empirically  by  examination  of  streamflow  and climatic  data.  The  conclusions  of  these  studies  are generally consistent with those determined via equa- tion (2.12). For example, Karl and Riebsame (1989) examined the sensitivity of streamflow in the United w = 10.0 Figure 2.40 (a) ∂RO/∂P as a function of aridity index, w = 10.0 ∂RO/∂PET as a function of inverse of aridity index [equation (2.14)]. States  to  changes  in  temperature  and  precipitation using  historical  data  and  concluded  that  1  to  2°C temperature  changes  typically  have  little  effect  on streamflow,  whereas  a  given  relative  change  in  pre- cipitation  produces  a  one-  to  sixfold  change  in streamflow. Sankarasubramanian et al. (2001) found empirical values of ε(RO,P) ranging from 1 to 3.5 in the United States, with highest values in semiarid re- gions,  and  Sankarasubramanian  and  Vogel  (2003) 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 Part I: Introduction Box 2.4 Derivation of Runoff Elasticity to Changes in Precipitation and Temperature Precipitation Elasticity From (2.12) and (2.13) we can write the elasticity of runoff to precipitation,  ε (RO,P) as e(RO,P) . Temperature Elasticity Given the strong dependence of potential evapo- transpiration on temperature, a number of formulas have been used for estimating monthly average poten- tial evapotranspiration from monthly average tempera- ture alone (see section 6.7.2.1). For estimating annual PET from average annual air temperature, Gardner (2009) used where PET is in mm/yr and Ŧ is mean annual air tempera- ture (K). Although this relationship is approximate, we use it to explore the essential aspects of hydrologic response to climate change. The change of runoff with temperature is found as ∂RO ∂RO ∂PET ∂T ∂PET ∂T From (2B4.2), 5.54×1013 exp(-4,620 ) 5.54×1013 exp(-4,620 ) Equation (2B4.5) could be used to calculate the elas- ticity of runoff to temperature, ε(RO,Ŧ), as However, because Ŧ is a large number, it is more mean- ingful to relate a fractional change in runoff to an actual temperature increment, dŦ, rather than to a relative change ∂Ŧ/Ŧ. This relation is found by multiplying (2B4.5) by dŦ and dividing by (2.12): 5.54×1013 ◊exp(-4,620 P ETˆ P E T where PET is given by (2B4.2). Example Calculations Here we use the above relationships to compare the changes in average runoff resulting from a 7% increase in average precipitation and a 1°C increase in average temperature in watersheds with w = 0.5 and w = 2 in two regions: Annual P  Annual T Region (mm) (°C) Humid temperate 1,000 10 Arid subtropical 200 20 Referring to the figures indicated, we find: Table 2B4.1 Humid Temperate Region. 0.5 2.41a 1.17 2.43a –0.010 2 2.41c 2.19 2.43c –0.069 Table 2B4.2 Arid Subtropical Region. 0.5 2.41a 1.32 2.43a –0.017 2 2.41c 2.98 2.43c –0.106 Multiplying the above values by the increases in P and T gives the following values of dRO/RO: Table 2B4.3 Humid Temperate Region. w Due to  d P /P  = 0.07 Due t o   d  = 1°C 0.5 0 .0 8 2 – 0 . 0 10 2 0.153 –0.069 Table 2B4.4 Arid Subtropical Region. w Due to dP/P = 0.07 Due to dŦ = 1°C 0.5 0.092 –0.017 2 0.209 –0.106 Thus the runoff responses are considerably larger (in absolute value) in the arid subtropical watersheds, and for a given climate, are considerably larger in watersheds with more storage.

Yang  and  Yang  (2011) found  ranging  from  1.6  to  3.9  and −0.11°C−1 ranging  from  to  in  two  large  Chi- nese  watersheds.  McCabe  and  Wolock  (2011)  re- ported that runoff has increased in the United States during the past century and that precipitation has ac- counted for almost all of the runoff variability, while temperature  effects  have  been  small,  even  though temperatures  have  increased  significantly.  Tang  and Lettenmaier (2012) found that ε(RO,P) ranges from 1 0.06°C−1 to  3  and  from  0.02  to  in  major global watersheds. The general conclusions from all of these studies ε(RO,P) > 1 everywhere and typically ranges from 1 to 3 or more; ε(RO,P) increases with mean annual evapotranspi- ration and temperature and decreases with mean annual precipitation; For a given climate, ε(RO,P) increases with water- shed storage (w); 4. In  humid  regions  (PET/P  <  1),  a  change  in  pre- cipitation (dP) mostly transforms into runoff (dRO 5. In arid regions (PET/P > 1), a change in precipi- tation (dP) mostly transforms into evapotranspira- tion (dRO < dET). Figure 2.42 Generalized relation of aver- age annual potential evapotranspiration as a function of mean annual temperature as postulated by Gardner (2009) [equation (2B4.2)]. 7. The  effects  of  global  warming-induced  precipita- tion  changes  on  runoff  will  be  greater  than  the effects  of  increased  evapotranspiration  due  to temperature increase. The  above  conclusions  appear  to  be  well founded theoretically and supported by observation. However, predicting the magnitude, and even the di- rection, of local and regional hydrologic change due to  climate  and  land-use  change  is  challenging  be- cause many factors are involved in addition to the di- rect  responses  to  changes  in  precipitation  and temperatures.  For  example,  experiments  indicate that higher CO  concentrations tend to reduce water use by plants (Lemon 1983), and this could offset in- creases in evapotranspiration from land surfaces due to  the  temperature  effect.  Thus,  one  plausible  sce- nario  is  that  evaporation  from  the  oceans  will  in- crease,  while  land  evapotranspiration  will  change little,  or  perhaps even  decrease. Further  uncertainty exists  because  of  the  difficulty  in  predicting  the  hy- drologic effects of changes in length of growing sea- son,  area  of  plant  cover,  plant  species,  wind  speed, and  cloudiness,  and  because  there  is  considerable feedback  between  land  evapotranspiration  and global  temperature  and  precipitation  (Shukla  and Mintz 1982; Loaiciga et al. 1996).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of runoff sensitivity to climate change, what is the significance of the aridity index (PET/P) in determining the response of runoff to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration?", "answer": "The aridity index (PET/P) is crucial as it determines whether a region is humid (PET/P < 1) or arid (PET/P > 1), influencing how changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration affect runoff. In humid regions, most of a change in precipitation translates into runoff, whereas in arid regions, the effect of a precipitation change on runoff varies strongly with watershed type. This index helps in understanding the sensitivity of runoff to climate changes, which is essential for predicting hydrologic responses to global warming."}, {"question": "How does the parameter w, which characterizes regional water storage, influence the relationship between evapotranspiration (ET) and the aridity index (PET/P)?", "answer": "The parameter w affects the curve that relates ET/P to PET/P, with higher w values indicating regions with more water storage capacity, such as flat watersheds, and lower w values representing regions with less storage, like rocky or steeply sloping watersheds. This parameter is critical because it influences the shape of the Budyko-type equation, thereby affecting how evapotranspiration responds to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration."}, {"question": "Why is the elasticity of runoff to precipitation (ε(RO,P)) greater than 1, and what implications does this have for hydrologic responses to climate change?", "answer": "The elasticity of runoff to precipitation (ε(RO,P)) is greater than 1 because a 1% increase in precipitation produces a greater than 1% increase in runoff. This implies that even small changes in precipitation can lead to significant changes in runoff, which has important implications for predicting and managing water resources under climate change scenarios. Furthermore, ε(RO,P) increases with w and decreases with increasing precipitation, indicating that the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation changes is higher in regions with more water storage and lower precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of climate change, how do changes in temperature affect runoff, and why are the effects of temperature changes on runoff generally smaller than those of precipitation changes?", "answer": "Changes in temperature affect runoff primarily through their impact on potential evapotranspiration (PET). However, the effects of temperature changes on runoff are generally smaller than those of precipitation changes because the relationship between PET and temperature, although positive, does not directly translate into significant changes in runoff. This is partly because other factors, such as changes in precipitation, watershed characteristics, and even the direct effects of CO2 on plant water use, can offset the increases in evapotranspiration due to temperature rise."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in predicting the magnitude and direction of local and regional hydrologic change due to climate and land-use change, and how do these challenges impact the understanding of runoff sensitivity to climate change?", "answer": "Predicting the magnitude and direction of local and regional hydrologic change is challenging due to the involvement of many factors beyond direct responses to precipitation and temperature changes, including CO2 effects on plant water use, changes in length of growing season, area of plant cover, plant species, wind speed, and cloudiness. These factors introduce uncertainty and complexity, making it difficult to accurately predict how runoff will respond to climate change. Additionally, feedback between land evapotranspiration and global temperature and precipitation patterns further complicates these predictions, highlighting the need for comprehensive models that account for these interactions."}, {"question": "In the context of runoff sensitivity to climate change, why is it more meaningful to relate fractional changes in runoff to absolute increments of temperature rather than relative changes?", "answer": "It is more meaningful to relate fractional changes in runoff to absolute increments of temperature because temperature is typically measured on an absolute scale (e.g., degrees Celsius), and changes in temperature are usually discussed in terms of absolute increments (e.g., a 1°C increase). Relating runoff changes to absolute temperature increments provides a more direct and intuitive understanding of how temperature changes impact runoff, especially when considering the effects of global warming."}, {"question": "How does the type of watershed (e.g., humid vs. arid, high storage vs. low storage) influence the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and what are the implications for water resource management?", "answer": "The type of watershed significantly influences the sensitivity of runoff to climate changes. In humid regions, changes in precipitation largely translate into changes in runoff, whereas in arid regions, the response of runoff to precipitation changes depends on the watershed's storage capacity. Watersheds with high storage capacity tend to have a smaller response of runoff to precipitation changes compared to those with low storage. Understanding these differences is crucial for water resource management, as it allows for more accurate predictions of runoff responses to climate change and informs strategies for managing water resources effectively under different climatic conditions."}]}

The local evapo- ratio,  (x,y),  was  similarly transpiration-recycling defined as ET ET ET where ET (x,y)  is  terrestrial  evapotranspiration  that returns  as  continental  precipitation,  and  (x,y)  is terrestrial evapotranspiration that precipitates on an ocean.  Thus  (x,y)  indicates  the  importance  of evaporation at a certain location in sustaining down- wind  precipitation.  Globally,  the  long-term  average equals the average P . Applying water-balance concepts (section 1.8) to the atmosphere, van der Ent et al. (2010) determined the  global  distribution  of  (x,y)  (figure  2.44)  and (x,y) (figure 2.45). Oceanic sources are dominant in North America, though in the West about 60% of the evaporation returns to the continent downwind. Figure 2.44 Average continental precipitation recycling ratio (1999–2008) [van der Ent et al. (2010). Origin and fate of atmospheric moisture over continents. Water Resources Research 46, with permission of the American Geophysical Union]. South  America  shows  three  distinct  moisture-recy- cling patterns: Evapotranspiration from the Guianas and the Amazon region becomes precipitation to the south in the Río de la Plata basin; there is local recy- cling east of the Andes; and there is very little mois- ture recycling in Patagonia. East Africa gets most of its  precipitation  from  the  Indian  Ocean  and,  along with central Africa, contributes moisture to West Af- rica, which gets much of its precipitation from conti- nental sources. Between Europe and Asia, the main moisture flux is westerly, as reflected in the eastward increase  of  (x,y);  40  to  70%  of  the  evaporation from Europe returns to a continental area. Much of the  precipitation  in  western  and  northern  China, Mongolia, and Siberia is of continental origin. Local moisture  recycling  [high  values  of  both  (x,y)  and (x,y)]  is  very  important  in  the  Tibetan  plateau. Although  most  precipitation  in  the  south  of  India, Southeast Asia, and Oceania is of oceanic origin, val- ues of R  near 30% indicate that continental precipi- tation  is  important  there.  In  the  northern  part  of Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, which are very wet areas, R (x,y) is about 40%.

As  noted  by  van der  Ent  et  al.  (2010),  recycled  moisture  multiplies precipitation by a factor 1.67 globally, and by much more in some regions: M (x,y) =  3 in  the  Río de la Plata basin in South America and is as high as 10 in western China. Clearly, the feedbacks of moisture recycling play an  important  role  in  the  global  climate.  Thus  large- scale land-use changes currently taking place could in- teract  with  changes  due  to  global  warming,  perhaps reinforcing them in some areas and weakening them in  others.  Clearly  there  is  much  to  learn  about  the global  hydrologic  cycle  and  its  complex  feedbacks with human activities, and there are many potentially fruitful avenues of study.

Because of humanity’s sheer numbers and its increasing capacity to affect large regions, the hydro- logic cycle is being altered on a global scale with consequences for the human life support system that are often counterintuitive. There is a growing need to assess comprehensively our agricultural, urban, and industrial activities, and to generate a body of knowledge on which to base plans for the future. It seems safe to say that these actions must come ulti- mately from global-scale numerical models of the interactive physical, chemical, and biological sys- tems of the earth.

This ratio is crucial for understanding the feedbacks of moisture recycling in the global climate.

{"paragraph": "2.3 Hydrology and the Critical Zone The Critical Zone (CZ) is “the heterogeneous, near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock, soil, water, air and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine availability of life sustaining resources” (US National Research Council 2001). The CZ extends from the top of the vegetation to the bottom of the aquifer (figure 2.46) and includes the  near-surface  biosphere  and  atmosphere,  the  pe- dosphere (the region in which soil-forming processes operate),  and  the  surface  and  near-surface  portions of  the  hydrosphere  and  lithosphere.  Water  move- ment is the principal agent in transporting mass and energy  through  the  CZ.  Because  of  the  importance of these exchange processes to natural processes and to human life, there is increasing interest in focusing on  the  CZ  as  an  integrating,  although  heteroge- neous,  framework  for  scientific  study  (Wilding  and Lin 2006; Lin 2010).

Climate influences hydrology by determining precipitation patterns, which in turn affect water movement and storage in the CZ. Soils (pedosphere) and vegetation (biosphere) also play critical roles in hydrology, as they influence infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration. Understanding these relationships is essential for comprehending water movement and storage in the CZ, as they impact the availability of water resources and the health of ecosystems. This understanding can inform management practices and policies aimed at conserving water resources and maintaining ecosystem balance."}, {"question": "In the context of the Critical Zone, what is the significance of the pedosphere and the biosphere in relation to hydrology and water resources science?", "answer": "The pedosphere (soils) and the biosphere (vegetation) are significant in the Critical Zone because they are crucial for water movement and storage.

This role has significant implications for hydrology and water resources science, as it underscores the importance of understanding water flow pathways, rates, and quantities in the CZ. By recognizing water's central role, scientists and managers can better assess water resource availability, predict the impacts of climate change, and develop strategies for sustainable water management."}, {"question": "How does the concept of the Critical Zone as an integrating framework for scientific study contribute to our understanding of hydrological processes and water resources management?", "answer": "The concept of the Critical Zone as an integrating framework for scientific study contributes significantly to our understanding of hydrological processes by highlighting the interconnectedness of the CZ's components. This framework encourages a holistic approach to studying hydrology, considering the interactions among rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms.

Note that hydrologically sig- nificant seasonal freezing of soil occurs in many win- ters  over  much  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere  land areas above 40° latitude (figure 2.47). Alfisols  are  naturally  fertile  soils  that  occur  in large  regions  to  the  north  of  the  Mollisols  in  the Northern Hemisphere, as well as in several regions between about 35°N and S. These areas have sub- humid  to  humid  climates,  and  typically  support grassland, savanna, or hardwood forests. form  on  recent  volcanic  deposits  on Andisols which  soil  horizons  are  not  highly  developed. They are generally highly permeable. Aridisols  occur  in  desert  regions,  which  are  con- centrated  near  30°  latitude.  However,  in  South America the zone of Aridisols extends southward from 30° in the rain shadow of the Andes, and in Asia these soils are found near 40° in the shadow of the Himalayas. Gelisols occur where permafrost is present within 2 m of the surface. Figure 2.47 delineates areas in which  this  condition  is  spatially  continuous  and those in which it is discontinuous; in the latter ar- eas,  permafrost  is  typically  present  under  north- facing slopes and absent under south-facing slopes. Permafrost  depths  range  from  60  to  90  m  at  the southern  edge  of  the  continuous-permafrost  zone up to 1,000 m in northern Alaska and arctic Can- ada (Brown and Péwé 1973; Zhang et al. 2000). Histosols are concentrated where more than 80% of the growing season (defined as months with av- erage temperature > 10°C) has > 40 mm of precip- itation  (Lottes  and  Ziegler  1994).  The  largest zones of Histosols are north of latitude 50°N (Can- ada, British Isles). Mollisols,  which  include  some  of  the  naturally most  productive,  and  hence  most  widely  culti- vated,  soils,  occur  in  climates  ranging  from  tem- perate  to  cool  and  semiarid  to  humid.  They  are Part I: Introduction concentrated  in  the  grassland  belts  north  of  the Aridisol  belts  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere,  and are also found near 30°S in central South America. Oxisols are excessively weathered soils confined to the  tropical  and  subtropical  rain  forests  on  either side  of  the  equator,  where  intense  leaching  has been occurring for long periods of geologic history. Spodosols  develop  in  well-drained  sites  in  cool, wet climates under hardwood and conifer forests. They  are  widespread  in  the  northeastern  United States and southeastern Canada and in a large belt north  of  60°  latitude  in  Scandinavia  and  the  for- mer Soviet Union. Ultisols  are  largely  confined  to  within  20°  of  the equator, where climates are humid and subtropical or tropical and soil-forming processes are intense. There  are  also  large  areas  of  these  soils  in  south- eastern United States and southeastern China. Vertisols  form  where  geologic  material  weathers to  clay  minerals  that  swell  when  wet  and  shrink when  dry,  and  their  distribution  is  determined  in part by the nature of the parent material. However, these soils are most commonly associated with cli- mates that experience a pronounced alternation of wet and dry seasons.

These properties affect the extent of the transpiring surface, the degree to which rain and snow are intercepted and retained, and the efficacy of air turbulence in the exchange of water vapor and heat between the land and the atmosphere.

This is due to the large surface area of leaves and the high rate of water uptake and evaporation through transpiration. As a result, plants are the primary drivers of water and energy exchange between the land and the atmosphere."}, {"question": "In the context of plant structure, what is the role of leaf shading in hydrologic response?", "answer": "The fraction of ground shaded by leaves, which is a function of plant type and spacing, determines the extent of the transpiring surface and the degree to which rain and snow are intercepted and retained to promptly evaporate. This means that leaf shading affects the amount of water available for transpiration and the rate of evaporation from the land surface."}, {"question": "How does the height of plants influence the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The height of plants, which is a function of plant type, determines the roughness of the surface, and hence the efficacy of air turbulence in the exchange of water vapor and heat between the land and the atmosphere.

This means that plant root systems play a crucial role in determining the amount of water that enters the soil and becomes available for transpiration or runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of water conductance, why is it species-dependent?", "answer": "Water conductance of leaves is species-dependent because different plant species have varying levels of water conductance, which affects the rate of transpiration. This means that the rate of water uptake and evaporation through transpiration varies between different plant species, influencing the overall hydrologic response."}, {"question": "How does the depth of root systems affect the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The depth of root systems, which is a determinant of the size of the soil-storage reservoir from which water is available for transpiration, affects the amount of water available for plants to transpire. Deeper root systems allow plants to access more water, while shallower root systems limit the amount of water available for transpiration."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic response, what are the implications of plant properties on the water and energy balances of the land surface?", "answer": "The implications of plant properties on the water and energy balances of the land surface are significant, as they affect the extent of the transpiring surface, the degree to which rain and snow are intercepted and retained, and the efficacy of air turbulence in the exchange of water vapor and heat between the land and the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the overall hydrologic response, including the rate of transpiration, runoff, and infiltration. Understanding these implications is crucial for predicting and managing hydrologic processes, particularly in the context of climate change and land use modifications."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the areal extent of plant root systems in hydrologic modeling?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the areal extent of plant root systems in hydrologic modeling because they have a major effect on surface porosity and the propensity for rain and snowmelt to infiltrate. This means that neglecting the areal extent of plant root systems can lead to inaccurate predictions of infiltration and runoff, which can have significant implications for water resource management and flood risk assessment."}, {"question": "In the context of plant transpiration, how does the rate of water uptake and evaporation affect the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The rate of water uptake and evaporation through transpiration affects the hydrologic cycle by influencing the amount of water available for runoff and infiltration. High rates of transpiration can reduce the amount of water available for runoff, while low rates of transpiration can increase the amount of water available for infiltration."}]}

Al- though there are many schemes for defining biomes, it is widely recognized that the distribution of major plant  communities  is  controlled  by  climate.  Whit- taker  (1975)  identified  six  major  structural  types  of land vegetation, which are based on the characteris- tics  that  most  directly  affect  hydrologic  response: plant height, leaf type, and plant spacing: 1. Forest—dominated by tall trees, generally closely 2. Woodland—dominated  by  small  trees,  generally widely  spaced  and  with  well-developed  under- 3. Shrubland—dominated  by  shrubs,  with  total plant coverage exceeding 50% of the land area; 4. Grassland—two  main  types:  tropical  (savannas) or temperate; 5. Scrubland—dominated by shrubs, with plant cov- erage between 10 and 50%; and 6. Desert—with plant coverage below 10%. In Whittaker’s (1975) scheme, the occurrence of these structural types in various climatic zones pro- duces 21 major terrestrial biomes (table 2.15) that are simply  related  to  mean  annual  temperature  and mean  annual  precipitation  (figure  2.48).  Note  that vertical  biome  boundaries  closely  parallel  lines  of equal aridity index. The global distribution of Whit- taker’s biomes is shown in figure 2.49 on p. 106.

{"paragraph": "3.0 Introduction Exchanges of water and energy between the sur- face and the atmosphere are central processes of the hydrologic  cycle.  Water  is  exchanged  via  precipita- tion  and  evaporation;  energy  exchanges  occur  via three modes: (1) electromagnetic radiation, (2) sensi- heat  (heat  flows  driven  by  temperature  gradi- ents), and (3) latent heat (heat flows accompanying vapor-liquid phase changes). The  laws  of  radiant-energy  exchange  and  the composition  and  structure  of  the  atmosphere  were introduced in section 2.1.

Understanding these laws and atmospheric characteristics is essential for comprehending how precipitation, evaporation, and heat exchanges occur. This knowledge is vital for predicting and managing water resources and understanding the impacts of environmental changes on the hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "How does latent heat contribute to the energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere?", "answer": "Latent heat contributes to the energy exchange by accompanying vapor-liquid phase changes, such as during evaporation or condensation. This process involves the absorption or release of heat energy, which is a critical component of the energy balance in the hydrologic cycle. The exchange of latent heat is particularly significant because it influences the formation of precipitation and the overall energy budget of the Earth's surface."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation formation, what physical processes are involved?", "answer": "The basic physics of precipitation formation involves the interaction of atmospheric conditions, including the presence of water vapor, temperature gradients, and other factors that lead to the condensation of water vapor into droplets.

The gas constants are related as R M 18.0 = = = 0.622, where    is  the  molecular  weight  of  water  and is the effective molecular weight of dry air. By virtue of their molecular motion and collisions, each  constituent  of  a  mixture  of  gases  exerts  a  pres- sure, called a partial pressure, which is proportional to its concentration. The sum of the partial pressures of the  gases  in  the  atmosphere  equals  the  total  atmo- spheric pressure. The partial pressure of water vapor is called the vapor pressure, and is designated e [F L–2]. Treating  air  (subscript  a)  as  a  mixture  of  dry  air  and water vapor, Dalton’s law gives the total pressure p as the sum of the partial pressures of the constituents: p = p  + e. r = 1 - 0.378 . Thus we see that moist air  is less dense  than  dry air. However,  the  typical  surface  air  pressure  is  p  ≈ Pa  while  vapor  pressures  seldom  exceed  Pa, so the effect of water vapor on density can generally be neglected. 1.39 1.36 1.34 1.31 1.29 Because air has a low heat conductivity, a “par- cel” of air that moves vertically does not immediately exchange  heat  with  surrounding  air  and  initially  re- tains  its  original  temperature;  this  is  called  an batic process. However, the parcel becomes subject to the pressure of its new position: If it moves to a higher elevation, its pressure decreases and therefore its den- sity and temperature also decrease to satisfy equation (3.7); this temperature decrease without loss of heat is cooling.  If  it  moves  to  a  lower  elevation, adiabatic the  converse  happens  and  there  is adiabatic  warm- ing. Under these conditions, it can be shown from the first  law  of  thermodynamics,  the  ideal  gas  law,  and the  hydrostatic  equation  that  the  rate  of  change  of temperature with elevation for dry air, Γ G ∫ - = , where    is  the  heat  capacity  of  dry  air  at  constant pressure.    is  called  the  rate; dry  adiabatic  lapse = 9.75×10–3 = 1,005 J/kg · K, so Γ the value of c K/m  =  9.75  K/km.  Note  that  the  lapse  rate  is defined as the negative of the vertical rate of change of temperature. As shown in figure 2.2, the average near-surface rate of decrease of temperature with altitude is about km, somewhat less steep than Γ", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of atmospheric pressure, how does the weight of the overlying atmosphere influence pressure at any given altitude?", "answer": "The weight of the overlying atmosphere determines the pressure at any altitude, with the rate of change of pressure with altitude given by the hydrostatic relation, which involves mass density and gravitational acceleration. This relationship is fundamental in understanding how atmospheric pressure varies with height. The hydrostatic relation essentially states that the pressure decrease with altitude is directly related to the density of the air and the gravitational force acting on it."}, {"question": "Why does moist air tend to be less dense than dry air, and under what conditions can the effect of water vapor on density be neglected?", "answer": "Moist air is less dense than dry air because the molecular weight of water vapor is less than that of dry air, leading to a lower density when water vapor is present. However, the effect of water vapor on density can generally be neglected at typical surface air pressures (approximately 1013 mbar) because vapor pressures are usually much lower (seldom exceeding 0.02 bar), making the contribution of water vapor to the overall density minimal."}, {"question": "In the context of air parcels moving vertically, what is an adiabatic process, and how does it affect the temperature of the air parcel?", "answer": "An adiabatic process refers to the movement of an air parcel vertically without immediate heat exchange with surrounding air, retaining its original temperature initially. As the parcel moves to a higher elevation, its pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in density and temperature to satisfy the ideal gas law; this cooling process is known as adiabatic cooling. Conversely, moving to a lower elevation results in adiabatic warming. This process is crucial in understanding temperature changes in the atmosphere with altitude."}, {"question": "How does the ideal gas law relate the pressure, absolute temperature, and density of a gas, and what are the implications for dry air and water vapor?", "answer": "The ideal gas law relates the pressure (p), absolute temperature (T), and density (ρ) of a gas through the equation p = ρRT, where R is the gas constant. For dry air, this relationship allows for the calculation of density at normal sea-level pressure and absolute temperature. For water vapor, the ideal gas law similarly relates vapor pressure, temperature, and density, with the gas constant for water vapor being different from that of dry air. Understanding these relationships is essential for calculating and predicting atmospheric conditions and processes."}, {"question": "In the context of atmospheric lapse rate, why is the dry adiabatic lapse rate an important concept, and what is its value?", "answer": "The dry adiabatic lapse rate (Γ) is an important concept because it describes the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude in the atmosphere under adiabatic conditions. The value of Γ is approximately 9.75 K/km, which means that for every kilometer of ascent, the temperature decreases by about 9.75 degrees Celsius. This lapse rate is a critical factor in understanding atmospheric temperature profiles and is defined as the negative of the vertical rate of change of temperature."}, {"question": "How does Dalton’s law of partial pressures apply to the mixture of dry air and water vapor in the atmosphere, and what is the significance of the vapor pressure?", "answer": "Dalton’s law states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. For the atmosphere, this means that the total atmospheric pressure is the sum of the partial pressure of dry air and the partial pressure of water vapor (vapor pressure). The vapor pressure is significant because it represents the contribution of water vapor to the total atmospheric pressure and is a critical component in understanding humidity and atmospheric moisture processes."}, {"question": "Why is the heat conductivity of air important in the context of vertical air parcel movement, and what are the implications for adiabatic processes?", "answer": "The low heat conductivity of air is important because it allows an air parcel moving vertically to retain its original temperature initially, without immediately exchanging heat with surrounding air. This characteristic enables adiabatic processes to occur, where the temperature of the air parcel changes solely due to the change in pressure as it moves to different altitudes, leading to adiabatic cooling or warming. The implications of this are significant for understanding atmospheric temperature changes and the behavior of air parcels in the atmosphere."}, {"question": "In the context of atmospheric science, how does the molecular weight of gases influence their behavior and properties, such as density and partial pressure?", "answer": "The molecular weight of gases significantly influences their behavior and properties. For instance, the molecular weight of water vapor is less than that of dry air, which affects the density of moist air compared to dry air.

This process indicates that the cooling effect of ascending is counteracted by the warming effect of condensation, leading to a less significant temperature drop than would occur in dry air.

This means that as long as the vapor does not condense, the parcel behaves similarly to dry air in terms of cooling or warming rates.

In figure 3.2, initially dry air with a temperature of T  lies above a horizontal water surface with a tem- perature  of  .  The  molecules  at  the  surface  are  at- tracted to those in the body of the liquid by hydrogen bonds,  but  some  of  the  surface  molecules  have  suffi- cient energy to sever the bonds and enter the thin layer of air just above the surface. The number of molecules with  this  “escape  energy”  increases  as    increases. The water molecules entering the surface layer move in random motion, and as these molecules accumulate in the layer, some will re-enter the liquid. The rate at which  they  re-enter  is  proportional  to  the  concentra- tion of molecules in the layer. An equilibrium is soon reached, at which the rates of escape and re-entry are equal and the vapor pressure in the layer immediately above the surface is equal to the saturation vapor pres- *, at the temperature of the surface, T . The re- lation between e * and T  is given by equation (3.9a). Molecules moving into the air above the surface layer are subject to dispersion away from the surface by turbulent eddies. Under given wind and tempera- ture  conditions  their  concentration  at  a  reference level reaches a steady-state vapor pressure, e . The rate of evaporation E is the net rate at which molecules move from the saturated surface layer into the air above, and that rate is proportional to the difference between the vapor pressure of the surface layer and the vapor pressure of the overlying air: Figure 3.2 Schematic diagram of flux of water molecules over a water surface. The vapor pres- sure at the surface is equal to the saturation vapor pressure, e T ; the vapor pressure of the overlying air is e . The evaporation rate is proportional to (e > e *, condensation occurs. The proportionality factor depends on the refer- ence height and on the factors controlling the diffu- sion  of  water  vapor  in  the  air,  principally  the  wind velocity and the nature of the surface, as described in detail in section 3.5. Equation (3.16) is the basis for the mass-transfer approach for estimating evapotranspi- ration (sections 3.5.3.4 and 6.3.2). Equation (3.16) is straightforward, but note that Depending on the temperature of the surface and the temperature and humidity of the air, the difference between the two vapor pressures can be positive, zero, or negative, and 1. if e * > e , evaporation is occurring; 2. if e * < e , water is condensing on the surface; 3. if e * = e , neither condensation or evapora- tion is occurring. Note also that the value of e  can be less than or equal to the saturation vapor pressure at the air tem- perature, e * (i.e., relative humidity can be less than or equal to 100%), and Evaporation will occur even if the relative humidity equals 100%, as long as e * > e .

For  most  situations  of  hydrologic  interest,  the evaporating  surface  is  essentially  horizontal,  so  that the number of water molecules just below the surface is the same as in the surface. However, in tiny spheri- cal cloud droplets, there are more molecules in the sur- face than in the next layer below. Because of this, the intermolecular  hydrogen-bond  forces  acting  on  the surface molecules are weaker than for a horizontal sur- face. Thus the vapor pressure at the surface of a very small  droplet  is  higher  than  given  by  equation  (3.9a) for a horizontal surface, and there is a correspondingly greater tendency for the molecules to evaporate. Evaporation  occurs  in  exactly  the  same  way whether the underlying surface is liquid water or ice (snow).  The  only  difference  between  the  two  situa- tions  is  that  the  saturation  vapor  pressure  for  an  ice surface at a given temperature is slightly lower [equa- tion (3.9b)]  (figure  3.3).

This relationship is fundamental in understanding the process of evaporation, as it indicates that evaporation occurs when the vapor pressure at the surface is greater than that in the air above. The proportionality factor in this relationship depends on several factors, including the reference height, wind velocity, and the nature of the surface, which are crucial in determining the rate at which water molecules move from the saturated surface layer into the air."}, {"question": "Why does the vapor pressure at the surface of a very small droplet differ from that given by equation (3.9a) for a horizontal surface?", "answer": "The vapor pressure at the surface of a very small droplet is higher than that given by equation (3.9a) for a horizontal surface because the intermolecular hydrogen-bond forces acting on the surface molecules are weaker due to the spherical shape of the droplet. This results in a greater tendency for the molecules to evaporate from the surface of small droplets compared to a horizontal surface.

If the vapor pressure at the surface is greater than that in the air, evaporation occurs. If the vapor pressure at the surface is less than that in the air, condensation occurs. If the two vapor pressures are equal, neither evaporation nor condensation occurs. This relationship highlights the complex interplay between surface temperature, air temperature, and humidity in determining the direction of vapor exchange."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic interest, what is the typical orientation of the evaporating surface, and how does this affect the number of water molecules just below the surface?", "answer": "For most situations of hydrologic interest, the evaporating surface is essentially horizontal, resulting in the number of water molecules just below the surface being the same as in the surface. This horizontal orientation is a key assumption in many hydrologic models and is crucial for understanding evaporation processes in various environments."}, {"question": "Why does evaporation occur even when the relative humidity equals 100%, as long as the vapor pressure at the surface is greater than that in the air?", "answer": "Evaporation occurs even when the relative humidity equals 100% because the rate of evaporation is determined by the difference between the vapor pressure at the surface and that in the air, not by the relative humidity itself. As long as the vapor pressure at the surface is greater than that in the air, there will be a net movement of water molecules from the surface into the air, resulting in evaporation. This highlights the importance of considering the actual vapor pressures rather than just the relative humidity when assessing evaporation processes."}, {"question": "How does the process of evaporation from an ice surface differ from that of a liquid water surface?", "answer": "The process of evaporation from an ice surface is essentially the same as that from a liquid water surface, with the only difference being that the saturation vapor pressure for an ice surface at a given temperature is slightly lower than that for a liquid water surface. This difference has significant implications for the formation of precipitation, as it affects the rate of evaporation and condensation processes in the atmosphere."}, {"question": "In the context of cloud formation, why is the vapor pressure at the surface of small droplets important?", "answer": "The vapor pressure at the surface of small droplets is important because it affects the rate of evaporation and condensation, which in turn influences the formation of clouds and precipitation. The higher vapor pressure at the surface of small droplets results in a greater tendency for molecules to evaporate, which can impact the growth and development of clouds. Understanding the vapor pressure at the surface of small droplets is crucial for predicting cloud formation and precipitation patterns."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.3.2 Latent Heat The latent heat of vaporization, λ , is the quan- tity of heat energy that must be absorbed to break the hydrogen  bonds  when  evaporation  takes  place;  this same  quantity  is  released  when  the  bonds  are  re- formed upon condensation. Thus Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange )aPk( ecnereffid erusserp-ropav eci–retaW Temperature (°C) • Evaporation  is  always  accompanied  by  a  transfer of heat out of the evaporating surface; i.e., the sur- face cools. • Condensation in the atmosphere is always accom- panied by a transfer of heat into the air; i.e., the air • Condensation  on  the  surface  is  always  accompa- nied by transfer of heat to the surface; i.e., the sur- face warms.

When the underlying surface is liquid water, λE = λ  · ρ where  is  the  rate  of  latent-heat  transfer  per  unit area per unit time [E L–2 T–1], E is the rate of evapo- ration  or  condensation  [L    is  the  density  of water [M L–3], and λ is the latent heat of vaporiza- tion [E M–1].

This involves the latent heat of fusion (λf) in addition to the latent heat of vaporization (λ), with the total latent heat of sublimation being λ + λf = 0.334 MJ/kg. The inclusion of λf accounts for the energy needed to change the state of water from solid to gas without going through the liquid phase, which is a critical aspect of hydrological processes in cold regions."}, {"question": "Why is the latent heat of fusion not a function of temperature?", "answer": "The latent heat of fusion (λf) is not a function of temperature because melting takes place at 0°C at atmospheric pressure, meaning that the energy required to disrupt the molecular structure of ice is constant and does not vary with temperature.

{"paragraph": "3.4.2 Condensation When  air  above  the  freezing  point  is  cooled  to the  dew  point,  liquid  water  is  thermodynamically stable and randomly colliding water-vapor molecules tend to form tiny droplets. However, as described in section  3.3.1,  a  small  spherical  droplet  has  a  high tendency to evaporate because the ratio of the num- ber  of  molecules  in  the  surface  layer  to  the  number just  below the surface  is high,  producing a high va- por pressure. As the droplet diameter increases, this ratio decreases, so that there are relatively more hy- drogen  bonds  holding  the  molecules  in  the  outer layer, decreasing the vapor pressure.

The  major  natural  sources  of  CCN  are meteoric dust, windblown clay and silt, volcanic ma- terial, smoke from forest fires, and sea salt.2 It is esti- mated that the natural concentrations of CCN are 50 to  100  per  cubic  centimeter  over  the  oceans, and  about  400  to  500  or  more  over  the  conti- nents  (Wallace  and  Hobbs  1977).  Human  activities produce CCN (chiefly combustion products, includ- ing the sulfur and nitrogen compounds that produce acid precipitation) in concentrations of 3,500 cm–3 or more.  Radke  and  Hobbs  (1976)  estimated  that  the global  anthropogenic  production  rate  of  CCN  may be  comparable  to  the  natural  production  rate.  In some industrial areas most CCN are anthropogenic and concentrations can reach 30,000 cm–3 (Miller et al. 1983). Condensation  releases  latent  heat  that  was  re- moved from the surface when the water evaporated, and the evaporation/condensation process is an im- portant mechanism of energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the libera- tion of latent heat in condensation produces a posi- tive  feedback  that  tends  to  sustain  the  precipitation process by warming the surrounding air, reducing its density, and increasing its tendency to rise, cool, and produce more condensation.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of condensation, why do small water droplets tend to evaporate?", "answer": "Small water droplets tend to evaporate because the ratio of the number of molecules in the surface layer to the number just below the surface is high, producing a high vapor pressure. As the droplet diameter increases, this ratio decreases, allowing more hydrogen bonds to form and hold the molecules in the outer layer, thus decreasing the vapor pressure. This indicates that the stability of water droplets is highly dependent on their size."}, {"question": "How does the formation of cloud droplets occur in the atmosphere?", "answer": "The formation of cloud droplets occurs when water-vapor molecules collide and form tiny droplets, but this process is highly unlikely to happen by random collision alone due to the instability of very small droplets. The presence of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which are particles larger than 10–4 mm, is necessary to provide substrates for condensation to occur. These particles can be of natural origin, such as meteoric dust, windblown clay, and silt, or anthropogenic, resulting from human activities like combustion."}, {"question": "In the context of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), what are the primary natural sources?", "answer": "The major natural sources of CCN are meteoric dust, windblown clay and silt, volcanic material, smoke from forest fires, and sea salt. These sources contribute to the natural concentrations of CCN, which are estimated to be around 50 to 100 per cubic centimeter over the oceans and about 400 to 500 or more over the continents."}, {"question": "Why is the evaporation/condensation process important in the context of energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere?", "answer": "The evaporation/condensation process is crucial because it releases latent heat that was removed from the surface when the water evaporated. This process acts as an important mechanism of energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the liberation of latent heat in condensation produces a positive feedback that tends to sustain the precipitation process by warming the surrounding air, reducing its density, and increasing its tendency to rise, cool, and produce more condensation."}, {"question": "How do human activities influence the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere?", "answer": "Human activities, particularly combustion processes, produce CCN, including sulfur and nitrogen compounds that contribute to acid precipitation. The concentrations of CCN from human activities can be significantly higher than natural concentrations, reaching levels of 3,500 cm–3 or more. In some industrial areas, anthropogenic CCN can dominate, with concentrations as high as 30,000 cm–3, indicating a substantial impact of human activities on the atmospheric CCN load."}, {"question": "In the context of condensation and precipitation, what role does latent heat play?", "answer": "Latent heat plays a critical role in the condensation and precipitation process. When condensation occurs, it releases latent heat that was previously removed from the surface during evaporation. This released heat warms the surrounding air, which in turn reduces its density and increases its tendency to rise. As the air rises, it cools, and the cooling air can produce more condensation, creating a positive feedback loop that sustains the precipitation process."}, {"question": "What are the implications of high concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on precipitation processes?", "answer": "High concentrations of CCN can significantly influence precipitation processes. With more CCN available, the atmosphere can support the formation of more cloud droplets, potentially leading to increased precipitation. However, the relationship between CCN concentrations and precipitation is complex and can be influenced by various factors, including the size and type of CCN, atmospheric conditions, and the presence of other aerosols. Understanding the implications of high CCN concentrations is essential for predicting precipitation patterns and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "How does the size of cloud droplets affect their stability and the condensation process?", "answer": "The size of cloud droplets is crucial for their stability and the condensation process. Very small droplets are unstable due to their high vapor pressure, which makes them prone to evaporation. As droplets grow in size, their vapor pressure decreases, and they become more stable. The formation of stable droplets requires the presence of CCN, which provide a substrate for condensation to occur. The growth of droplets to a size that can precipitate out of the atmosphere is a complex process influenced by factors such as the availability of CCN, atmospheric conditions, and the presence of updrafts or downdrafts."}, {"question": "In the context of energy exchange, how does the condensation process contribute to the warming of the atmosphere?", "answer": "The condensation process contributes to the warming of the atmosphere through the release of latent heat.

{"paragraph": "3.4.3 Droplet Growth The  preceding  discussion  shows  that  condensa- tion to form clouds occurs when: (1) water vapor is present;  (2)  there  is  a  sufficient  degree  of  uplift  to bring  about  cooling  to  the  dew  point;  and  (3)  suffi- cient  CCN  are  present.  This  condensation  forms cloud  droplets  with  diameters  in  the  range  0.001 to 0.2 mm (figure 3.5); droplets of this size range have fall velocities less than 0.7 m/s. Thus, In order for precipitation to fall from clouds to earth, some droplets must grow to a size such that their fall velocity exceeds the rate of uplift (usually greater than 1 m/s) and such that they can survive evaporation as they fall. There are two processes by which cloud droplets can  grow  several  orders  of  magnitude  to  form  rain- drops of 0.4 to 4 mm diameter, or snowflakes of even larger size: 1. collision  occurs  at  temperatures  above 0°C  because  condensation  on  CCN  produces cloud-water droplets of varying sizes. The larger droplets have larger fall velocities than the smaller ones and, because of this velocity dif- ferential, collisions occur between falling droplets of different sizes. Many of these collisions result in the coalescence of the two droplets and hence the gradual growth of the larger ones. Ultimately these become large enough to fall out of the cloud. 2. growth  occurs  in  clouds  at  tempera- Ice-crystal tures below 0°C. Typically, there are relatively few CCN present that are  effective  seeds  for  direct  condensation  as  ice crystals,  such  as  clay  minerals.  Thus  at  below- freezing  temperatures,  condensation  as  super- cooled liquid water on other types of CCN initially dominates. In the resulting mixture of ice crystals and water droplets, the saturation vapor pressure of an ice surface at a given temperature is somewhat less than the saturation vapor pressure of a liquid- water surface at that temperature (figure 3.3). This differential  causes  H O  molecules  to  evaporate from the liquid particles and condense as ice on the ice  crystals.  The  ice  crystals  thus  tend  to  grow  at the  expense  of  the  liquid  droplets,  and  eventually acquire a size and fall velocity that allows them to fall  through  the  cloud  as  snowflakes.  Further growth  by  collision  may  also  occur  as  the  flakes fall.  If  the  temperature  below  the  cloud  is  above 0°C, the snowflakes will melt and reach the earth as raindrops; otherwise they will fall as snow.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}, {"question": "In the context of cloud formation, what conditions are necessary for condensation to occur?", "answer": "Condensation to form clouds occurs when water vapor is present, there is a sufficient degree of uplift to bring about cooling to the dew point, and sufficient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are present."}, {"question": "How do cloud droplets grow to form raindrops or snowflakes?", "answer": "Cloud droplets grow through two processes: collision-coalescence at temperatures above 0°C, where larger droplets collide and merge with smaller ones due to differences in fall velocities, and growth in clouds at temperatures below 0°C, where ice crystals grow at the expense of supercooled liquid water droplets due to differences in saturation vapor pressure."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary for some cloud droplets to grow to a certain size for precipitation to occur?", "answer": "It is necessary for some cloud droplets to grow to a size such that their fall velocity exceeds the rate of uplift (usually greater than 1 m/s) and such that they can survive evaporation as they fall, allowing them to fall from clouds to earth as precipitation. This is because droplets with diameters in the range 0.001 to 0.2 mm have fall velocities less than 0.7 m/s, which is not sufficient for them to overcome the upward motion of the air and reach the ground."}, {"question": "In the context of ice crystal growth, how do differences in saturation vapor pressure influence the growth process?", "answer": "The saturation vapor pressure of an ice surface at a given temperature is somewhat less than the saturation vapor pressure of a liquid-water surface at that temperature. This differential causes H2O molecules to evaporate from the liquid particles and condense as ice on the ice crystals, leading to the growth of ice crystals at the expense of the liquid droplets."}, {"question": "What is the outcome of snowflakes falling through a layer of air with temperatures above 0°C?", "answer": "If the temperature below the cloud is above 0°C, the snowflakes will melt and reach the earth as raindrops. This process occurs because the snowflakes, which formed through the growth of ice crystals in the cloud, encounter warmer air as they fall, causing them to undergo a phase transition from solid to liquid."}, {"question": "How does the process of collision-coalescence contribute to the growth of cloud droplets?", "answer": "The process of collision-coalescence contributes to the growth of cloud droplets by allowing larger droplets to collide and merge with smaller ones due to differences in fall velocities. This process occurs at temperatures above 0°C and is an important mechanism for the growth of cloud droplets into larger raindrops. As larger droplets fall faster than smaller ones, they are more likely to collide and coalesce, leading to the gradual growth of the larger droplets."}, {"question": "In the context of cloud microphysics, why are CCN important for the formation of clouds?", "answer": "CCN are important for the formation of clouds because they provide a surface for water vapor to condense onto, allowing the formation of cloud droplets. The presence of sufficient CCN is one of the necessary conditions for condensation to occur, and the type and concentration of CCN can influence the size and distribution of cloud droplets."}, {"question": "What is the typical size range of cloud droplets formed through condensation?", "answer": "The typical size range of cloud droplets formed through condensation is 0.001 to 0.2 mm in diameter. These droplets have fall velocities less than 0.7 m/s, which is not sufficient for them to fall from clouds to earth as precipitation without further growth."}, {"question": "How do ice crystals grow in clouds at temperatures below 0°C?", "answer": "Ice crystals grow in clouds at temperatures below 0°C through a process where the saturation vapor pressure of an ice surface is less than that of a liquid-water surface at the same temperature. This differential causes H2O molecules to evaporate from supercooled liquid water droplets and condense as ice on the ice crystals, leading to their growth. The ice crystals can then continue to grow through additional processes, such as collision-coalescence, as they fall through the cloud."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation formation, what is the significance of the fall velocity of cloud droplets?", "answer": "The fall velocity of cloud droplets is significant because it determines whether they can overcome the upward motion of the air and reach the ground as precipitation. Cloud droplets with fall velocities less than 0.7 m/s are not able to fall from clouds to earth, and therefore must grow to larger sizes through processes such as collision-coalescence or ice crystal growth in order to become precipitation. The fall velocity of cloud droplets is influenced by their size, with larger droplets having higher fall velocities."}]}
{"paragraph": "3.4.4 Importation of Water Vapor The concentration of liquid water and/or ice in most clouds is in the range of 0.1 to 1 g/m3 (Gilman 1964).  The  following  computation  will  show  that even if all the water in a very thick cloud at a given time were to fall as rain, the total depth of precipita- tion would be relatively small: Consider  a  10,000-m  thick  cumulonimbus  (i.e., thunderhead)  cloud,  such  that  the  total  cloud  vol- ume above each 1 m2 of ground surface is 10,000 m3. If the concentration of water substance in the cloud is  1  the  total  volume  of  cloud  water  above each 1 m2 is 10,000 cm3. If all this water fell as pre- cipitation,  its  depth  would  be  1  cm.  This  value—a moderate  rainfall—represents  a  near  maximum  for the amount of precipitation produced by all the wa- ter initially present in a cloud at a given time. Thus,  since  most  rain-producing  clouds  are much less than 10,000 m in thickness and have water concentrations less than 1 g/m3, a final requirement for the production of significant amounts of precipi- tation is that Chapter 3 Principles and Processes A continual supply of water vapor must be imported into the cloud by converging winds to replace that which falls out (figure 3.6).

For instance, a 10,000-m thick cumulonimbus cloud with a water concentration of 1 g/m3 could produce a precipitation depth of 1 cm if all the water were to fall as rain. This indicates that even in thick clouds with high water concentrations, the potential depth of precipitation from the cloud's initial water content is relatively small."}, {"question": "Why is a continual supply of water vapor necessary for the production of significant amounts of precipitation?", "answer": "A continual supply of water vapor is necessary because the amount of water initially present in a cloud at any given time can only produce a limited amount of precipitation. For example, even a very thick cloud with high water concentration can only produce a moderate rainfall from its initial water content. Thus, to sustain significant precipitation, vapor-bearing winds must continually import water vapor into the cloud to replace the water that falls out as precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation production, how do the characteristics of rain-producing clouds impact the amount of precipitation they can produce?", "answer": "The characteristics of rain-producing clouds, such as their thickness and water concentration, significantly impact the amount of precipitation they can produce. Most rain-producing clouds are less than 10,000 m in thickness and have water concentrations less than 1 g/m3, which means they can produce less precipitation from their initial water content compared to thicker clouds with higher water concentrations. This underscores the importance of a continual supply of water vapor for significant precipitation production."}, {"question": "What would be the implication of a cloud's water concentration being at the higher end of the observed range on the potential precipitation depth?", "answer": "If a cloud's water concentration is at the higher end of the observed range (i.e., 1 g/m3), and considering a cloud of significant thickness (like a 10,000-m thick cumulonimbus), the potential precipitation depth could be near maximum for the amount of water initially present in the cloud. However, this still represents a moderate rainfall, highlighting that even under optimal conditions, the precipitation potential from a cloud's initial water content is limited, necessitating the importation of additional water vapor for sustained precipitation."}, {"question": "How does the process of water vapor importation into clouds facilitate the production of significant precipitation?", "answer": "The process of water vapor importation into clouds, facilitated by converging winds, is crucial for the production of significant precipitation. By continually supplying water vapor to the cloud, this process replaces the water that falls out as precipitation, thereby sustaining the cloud's precipitation-producing capability. This mechanism is essential because the initial water content of most clouds is insufficient to produce significant amounts of precipitation on its own, making the importation of water vapor a critical factor in determining the overall precipitation output of a cloud system."}, {"question": "In the context of cloud dynamics, why is the replacement of fallen precipitation crucial for sustained precipitation production?", "answer": "The replacement of fallen precipitation is crucial because the initial amount of water in a cloud is limited and can only produce a certain amount of precipitation. Once this water falls out, the cloud's ability to produce further precipitation is severely diminished unless it is replenished with additional water vapor. This replenishment, achieved through the importation of water vapor by converging winds, ensures that the cloud can continue to produce precipitation, thereby sustaining the precipitation process over time."}, {"question": "What role do converging winds play in the production of significant precipitation?", "answer": "Converging winds play a critical role in the production of significant precipitation by providing a continual supply of water vapor to the cloud. This supply of water vapor is essential for replacing the water that falls out as precipitation, thereby enabling the cloud to sustain its precipitation-producing capability. Without the importation of water vapor by converging winds, the precipitation potential of clouds would be severely limited by their initial water content."}, {"question": "How does the initial water content of a cloud influence its potential to produce significant precipitation?", "answer": "The initial water content of a cloud directly influences its potential to produce significant precipitation. Clouds with higher initial water content, in terms of both thickness and concentration, have a greater potential for producing precipitation. However, even in such cases, the potential is limited, and the cloud can only produce a moderate amount of precipitation from its initial water content. This limitation underscores the necessity of a continual supply of water vapor for sustained and significant precipitation production."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrology, what is the significance of understanding the relationship between cloud characteristics and precipitation production?", "answer": "Understanding the relationship between cloud"}]}

Later  we  consider  how  buoyancy  effects  may  en- hance  or  suppress  frictionally  generated  turbulence (section 3.5.3.7). If  the  surface  is  very  smooth,  there  is  an  ex- tremely thin (< 1 mm) layer in which the air’s viscos- ity  creates  a  frictional  drag.  More  commonly  this layer  is  absent and the surface friction  is due  to the roughness  of  vegetation  or  water  waves.  In  either case  the  friction  produces  a  surface  at  which  the wind velocity is zero (horizontal dashed lines in fig- ure 3.7); this is called the virtual surface. Below the virtual  surface  height  is  the interfacial  sublayer (Brutsaert  1992),  in  which  surface  roughness  ele- ments  suppress  turbulence.  Above  the  viscous  layer or the roughness features, the gradient of upward-in- creasing  vertical  velocity  induces  a  layer  of  pro- nounced  turbulence  that  defines  the  mixed  layer, Figure 3.7 Schematic diagram of velocity profiles in the lowest por- tion of the planetary boundary layer for surfaces of varying rough- ness (not to scale). z is elevation. This is the layer in which the sur- face directly affects atmospheric dynamics that control surface- atmosphere exchanges of heat and water vapor. It consists of the inter- facial sublayer, which extends from the surface to the horizontal dashed lines, where the wind velocity is zero. Above this is the turbulent mixed layer in which velocity increases upward (solid curves show the velocity profile). which is typically some tens of meters thick. Vertical fluxes  of  heat  and  water  vapor  are  essentially  con- stant throughout this layer. Consider  a  land  surface  across  which  a  steady wind is blowing. Because of turbulent eddies, the in- stantaneous  horizontal  wind  velocity,  u(z),  at  any level  z  above  the  virtual  surface  fluctuates  in  time. We  can  describe  this  situation  by  separating  the  in- stantaneous  velocity  into  a  time-averaged  compo- ), and a deviation from that average caused by the eddies, u′(z), so that at any instant = u(z) + u¢ where u′(z) may be positive or negative and the over- bar  denotes  time-averaging.

Turbu- lence is made visible by injecting oil droplets into the flow (image courtesy of Fernando Porté-Agel). Chapter 3 Principles and Processes Because  the  average  wind  speed  u(z)  increases upward in the mixed layer, a parcel of air moving up- ward  [i.e.,  with  >  0]  at  a  given  instant  has  a lower horizontal velocity than the average at the new level.

Under neutral conditions, the diffusivities of water  vapor  and  sensible  heat  can  be  assumed  to be identical to the diffusivity of momentum [equa- tion (3.32)] because the same turbulent eddies are responsible for the transport of all three quantities, as  assumed  in  deriving  the  relations  in  sections 3.5.3.4–3.5.3.6. the ambient lapse rate is steeper than the dry adia- batic lapse rate, because an elevated/lowered par- cel  will  be  warmer/cooler  and  hence  less  dense/ denser than the surrounding air (figure 3.13b) and hence  will  continue  to  rise/descend.

This variation in Γ affects the buoyancy-induced vertical acceleration of air parcels, thereby impacting the rates of turbulent exchange."}, {"question": "Why do stable conditions typically occur when warm air overlies a cold water surface or a snowpack?", "answer": "Stable conditions typically occur in these scenarios because the ambient lapse rate is less steep than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. When warm air is over a cold surface, it cools from the bottom, reducing its buoyancy and making it less likely to rise, thus stabilizing the atmosphere. This situation often leads to a temperature inversion, where temperature increases with height, further contributing to stability."}, {"question": "In the context of turbulent diffusion, how do buoyancy effects influence the transport of water vapor and sensible heat under unstable conditions?", "answer": "Under unstable conditions, buoyancy effects enhance the vertical transport of water vapor and sensible heat.

This warming or cooling affects the parcel's density relative to the surrounding air, which in turn influences its buoyancy and whether it continues to rise or fall, thus impacting the stability conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological processes, what role does atmospheric stability play in the formation of convective rainfall?", "answer": "Atmospheric stability, particularly unstable conditions, plays a significant role in the formation of convective rainfall. Unstable conditions, often resulting from strong surface heating by the sun, enhance vertical transport and can lead to the upward movement of moist air, which cools and condenses, forming clouds and potentially leading to convective rainfall. This process highlights the importance of considering atmospheric stability in hydrological modeling, especially for predicting precipitation patterns."}, {"question": "Why are practical approaches to accounting for stability effects in near-surface turbulent diffusion necessary?", "answer": "Practical approaches are necessary because the theoretical understanding of stability effects, while comprehensive, must be adapted to real-world scenarios where the lapse rate varies significantly.

This adjustment allows for more accurate predictions of water vapor and heat transport, taking into account the effects of atmospheric stability on turbulent eddies."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Richardson number in characterizing the stability state of the atmosphere, and how is it related to the transport of water vapor and heat?", "answer": "The Richardson number is significant in characterizing the stability state of the atmosphere because it provides a dimensionless measure of the ratio of the rate of destruction of turbulent kinetic energy by buoyancy forces to the rate of production of that energy by surface roughness acting on the horizontal wind flow. This number is related to the transport of water vapor and heat because it influences the growth or suppression of turbulent eddies, which in turn affect the efficiency of water vapor and heat transport. A low Richardson number indicates unstable conditions, promoting the growth of turbulent eddies and enhancing the transport of water vapor and heat, while a high Richardson number indicates stable conditions, suppressing turbulent eddies and reducing the transport."}]}

{"paragraph": "4.1.1 Fronts and Extra-Tropical Cyclones An air mass is a subcontinental-scale body of air within  which  temperature,  humidity,  and  lapse  rate are essentially uniform at a given elevation. Air cir- culating for several days over extensive surfaces takes on  the  characteristics  of  that  surface,  and  can  be identified as one of six air-mass types (table 4.1). The characteristics of a given air mass are modified as it moves  (see,  for  example,  Barry  and  Chorley  1987), Table 4.1 Characteristics and Origins of Major Air-Mass Types in the Northern Hemisphere. Air-Mass Type Characteristics Winter Continental arctic (cA) Very cold, moist Arctic Ocean/Greenland Continental polar (cP) Cold, dry Eastern Europe Northern Asia Canada/northern United States Continental tropical (cT) Warm, dry North Africa Arabia/Himalayas Mexico/California Maritime arctic (mA) Very cold, moist Maritime polar (mP) Cold, moist Northern Pacific Ocean Western North Atlantic Ocean Maritime tropical (mT) Warm, moist Central Atlantic Ocean Gulf of Mexico Central Pacific Ocean Bay of Bengal Arabian Sea Source: Barry and Chorley (1987). but  it  typically  maintains  its  general  identity  for many days. Fronts are boundaries between contrast- ing air masses; these are regions about 100 to 200 km wide  in  which  horizontal  temperature  and  pressure gradients are relatively large. Figure  4.1  describes  the  process  of cyclogenesis at  fronts.  While  few  actual  cyclones  follow  this  se- quence  exactly,  it  provides  a  framework  for  under- standing the major precipitation-producing processes in the midlatitudes. The isobars (lines of equal atmo- spheric  pressure)  at  fronts  are  subparallel,  and  the front is a low-pressure trough typically with relatively cold, denser air to the north and warm, less dense air to the south (figure 4.1a). Because the circulations of the abutting air masses are clockwise, wind blows in opposite directions on either side of the front to create a zone of wind shear. Often, the eddies generated in this zone trigger instabilities in the boundary that ap- pear as waves when viewed in plan. Outside the trop- ics,  where  Coriolis  force  is  significant,  these  waves typically  develop  into  cyclones.  Much extratropical of  the  precipitation  between  approximately  30°  and 60°N and S latitudes is associated with extratropical cyclones.  These  storms  are  also  the  principal  agents of poleward energy transfer in the midlatitudes. Cyclonic storms form when the frontal wave de- velops further, such that the counterclockwise circu- Source Regions Northern Siberia Northern Canada North Africa Arabia/central Asia Mexico/southwest United States Arctic Ocean/Greenland Northern Pacific Ocean Central North Atlantic Ocean Central Atlantic Ocean Gulf of Mexico Central Pacific Ocean lation around the wave apex intensifies (figure 4.1c). To the west of the apex, cold air displaces the warm air  to  create  a  front,  and  the  warmer  air  rises along the frontal surface. East of the apex the warm air displaces cold air at the surface to create a warm front, and the warmer air rises along the frontal sur- face here also. Cloud formation, often leading to pre- cipitation,  commonly  occurs  along  one  or  both frontal surfaces (figure 4.2a) and at the apex, where the air converging at the center of the counterclock- wise circulation must also rise. Typically, cold fronts Figure 4.1 Typical sequence of development of extratropical cyclones (map view). Arrows indicate wind flow.

(e) Front largely occluded. Dashed line Chapter 4 Precipitation have relatively steep slopes, about 1 in 30 to 40, while warm fronts have slopes of 1 in 60 to 120; thus pre- cipitation  is  usually  more  intense  and  areally  more concentrated at cold fronts than at warm fronts. Note that  the  isobars  now  form  a  quasi-circular  pattern around  a  low-pressure  center  at  the  apex  (figure 4.1c); typically the diameter of a fully developed cy- clonic circulation is on the order of 1,500 km. Cold fronts usually move faster than warm fronts, so  the  evolution  of  an  extratropical  cyclone  typically follows  a  sequence  something  like  the  one  shown  in Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Figure 4.2 Cross-sectional view of extratropical cyclone development. Arrows indicate wind flow. (a) Section through warm sector along dashed line of figure 4.1(d). (b) Sections for two types of occluded fronts along dashed line of figure 4.1e [Miller et al. (1984)]. figures 4.1c and 4.1d. Where the cold front overtakes the  warm  front  there  is  colder  air  everywhere  at  the surface with warm air above, and the front is said to be occluded (figure 4.1e). Although the air-mass contrast at the surface is now weaker, it is still present aloft (fig- ure 4.2b) and the rising of the warm air over the cold may  continue  to  generate  precipitation—in  fact,  the maximum rainfall intensity usually occurs during the early stages of occlusion (Miller et al. 1983). Ultimately,  several  processes  combine  to  bring the rain production to a halt: the temperature differ- ence  between  the  air  masses  decreases  due  to  adia- batic cooling of the rising warm air and warming of descending  cold  air,  the  pressure  contrast  that  initi- ated  the  convergence  is  reduced,  and  the  inflow  of moisture is reduced (figure 4.1f). Evolution to the stage shown in figure 4.1c usu- ally  takes  12  to  24  hr,  and  the  process  is  typically completed in another two or three days (Miller et al. 1983).  Because  the  development  takes  place  in  the zone  of  westerly  winds,  the  low-pressure  center  at the apex of the cyclonic circulation moves generally eastward,  at  a  speed  of  about  1,000  km/day,  as  the cyclone evolves. Figure  4.3  is  a  weather  map  showing  a  typical extratropical  cyclonic  storm  over  North  America, generating  precipitation  over  an  area  of  some 500,000  Precipitation  associated  with  extra- tropical cyclones thus covers wide areas, and persists for tens of hours to days at a given location. Because rates of uplift are relatively low, precipitation intensi- ties  are  generally  low  to  moderate.  As  noted  above, precipitation  at  cold  fronts  usually  covers  a  smaller area and is more intense than warm-front precipita- tion, and on occasion rates of uplift at cold fronts are similar to that produced by thermal convection (see below), producing bands of intense thunderstorms. On a given winter day there are usually about 10 cyclonic  storms  in  various  stages  of  development throughout the midlatitudes. The net result of these storms,  in  addition  to  the  production  of  precipita- tion, is the climatically critical equatorward transfer of colder air and the poleward transfer of warmer air and latent heat of condensation (figure 2.10).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of air masses, what are the primary characteristics that define them?", "answer": "The primary characteristics that define air masses include temperature, humidity, and lapse rate, which are essentially uniform at a given elevation. These characteristics are modified as the air mass moves but typically maintain their general identity for many days. There are six major air-mass types, each with distinct characteristics such as cold and dry or warm and moist, depending on the surface over which the air has circulated."}, {"question": "How do fronts form between contrasting air masses, and what are their typical widths?", "answer": "Fronts are boundaries between contrasting air masses where horizontal temperature and pressure gradients are relatively large. These regions are typically about 100 to 200 km wide. The formation of fronts is a result of the interaction between different air masses, leading to areas of significant weather changes, including precipitation."}, {"question": "In the process of cyclogenesis, why do cyclonic storms form, and what is the role of wind shear in this process?", "answer": "Cyclonic storms form when the frontal wave develops further, intensifying the counterclockwise circulation around the wave apex. Wind shear plays a crucial role in this process by creating a zone where eddies are generated, triggering instabilities in the boundary that can appear as waves. These waves, under the influence of the Coriolis force outside the tropics, typically develop into cyclones. The wind shear is a result of the clockwise circulation of the abutting air masses, causing winds to blow in opposite directions on either side of the front."}, {"question": "What is the significance of extratropical cyclones in the midlatitudes, and how do they contribute to precipitation and energy transfer?", "answer": "Extratropical cyclones are significant in the midlatitudes as they are the principal agents of poleward energy transfer and are associated with much of the precipitation between approximately 30° and 60°N and S latitudes. These storms contribute to precipitation through the process of cyclogenesis, where the rising of warm air over cold air leads to cloud formation and precipitation. Additionally, they play a crucial role in the transfer of energy from the equator towards the poles, influencing climate patterns."}, {"question": "How do cold and warm fronts differ in terms of slope and precipitation intensity, and what are the implications for precipitation patterns?", "answer": "Cold fronts have relatively steep slopes, about 1 in 30 to 40, while warm fronts have slopes of 1 in 60 to 120. This difference in slope leads to more intense and areally concentrated precipitation at cold fronts compared to warm fronts. The implications of this difference are significant for precipitation patterns, as cold fronts can produce bands of intense thunderstorms, whereas warm fronts tend to produce more widespread but less intense precipitation."}, {"question": "In the context of extratropical cyclone development, why does the cold front usually overtake the warm front, leading to occlusion?", "answer": "The cold front usually overtakes the warm front because it moves faster. This leads to a situation where there is colder air everywhere at the surface with warm air above, resulting in an occluded front. Although the air-mass contrast at the surface is weaker at this stage, it is still present aloft, and the rising of the warm air over the cold may continue to generate precipitation. The process of occlusion is a critical phase in the evolution of an extratropical cyclone, affecting the distribution and intensity of precipitation."}, {"question": "What processes combine to bring rain production to a halt in the later stages of extratropical cyclone development?", "answer": "Several processes combine to bring rain production to a halt, including the decrease in temperature difference between the air masses due to adiabatic cooling of the rising warm air and warming of descending cold air, the reduction in pressure contrast that initiated the convergence, and the reduction in the inflow of moisture. These processes ultimately lead to the cessation of precipitation as the cyclone evolves and the conditions for cloud formation and precipitation are no longer met."}, {"question": "How do extratropical cyclones contribute to the equatorward transfer of colder air and the poleward transfer of warmer air and latent heat of condensation?", "answer": "Extratropical cyclones contribute to these transfers through their circulation patterns. As they move generally eastward, they facilitate the equatorward transfer of colder air and the poleward transfer of warmer air and latent heat of condensation. This process is climatically critical, as it influences the distribution of heat around the globe and plays a significant role in shaping climate patterns, particularly in the midlatitudes."}, {"question": "In the context of midlatitude weather patterns, what is the typical frequency and duration of extratropical cyclonic storms?", "answer": "On a given winter day, there are usually about 10 cyclonic storms in various stages of development throughout the midlatitudes.

Understanding the ITCZ's behavior and its impacts on precipitation is essential for managing water resources and predicting hydrological events in these regions."}, {"question": "How does the spatial discontinuity and intermittency of the ITCZ affect its role in global precipitation patterns?", "answer": "The spatial discontinuity and intermittency of the ITCZ mean that its impact on precipitation is not uniform across all tropical regions.

The ability to predict these migrations and their effects is crucial for adapting water management strategies to changing hydrological conditions."}, {"question": "How does the creation of the ITCZ relate to the general circulation of the atmosphere?", "answer": "The creation of the ITCZ is directly related to the general circulation of the atmosphere, specifically the equatorward air flow in the low-latitude cells (Hadley cells). This air flow leads to a zone of convergence near the equator, which is the ITCZ. The general circulation pattern, therefore, plays a fundamental role in the formation and maintenance of the ITCZ, highlighting the interconnectedness of atmospheric and hydrological processes."}, {"question": "In the context of climate variability, what challenges does the ITCZ pose for predicting hydrological events?", "answer": "The ITCZ poses significant challenges for predicting hydrological events due to its spatial discontinuity, intermittency, and seasonal migration. These characteristics make it difficult to accurately forecast precipitation patterns and, consequently, hydrological responses such as runoff and flooding. This unpredictability necessitates the development of sophisticated models and monitoring systems that can capture the complex behavior of the ITCZ and its impacts on regional hydrology."}, {"question": "Why is the ITCZ considered persistent despite its spatial discontinuity and intermittency?", "answer": "The ITCZ is considered persistent because, despite its spatial discontinuity and intermittency, it consistently creates a band of high average precipitation near the equator.

{"paragraph": "4.1.3 Tropical Cyclones Tropical cyclones are cyclonic storms that form over the North and South Pacific and the North At- lantic oceans between 5° and 20° latitude. They have the  potential  to  develop  into  extremely  intense storms,  which  are  called  hurricanes  (North  Amer- Ocean), and baguios (China Sea). Tropical-cyclone  formation  is  not  associated with fronts. It begins with a small low-pressure dis- turbance in a maritime tropical air mass. Sea-surface temperatures of at least 27°C (Miller et al. 1983) are required to induce high rates of evaporation into the Chapter 4 Precipitation converging and rising air; the cooling of this air then triggers condensation, and the accompanying release of  latent  heat  further  fuels  the  uplift.  If  conditions are  right,  the  circulation  will  intensify  until  winds near  the  center  reach  speeds  as  high  as  65  m/s.  A fully developed hurricane (by convention, a tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its winds exceed 33 m/s) has the structure shown in figures 4.4 and 4.5 (on p. 139). Because they form in the belt of easterly winds, the  initial  movement  of  hurricanes  is  usually  west- ward;  however,  they  often  move  poleward  into  the zone  of  westerly winds  and  may  be  swept  well  into the  midlatitudes  (figure  4.6  on  p.  139).  Because  of the  reduction  in  evaporation,  their  intensity  lessens when  they  move  over  colder  water  or,  especially, land. However, they can persist for thousands of ki- lometers over land, moving at speeds of about 5 to 7 m/s and delivering very high rates of rainfall, as well as destructive winds, over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Figures  4.7  and  4.8  on  p.  140  show  the  global frequency  and  seasonality  of  tropical  cyclones.  The concentration of storms in the summer/early fall re- flects the  necessity  of high sea-surface  temperatures in triggering hurricane development. Most  of  the  highest  riverine  floods  of  medium- to  large-size  drainage  basins  along  the  eastern  sea- board of the United States have been caused by hur- ricanes.  Notable  examples  (among  many)  include which dumped between 7 and 15 cm of rain in 24 hr on most of New England (Brooks 1940) and caused massive flooding; Hurricane Agnes, which spent al- most a week over the Middle Atlantic states in June 1972 and produced exceptionally serious flooding in the Carolinas, near record floods in Virginia, and re- cord-breaking  floods  in  central  Pennsylvania  and western  New  York  (Hopkins  1973);  and  Hurricane Irene,  which  produced  widespread  devastating floods throughout Vermont in August 2011.

However, they often move poleward into the zone of westerly winds and may be swept well into the midlatitudes. The movement and trajectory of these storms can be influenced by various factors, including the wind patterns they encounter."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological impacts, why are tropical cyclones significant contributors to extreme rainfall events and riverine floods?", "answer": "Tropical cyclones are significant contributors to extreme rainfall events and riverine floods because they can deliver very high rates of rainfall over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. This is particularly evident in the eastern seaboard of the United States, where most of the highest riverine floods of medium- to large-size drainage basins have been caused by hurricanes. The intense rainfall from these storms can lead to massive flooding, as seen in examples such as Hurricane Agnes and Hurricane Irene, which produced exceptionally serious flooding in various regions."}, {"question": "What happens to the intensity of tropical cyclones when they move over colder water or land, and why does this occur?", "answer": "The intensity of tropical cyclones lessens when they move over colder water or land. This reduction in intensity occurs because of the decrease in evaporation, which is essential for maintaining the storm's energy. Over land, the lack of moisture and the increased friction also contribute to the weakening of the storm."}, {"question": "In the context of long-term hydrological effects, how can tropical cyclones impact evapotranspiration and river flow in affected regions?", "answer": "Tropical cyclones can have lasting hydrologic effects, such as reducing evapotranspiration by destroying trees and other vegetation. For example, the '38 Hurricane destroyed so many trees in central New England that evapotranspiration was reduced, leading to a significant increase in the annual flow of rivers draining the region in the following three years. This demonstrates that the impacts of tropical cyclones can extend beyond the immediate flooding and rainfall, influencing the regional hydrology for years after the event."}, {"question": "Why do tropical cyclones tend to form and intensify during the summer and early fall seasons in certain ocean basins?", "answer": "Tropical cyclones tend to form and intensify during the summer and early fall seasons because high sea-surface temperatures are necessary for their development. The concentration of storms during these seasons reflects the necessity of warm ocean waters for triggering hurricane development. This seasonal pattern is evident in the global frequency and seasonality of tropical cyclones, as shown in figures illustrating the activity by ocean basin."}, {"question": "How do changes in precipitation per storm and storm frequency contribute to the increasing contribution of tropical cyclones to extreme rainfall events in certain regions?", "answer": "Changes in precipitation per storm and storm frequency are contributing to the increasing contribution of tropical cyclones to extreme rainfall events in regions such as the southeastern United States. Research has found that the contribution of tropical cyclone precipitation to extreme rainfalls in this region has been increasing by 5 to 10% per decade due to increases in precipitation per storm and frequency of storms.

{"paragraph": "4.1.5 Orographic Precipitation In  most  regions  of  the  world,  long-term  mean precipitation  increases  with  elevation  due  to uplift.  This  occurs  because  horizontally moving air encounters a topographic barrier and ac- quires  a  vertical  component  of  motion  as  it  flows over that barrier. The rate and degree of cooling are Figure 4.10 Fair-weather cumulus clouds formed by thermal convection over Cuba. Note that the clouds are present only over the land—the heat capacity of the sea prevents it from heating suffi- ciently to cause convection (photo by author). Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange determined  by  the  wind  speed,  the  wind  direction relative to the barrier, the steepness and height of the barrier,  and  the  temperature  and  humidity  condi- tions that control convective stability. Although  the  orographic  effect  is  widespread, the  rates  of  increase  of  precipitation  with  elevation vary widely from region to region (figure 4.12), and may even reverse at the highest elevations, especially in tropical regions (Barry and Chorley 1982). Within a region of orographic effect, the precipitation-eleva- tion relation varies as a function of the aspect and in- clination of individual slope facets and their relation to local topographic barriers. Barros and Lettenmaier (1994)  reported orographic enhancement of  precipi- tation by factors of 150 to 185% for hills up to a few hundred meters relief, and more than 300% when re- lief  exceeds  1  to  2  km.  However,  orographic  effects can  be  produced  by  topographic  rises  of  only  a  few meters (Barry and Chorley 1982); figure 4.13 shows cumulus  clouds  induced  by  relatively  small  hills  in the southern Great Plains of the United States. Clouds and precipitation form on the windward slope of the topographic barrier, and peak precipita- tion  often  occurs  windward  of  the  crest.  The  down- ward  air  movement  on  the  lee  side  causes  adiabatic warming,  which  tends  to  dissipate  the  clouds  and Figure 4.11 Mean annual num- ber of thunderstorm days in the United States [US National Weather Service (http:// www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/ tstorms/tstorms_intro.htm)]. thus turn off the precipitation-producing process, pro- ducing a rain shadow. A classic orographic situation exists  in  the  central  West  Coast  of  North  America (figure  4.14  on  p.  144),  where  a  series  of  mountain ranges  are  nearly  perpendicular  to  persistent,  moist westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean, and there is a close  relation  between  long-term  average  precipita- tion and topography over a distance of 850 km. The reduced precipitation east of the Fraser Valley occurs because  the  air  has  lost  most  of  its  moisture  by  this point, but a subdued orographic effect persists. In  many,  if  not  most,  situations,  orographic  ef- fects are the result of convective, frontal, or cyclonic mechanisms interacting with topography rather than a separate precipitation-generating mechanism. Even in the classic situation shown in figure 4.14, much of the precipitation  comes  from  extratropical  cyclones. The orographic effect is due to: (1) an increase in the duration of precipitation at higher elevations, and/or (2)  higher  intensities  at  higher  elevations  when  pre- cipitation is occurring at all elevations. The effect of increased duration is shown in figure 4.15 on p. 145 for an intensely gauged region in New England. Hen- drick et al. (1978) also reported a threefold increase in hours of winter precipitation between 400 m and 1,200  m  elevation  in  northern  Vermont,  but  found Figure 4.12 Relations between mean annual precipitation and eleva- tion in several regions of North Amer- ica [data from Barry and Chorley (1982) and Dingman et al.

Because  topography  is  permanent,  orographic effects  are  reflected  in  long-term  average  precipita- tion values, and some of the highest average precipi- tation rates globally are due to orographic effects (see section  4.4.3.1).  A  well-known  example  occurs  in conjunction with the monsoon over the Indian sub- continent: In summer, a northward shift in the posi- tion  of  the  ITCZ  and  accompanying  changes  in circulation  patterns  induce  moist  southerly  winds from  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  These  winds  converge  and rise  over  the  Khasi  Hills  in  Assam,  India  (north  of Bangladesh),  producing  persistent  heavy  rains  and giving the city of Cherrapunji (elevation 1,402 m) the highest  measured  average  annual  rainfall  in  the world:  11,872  mm/yr,  more  than  half  of  which  oc- Chapter 4 Precipitation curs  in  June,  July,  and  August  (see  table  4.9).  An- other extreme orographic situation is Mt. Waialeale in Kauai, Hawaii (1,570 m), where the average pre- cipitation is 11,684 mm/yr. Orographic  effects  can  also  produce  extreme rainfall events. Smith et al. (2011) showed that some of the largest rainfall totals ever recorded for storms of  less  than  6-hr  duration  were  produced  by  oro- graphically  enhanced  convective  thunderstorms  in the central Appalachian region of the United States (section  4.4.3.1).  They  found  that  the  frequency  of catastrophic flooding in that region is controlled by the  effect  of  complex  terrain  in  altering  thunder- storm dynamics. In  regions  with  significant  relief  and  otherwise similar climate, the orographic effect commonly ac- counts for much of the spatial variation of precipita- Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange tion. For example, Dingman et al. (1988) found that elevation accounted for 78% of the spatial variation in long-term mean precipitation in New Hampshire and Vermont. Thus, one can often exploit the effect in estimating the average precipitation over a region, as in the hypsometric method discussed later in this chapter.  The  orographic  effect  can  also  carry  over into  many  hydrological  relations:  Dingman  (1981) showed that average streamflows, dry-season stream- flows, and floods were all significantly related to ele- vation in central New England.

Even small topographic rises of only a few meters can produce significant orographic effects, as demonstrated by the formation of cumulus clouds induced by relatively small hills in the southern Great Plains of the United States.

{"paragraph": "4.1.6 Occult Precipitation and Dew precipitation  is  precipitation  that  is “combed out” of clouds that encounter trees or other vegetation,  and  which  is  therefore  not  captured  by normally sited precipitation gauges. Fog drip occurs when  clouds  move  through  forests,  cloud  droplets are  deposited  on  vegetative  surfaces,  and  the  water drips  to  the  ground.  Rime  is  formed  when  super- cooled  clouds  encounter  exposed  objects,  such  as trees, that provide nucleation sites for ice-crystal for- mation and the buildup of ice, much of which even- tually falls to the ground in solid or liquid form. Several studies have shown that occult precipita- tion is hydrologically important in many high-eleva- tion  areas  and  in  certain  other  environments.  For example,  fog  drip  amounts  to  about  450  mm/yr (20%  of  annual  precipitation)  at  elevations  above 1,200  m  in  northern  New  England  (Lovett  et  al. 1982);  about  880  mm/yr  (about  30%  of  the  annual precipitation) in a Douglas fir forest in Oregon (Harr 1982); and is the sole source of water in “cloud for- ests” on the rainless coast of Peru (Lull 1964). Rime contributes  38  to  50  mm/yr  to  water  input  in  the Cascade  Mountains  in  Washington  (Berndt  and Fowler 1969) and 20 to 30 mm/yr in the mountains of New Mexico (Gary 1972). Dew forms under conditions of radiant cooling when the temperature of a surface (e.g., soil or a leaf) falls  below  the  dew  point  and  vapor  condenses  on the surface. The amount of dewfall is determined by how  much  and  for  how  long  the  temperature  is  be- low the dew point, the humidity, the air circulation, and  the  properties  of  the  surface  (Monteith  1957). The  ratio  of  potential  condensation  to  potential evaporation  is  roughly  1:7  in  humid  climates  and 1:14 in arid climates, so dew generally does not con- tribute significantly to long-term precipitation. How- ever, in semiarid and arid regions, dewfall can equal or  exceed  all  other  forms  of  precipitation  for  ex- tended periods, e.g., totals of 50 to 100 mm/yr were reported  in  the  Negev  Desert  of  Israel  (Zangvil 1996),  and  in  humid  regions  it  may  be  the  biggest component over short periods. For example, Xiao et al. (2009) found that dew contributed up to 6.9% of the annual precipitation and over 20% of the precipi- tation of some months to crops and grass in northern Germany. In spite of its generally small contribution to  precipitation  totals,  it  appears  that  dew  contrib- utes  significantly  to  the  efficiency  of  water  use  by plants in humid as well as arid regions (Ben-Asher et al. 2010).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of high-elevation areas, what is the significance of occult precipitation?", "answer": "Occult precipitation is hydrologically important in many high-elevation areas, contributing significantly to the annual precipitation.

However, in semiarid and arid regions, dewfall can equal or exceed all other forms of precipitation for extended periods, especially under conditions of high humidity and low air circulation.

{"paragraph": "4.1.7 Moisture Sources and Precipitation Recycling The  global  precipitation  recycling  ratio  was  de- fined in section 2.2.8.4 as the fraction of land precipita- tion that originates as continental evapotranspiration; this value averages 40% (table 2.13). As shown in fig- ure  2.45,  more  than  half  the  precipitation  in  central South  America,  western  Africa,  and  a  large  part  of Asia,  including  most  of  China,  originates  as  land evapotranspiration. This ratio is important in assessing feedbacks that could affect hydrologic response to cli- mate and the potential for direct human modification of climate through land-use changes. The local recycling ratio is the ratio of precipita- tion  in  a  particular  region  that  originates  as  evapo- transpiration from that region. Table 4.2 summarizes some  estimates  of  local  recycling  ratios.  Two  envi- ronmentally  sensitive  regions  have  been  found  to have  particularly  high  values  of  local  recycling:  the Amazon basin, and the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa.  In  the  Amazon,  Lee  and  Boyce  (2010)  esti- mated  that  the  transpiration  of  flowering  plants  in- creases recycling of precipitation up to ~300 mm/yr (20% of total precipitation), increases the wet-season duration,  and  decreases  atmospheric  stability  that promotes  precipitation; it  is feared that the destruc- tion of the rain forest will significantly affect at least the  regional  hydrologic  cycle  (Lean  and  Warrilow 1989).

Local  precipitation  recycling  is  at  least  season- ally important in other regions, and in some places is enhanced  by  land-use  modifications.  Evaporation from  large  lakes,  such  as  the  Laurentian  Great Lakes, gives rise to localized regions of high precipi- tation  on  their  downwind  shores,  especially  in  late fall and early winter. Similar effects have been found from  large  reservoirs:  Degu  et  al.

In  central  Alaska, moisture  evapotranspired  from  extensive  wetlands during summer may contribute a significant propor- tion  of  that  season’s  precipitation.  A  similar  effect, but due to irrigation, occurs in the US Great Plains: DeAngelis et al.

In these regions, changes in land use, such as deforestation, can significantly impact the regional hydrologic cycle.

Similarly, irrigation can increase evapotranspiration, which in turn can produce precipitation increases downwind, as observed in the US Great Plains where high evapotranspiration over heavily irrigated areas correlates with warm-season rain up to 1,000 km downwind."}, {"question": "What role does evapotranspiration from wetlands play in central Alaska's precipitation during summer?", "answer": "In central Alaska, moisture evapotranspired from extensive wetlands during summer may contribute a significant proportion of that season's precipitation, indicating the importance of wetlands in the local hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "How do large reservoirs influence precipitation patterns in Mediterranean and semiarid climates?", "answer": "Large reservoirs can influence precipitation patterns in Mediterranean and semiarid climates by enhancing humidity, convective instability, and precipitation in regions downwind of the reservoirs. This effect is due to the evaporation from the reservoirs, which can lead to increased precipitation, especially in areas with highly seasonal precipitation patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of the US Great Plains, what is the relationship between irrigation and precipitation?", "answer": "In the US Great Plains, there is a correlation between high evapotranspiration over heavily irrigated areas and warm-season rain up to 1,000 km downwind, resulting in precipitation increases of 15 to 30%. This relationship suggests that irrigation can significantly impact local precipitation patterns by increasing evapotranspiration, which in turn enhances precipitation downwind."}, {"question": "Why is understanding local precipitation recycling ratios important for assessing hydrologic responses to climate change?", "answer": "Understanding local precipitation recycling ratios is important because it helps in assessing feedbacks that could affect hydrologic response to climate change. High local recycling ratios indicate that a significant portion of precipitation in a region originates from within that region, making the region's hydrologic cycle more sensitive to changes in land use and climate. This understanding is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on regional hydrology, especially in environmentally sensitive areas like the Amazon basin and the Sahel."}, {"question": "How does the destruction of the rain forest in the Amazon basin affect the regional hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "The destruction of the rain forest in the Amazon basin is feared to significantly affect the regional hydrologic cycle. This is because the transpiration of flowering plants in the Amazon increases recycling of precipitation, which in turn affects the wet-season duration and atmospheric stability. The loss of this transpiration due to deforestation could lead to changes in the regional precipitation patterns, highlighting the importance of preserving the rain forest to maintain the hydrologic balance in the region."}, {"question": "What are the implications of high local recycling ratios in regions like the Sahel for desertification?", "answer": "High local recycling ratios in regions like the Sahel can produce positive feedbacks that amplify desertification due to intensive land use.

{"paragraph": "4.1.8 Determining Precipitation Type Weather observations usually report only the total liquid-water equivalent of precipitation without speci- fying whether it fell as rain, sleet, or snow. Obviously the type of precipitation is critical hydrologic informa- tion,  because  rain  immediately  recharges  soil  water and/or moves quickly to streams, whereas snow may be stored for extended time periods before melting. Outside  the  tropics,  most  precipitation  origi- nates  as  snow  in  supercooled  clouds  (section  3.4), and the type of precipitation reaching the surface is determined  by  the  height  of  the  0°C  surface:  Rain Chapter 4 Precipitation occurs  if  that  surface  is  high  enough  to  allow  com- plete melting, sleet occurs if there is partial melting, and  snow  if  no  melting.  In  a  study  in  the  Cascade Mountains  in  the  United  States,  Maurer  and  Mass (2006)  showed  that  observations  of  freezing  height by vertically oriented radar did provide reliable parti- tioning  (see  also  Bocchieri  1980).  Because  such  ob- servations  are  not  widely  available,  the  partitioning decision has usually been based on local surface air temperature, which is typically reported at precipita- tion-gauge  sites.  However,  surface  lapse  rates  are highly variable in space and time, so a fixed air-tem- perature criterion is likely to be unreliable. Clearly a sound and practical basis for determin- ing  precipitation  type  would  be  extremely  valuable; for example, Rutter et al. (2009) found that accurate partitioning of rain/snow had a major influence on the  success  of  snowmelt  models.  Ding  et  al.  (2014) reviewed  published  partitioning  algorithms  based solely  on  air temperature;  they  found  that they var- ied  considerably  and  generally  had  success  rates  of well  under  50%  when  applied  to  new  conditions when air temperatures were in the range 0–4°C. Us- ing over 400,000 observations from a 29-yr period at over 700 stations in China, they formulated an alter- native algorithm based on station elevation, daily av- erage  humidity,  and  daily  average wet-bulb (box  4.1).  Wet-bulb  temperature  is  the temperature temperature that a parcel of air would reach if it were cooled  to  saturation  by  the  evaporation  of  water, with all the latent heat of evaporation supplied by the parcel. Thus it approximates the temperature of pre- cipitation  more  closely  than  does  air  temperature. Wet-bulb temperature can be calculated as a function of air temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pres- sure (equation 4B1.1). As  shown  in  figure  4.16  on  p.  149,  Ding  et  al. (2014)  found  that  the  rain/sleet  and  sleet/snow boundaries shifted toward higher wet-bulb tempera- tures  as  station  elevation  increased,  and  that  the probability of sleet increased strongly as relative hu- midity increased. Their algorithm incorporates these effects,  and  had  success  rates  between  53  and  66% when  air  temperatures  were  in  the  range  0–4°C, which  is  considerably  better  than  approaches  based on air temperature alone. Since the method is based on  a  very  large  data  base  and  diverse  conditions,  it appears to be the most reliable practical approach for partitioning. However, it has not been tested outside China,  and  significant  uncertainty  remains  about precipitation type at temperatures near 0°C. Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Box 4.1 Rain/Snow Partitioning of Precipitation As noted in the text, precipitation is almost always recorded as a depth of liquid water for a given time period, without specification as to whether it fell as rain, sleet, or snow. The type is critical for hydrologic analysis and modeling, so some algorithm must be used to determine it. The method developed by Ding et al. (2014), which is based on station elevation, wet-bulb temperature, and humidity, was far more successful in partitioning than algorithms based on air temperature alone and is described here. Their procedure approxi- mates the effects of elevation and humidity on precipi- tation type that are shown in figure 4.16.

Rain immediately recharges soil water and/or moves quickly to streams, whereas snow may be stored for extended time periods before melting. This distinction is essential for accurate hydrologic modeling and analysis."}, {"question": "How does the height of the 0°C surface influence the type of precipitation reaching the surface?", "answer": "The height of the 0°C surface determines the type of precipitation reaching the surface.

If there is partial melting, it occurs as sleet, and if there is no melting, it occurs as snow."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation type partitioning algorithms, what are the limitations of using air temperature alone?", "answer": "Using air temperature alone to determine precipitation type is unreliable due to highly variable surface lapse rates in space and time. This results in low success rates, typically under 50%, especially when air temperatures are in the range 0–4°C. A more reliable approach incorporates additional factors such as station elevation, daily average humidity, and daily average wet-bulb temperature."}, {"question": "What is the significance of wet-bulb temperature in determining precipitation type, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "Wet-bulb temperature is significant because it approximates the temperature of precipitation more closely than air temperature. It is calculated as a function of air temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The formula for calculating wet-bulb temperature is provided in equation 4B1.1, which takes into account the cooling effect of evaporation on a parcel of air."}, {"question": "How does the algorithm developed by Ding et al. (2014) improve upon previous methods for partitioning precipitation type?", "answer": "The algorithm developed by Ding et al. (2014) improves upon previous methods by incorporating station elevation, daily average humidity, and daily average wet-bulb temperature. This approach had success rates between 53 and 66% when air temperatures were in the range 0–4°C, which is considerably better than methods based on air temperature alone. The algorithm's performance is attributed to its basis on a large and diverse dataset, making it a more reliable practical approach for partitioning precipitation type."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, why is accurate partitioning of rain/snow crucial, and what are the implications of inaccurate partitioning?", "answer": "Accurate partitioning of rain/snow is crucial because it significantly influences the success of snowmelt models. Inaccurate partitioning can lead to errors in predicting snowmelt and subsequent stream flow, which can have significant implications for water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecosystem health.

According to the study by Ding et al. (2014), the probability of sleet increases strongly as relative humidity increases. This relationship is likely due to the increased moisture availability at higher humidities, which can lead to the formation of sleet. The algorithm developed by Ding et al.

{"paragraph": "4.2.1.1 Types of Precipitation Gauges Conceptually, the measurement of precipitation at a point is straightforward: A rain gauge or precip- gauge  may  be  as  simple  as  a  vessel  open  to the air in which the collected water substance is peri- odically  measured  or  continuously  recorded.  The volume collected is divided by the area of the open- ing and recorded as the depth of precipitation.1 Basic  aspects  of  storage  and  recording  gauges are described here; details of construction and opera- Strangeways  (2007),  World  Meteorological  Organi- zation  (WMO  2008),  and  Habib  et  al.

Accumulated  water  volume  may  also  be measured by weighing or by decanting to a calibrated vessel. Nonrecording gauges are typically used to de- termine several hourly to daily precipitation totals. Conventional recording gauges also collect pre- cipitation in a vessel that must be periodically emp- tied,  with  the  accumulated  amounts  tracked  in various ways: • gauges  collect  precipitation  in  a  vessel Weighing on  a  scale  and  continuously  record  the  accumu- lated weight. Older versions record the weight as a continuous trace on a chart on a rotating drum or Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange periodically  (typically  every  15  minutes)  on  a punch-paper  tape;  newer  versions  use  direct  elec- tronic recording. Typical precision is 1 to 2.5 mm, but  vibrating  wire  weighing  devices  are  being  in- troduced that improve this to 0.25 mm. • Tipping-bucket gauges collect precipitation in one of a pair of small-capacity (typically 0.2 mm) ves- sels that are balanced on a fulcrum; when one ves- sel is filled, it tips and empties and records the time of  this  event  and  the  other  vessel  is  brought  into position for filling. • Float gauges collect precipitation in a vessel con- taining  a  float  that  is  connected  to  an  analog  or digital recording device. Precision depends on the float and recording mechanism. Frozen precipitation must be melted before mea- surement;  this  is  often  done  by  placing  a  charge  of antifreeze  in  the  collecting  vessel  or  by  heating  ele- ments.  Less  tractable  problems  arise  when  snow piles up at the gauge orifice and subsequently blows off  or,  as  will  be  discussed  more  fully  below,  when wind  eddies  prevent  significant  amounts  of  snow from entering the gauge. For these reasons, it is usu- ally preferable to measure the water content of snow by  means  other  than  standard  precipitation  gauges, as discussed in chapter 5.

{"paragraph": "4.2.1.2.5 Splash, Evaporation, and Wetting Losses If  the  surface  of  the  water  captured  in  a  rain gauge  is  too  near  the  orifice,  in-falling  drops  can cause  water  to  splash  out,  adding  to  the  catch  defi- ciency. This can  be  largely prevented  by using deep gauges or gauges with walls that are vertical or slope outward  below  the  orifice,  by  conducting  the  col- lected water to a covered vessel, and/or by emptying the gauge frequently (see Shaw 1988). For  ground-level  gauges  one  must  also  prevent in-splashing from drops falling near the gauge. This is done either by: (1) placing the gauge in a small ex- cavation so that its orifice is coincident with the gen- eral surface, but well above the immediately adjacent ground, (2) placing the gauge in a shallow excavation in  which  the  near-surface  soil  has  been  replaced  by the  soil  surface  within  several  meters  of  the  gauge with  a  mat  of  coarse  fiber  that  prevents  splashing (e.g., Neff 1977; Helvey and Patric 1983). For  small-orifice  gauges  and  all  nonrecording gauges that are read only at intervals of several days or more, one must prevent catch deficiencies due to evaporation from the water surface and the walls of the  gauge  (wetting  losses).

This form of observation error is especially im- portant  in  the  high  Arctic:  Traces  accounted  for 10%  of  the  summer  precipitation  on  average  in northern Alaska and could be as much as one-third of  the  total  in  some  years.  Brown  et  al.  (1968)  and Woo and Steer (1979) found similar results in north- ern Canada. Thus corrections for this effect have to be  made  in  assessing  the  region’s  water  balance; these  corrections  can  be  made  by  multiplying  the number  of  trace  observations  times  one-half  the maximum  amount  designated  as  a  “trace”  (i.e.,  by 0.0025  in  or  0.065  mm  in  the  United  States)  and adding the result to the recorded total precipitation (Dingman et al. 1980; see also Yang et al. 1998a and Yang et al. 2005). oitar hctaC Figure 4.22 Gauge-catch defi- ciencies for solid precipitation for selected countries [Adam and Lettenmaier (2003).

A  common  tech- nique  for  detecting  and  correcting  for  inconsistent precipitation data is via a double-mass curve, as de- scribed in box 4.2. Common  errors  in  historical  data  include  data gaps, impossible (e.g., negative) values, and unlikely high  or  low  values  (Habib  et  al.  2010).  Anomalous values can often be detected by periodically compar- ing the records from a number of gauges in a region and noting observations that do not conform to the overall  areal  pattern  of  precipitation.  If  a  particular Box 4.2 Double-Mass Curves A double-mass curve is a plot, on arithmetic graph paper, of the successive cumulative annuala precipitation collected at a gauge where measurement conditions may have changed significantly versus the successive cumulative average of the annual precipitation for the same period of years collected at several gauges in the same region that have not experienced such changes. The method attempts to detect a change in the propor- tionality between the measurements at the suspect sta- tion and those of the region, which is reflected in a change in the slope of the trend of the plotted points. Note that slope breaks in double-mass curves can occur because of climatic shifts; thus adjustments should only be made if there is reason to believe the break is due to a change in the measurement conditions. If a double-mass curve reveals a change in slope that is significant (see the following discussion) and is due to changed measurement conditions at a particular sta- tion, the annual values of the earlier portion of the record should be adjusted to be consistent with the later portion before computing regional averages and other statistics. This adjustment is accomplished simply by multiplying the data for the period before the slope change by the factor K, where slope for period AFTER slope change K . (4B2.1) slope for period BEFORRE slope change Most analysts recommend that a break in slope be considered significant only if it persists for five or more years, and then only if it: (1) is clearly associated with a change in measurement conditions and (2) is deter- mined to be statistically significant (Searcy and Hardi- son 1960). Statistical significance of slope changes in double- mass curves can be detected by techniques called anal- yses of variance and covariance. These techniques are described in most introductory statistical texts, and Chapter 4 Precipitation observation seems anomalously high, one can check weather  maps  to  see  if,  for  example,  small-scale thunderstorm  activity  was  occurring  during  the  pe- riod  of  interest.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  examine streamflow records for the region to see if high flows occurred. Probably the most effective quality-control strategy, and perhaps the most cost-effective, is to in- stall pairs of gauges at each measurement site (Habib et al. 2010). In the context of real-time flood forecasting, au- tomated quality-control methods are essential; often these  involve  comparison  of  gauge  measurements their application to double-mass curves was given by Searcy and Hardison (1960).b Chang and Lee (1974) described a computerized objective approach to dou- ble-mass curve analysis that incorporates analyses of variance and covariance. The following example illustrates the basic procedure. Table 4.4 shows the annual precipitation values for 1976 to 1992 at five gauges in a region. Gauge E was moved in 1981. To determine how the annual values for 1976– 1980 should be adjusted to be consistent with the subse- quent period of record, the cumulative annual values for station E are plotted against the cumulative values of the mean of the other four stations as a double-mass curve (figure 4.24 on p. 159). The slope of a straight line through the points prior to 1981 has a slope of 0.77 com- pared to a slope of 1.05 for a line through the points for succeeding years. The adjustment ratio K  is therefore Thus the annual precipitation values at station E before 1981 are multiplied by 1.36 to produce a consistent record for the entire period of measurement. The appro- priately adjusted values are given in the last column of table 4.4(A). The double-mass curve analysis is virtually always applied only to annual precipitation data. Data for shorter periods are naturally highly variable and tend to mask the kinds of mea- surement inconsistencies one is trying to identify. However, the usual statistical tests of significance for differ- ences in slope for regressions are not directly applicable for double-mass curves because the process of accumulation introduces a high degree of correlation between successive values. Because of this correlation, the conventional tests will often fail to detect statistically significant slope changes (see Matalas and Benson 1961).

A rigorous program of quality control helps to detect and correct inconsistencies in the data, ensuring a more reliable and consistent record. This is particularly important for making informed decisions in hydrology and water resources management."}, {"question": "How does a double-mass curve help in detecting and correcting inconsistent precipitation data?", "answer": "A double-mass curve is a plot of the successive cumulative annual precipitation collected at a gauge versus the successive cumulative average of the annual precipitation for the same period of years collected at several gauges in the same region. This technique helps to detect changes in the proportionality between the measurements at the suspect station and those of the region, which is reflected in a change in the slope of the trend of the plotted points. By analyzing the slope changes, one can identify and adjust for inconsistencies in the data, such as those caused by changes in measurement conditions."}, {"question": "In the context of real-time flood forecasting, what is the significance of automated quality-control methods?", "answer": "Automated quality-control methods are essential in real-time flood forecasting because they enable rapid detection and correction of errors in precipitation data. This is critical for making timely and accurate predictions of flood events, which can have significant impacts on public safety and infrastructure. Automated methods, such as comparing gauge measurements with radar and/or satellite observations, help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used in flood forecasting models."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the correlation between successive values when applying statistical tests to double-mass curves?", "answer": "The correlation between successive values in double-mass curves introduces a high degree of correlation, which can affect the results of statistical tests. Conventional tests may fail to detect statistically significant slope changes due to this correlation, making it essential to consider this factor when interpreting the results. This highlights the need for careful analysis and consideration of the underlying data and methods used in hydrological studies."}, {"question": "How can anomalous values in precipitation records be detected and verified?", "answer": "Anomalous values in precipitation records can be detected by periodically comparing the records from a number of gauges in a region and noting observations that do not conform to the overall areal pattern of precipitation. These values can be verified by checking weather maps to see if small-scale thunderstorm activity was occurring during the period of interest or by examining streamflow records for the region to see if high flows occurred. This approach helps to identify and correct errors in the data, ensuring a more accurate and reliable record."}, {"question": "In the context of precipitation data quality control, what is the benefit of installing pairs of gauges at each measurement site?", "answer": "Installing pairs of gauges at each measurement site is a cost-effective and effective quality-control strategy. This approach allows for the detection and correction of errors in real-time, enabling the collection of more accurate and reliable precipitation data. By comparing the measurements from the two gauges, any inconsistencies or anomalies can be identified and addressed, resulting in a higher quality dataset."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to adjust the annual values of the earlier portion of a precipitation record if a double-mass curve reveals a significant change in slope?", "answer": "Adjusting the annual values of the earlier portion of a precipitation record is necessary to ensure consistency with the later portion of the record. If a double-mass curve reveals a significant change in slope, it indicates a change in the proportionality between the measurements at the suspect station and those of the region. By adjusting the earlier values, the record can be made more consistent, allowing for more accurate analysis and comparison of the data. This adjustment is typically done by multiplying the data for the period before the slope change by a factor, such as the ratio of the slopes."}, {"question": "How do changes in measurement conditions, such as gauge relocation, affect precipitation data quality?", "answer": "Changes in measurement conditions, such as gauge relocation, can introduce errors and inconsistencies in precipitation data. These changes can affect the accuracy and reliability of the data, making it essential to detect and correct for such changes. Techniques like double-mass curves can help identify changes in measurement conditions, allowing for adjustments to be made to the data to ensure consistency and accuracy."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological analysis, what are the implications of using inconsistent or erroneous precipitation data?", "answer": "Using inconsistent or erroneous precipitation data can have significant implications for hydrological analysis, including inaccurate predictions of flood events, poor water resources management, and ineffective decision-making. Inconsistent data can lead to incorrect conclusions and recommendations, which can have far-reaching consequences for public safety, infrastructure, and the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the quality and accuracy of precipitation data through rigorous quality control and analysis."}]}

In  the  United  States the  undermeasurement  of  annual-average  precipita- tion at gauges averages 9%, and ranges from less than 6% where snow is absent to over 14% where snow is important  (figure  4.25)  (Groisman  and  Legates 1994).  However,  the  underestimation  varies  season- ally  and  from  year  to  year,  and  should  be  corrected on a monthly or daily basis. The implications of er- rors in precipitation data for water-balance computa- tions are discussed in section 1.11.2.4.

For snow, this is especially problematic due to its light and fluffy nature, which makes it more susceptible to being blown away from the gauge. As a result, measurements of snowfall can be significantly underestimated, leading to errors in the range of 5 to 15% for long-term data and as high as 75% for individual storms."}, {"question": "How do errors in precipitation data impact water-balance computations and hydrologic modeling?", "answer": "Errors in precipitation data can lead to faulty calibration and validation decisions and faulty predictions and forecasts in hydrologic models.

{"paragraph": "4.2.2 Radar Measurement Ground-based  radar  can  be  used  to  estimate  the areal distribution of instantaneous precipitation rates in clouds, and these rates can be electronically integrated to provide estimates of total precipitation for any time period. Energy in the wavelength band between 1 and 10  cm  (microwaves)  is  reflected  by  raindrops  and snowflakes  (collectively  called  hydrometeors).  The strength  of  the  signal  reflected  from  a  given  distance depends on the size distribution, number per unit vol- ume, state (liquid or solid), and shape of the hydrome- teors,  along  with  characteristics  of  the  radar  system, and the signal strength is related to precipitation inten- sity by empirical relations. Doppler radar systems also measure  the  horizontal  velocity  of  the  hydrometeors, and hence the movement of the storm. In  contrast  to  point  measurements,  ground- based radar systems provide spatially continuous es- timates  at small time  intervals. This  has revolution- ized  quantitative  rainfall  estimation  globally,  and radar is the primary observing system in many coun- tries (Seo et al. 2010).

{"paragraph": "4.2.3 Satellite Measurement Satellites obtain information about the distribu- tion and amounts of precipitation via both direct and indirect means (Arkin and Ardanuy 1989; Kidd et al. 2010). Direct observation is by passive and active (ra- dar)  sensing  of  microwave  (MW)  energy  absorbed and  scattered  by  hydrometeors;  conversion  of  these observations  into  estimates  of  rainfall  rates  is  done by accounting for the background radiation from the earth’s  surface  and  making  assumptions  about  the size distribution of the hydrometeors. Indirect obser- vation  is  by  sensing  visible  (VIS)  and  infrared  (IR) radiation emitted by clouds, converting the radiation flux  to  cloud-top  temperature  via  the  Stefan– Chapter 4 Precipitation Boltzmann  law  [equation  (2.1)],  and  making  use  of empirical  correlations  between  the  spatial  and  tem- poral coverage of clouds with temperatures below a threshold value and rainfall. Currently, geostationary satellites using infrared observations provide rainfall data  every  30  minutes,  and  passive-microwave  sen- sors provide data at < 3-hr intervals at a spatial reso- 25 km) (Kidd et al. 2010). Major programs have been instituted to refine sat- ellite estimates of precipitation, including the Global Precipitation  Climatology  Project  (GPCP),  which collects and synthesizes information from polar-orbit- ing and geostationary satellites and surface stations; a series  of  NOAA  polar-orbiting  satellites  with  an  ad- vanced  microwave  sounding  unit  (AMSU);  and  the NASA  Earth  Observing  System  (EOS).  NASA’s Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission  (TRMM)  is  a low-orbiting satellite that includes precipitation radar as well as passive sensing of visible, infrared, and mi- crowave radiation. These capabilities will be extended to  cover  the  earth  between  the  Arctic  and  Antarctic circles  in  NASA’s  Global  Precipitation  Mission, scheduled to launch in early 2014. Several  recent  studies  have  evaluated  satellite- precipitation  estimation  in  various  contexts.  DiTo- maso et al. (2009) developed a procedure to estimate precipitation  using  different  frequencies  of  the  US AMSU-B satellite, and found “very good agreement” with  ground-based  gauge  and  radar  measurements. Tian et al. (2009) evaluated six satellite-precipitation data sets versus rain-gauge data in the United States. They found that satellites did well at detecting rain- falls > 40 mm/d, but had substantial biases, includ- ing  missed  precipitation  (especially  rainfall  <  10 mm/d),  up  to  50%  overestimation  in  summer  and underestimation  in  winter,  and  very  little  ability  to measure  snowfall.  Tian  and  Peters-Lidard  (2010) evaluated  six  TRMM  data  sets  at  0.25°  as  well  as daily  resolution  and  reported  uncertainties  of  40  to 60%  over  oceans  and  100  to  140%  at  high  latitudes and over complex topography and coastlines. Uncer- tainties were highest in winter and with light precipi- tation.  AghaKouchak  et  al.  (2011)  found  serious shortcomings in the ability of four satellite-based pre- cipitation products to capture precipitation extremes, which are critical for flood forecasting. New methods for removal of bias from merged rain-gauge and sat- ellite  rainfall  estimates  were  described  by  Li  and Shao  (2010)  in  Australia,  Xie  and  Xiong  (2011)  in China, and Lin and Wang (2011) in Canada. Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange The  utility  of  satellite-based  precipitation  esti- mates as inputs to hydrologic models is an important question. Yong et al. (2010) found that one TRMM precipitation-estimation  product  provided  realistic hydrologic  predictions,  but  another  had  almost  no utility,  and  suggested  corrections  for  future  IR  esti- mates. Pan et al. (2010) used satellite MW and MW + IR and ground-based precipitation data sets as in- puts to a hydrologic model to compare predictions of soil  moisture,  evapotranspiration,  and  streamflow over the continental United States. They found that integrating  rain-gauge  data  significantly  improved predictions, and that rainfall-estimation errors have a large effect on estimates of soil moisture and stream- flow, but only weak effect on evapotranspiration. In a  similar  study  in  Illinois,  Behrangi  et  al.  (2011) found that 6-hr and monthly streamflow predictions based  on  five  satellite-based  precipitation  products were  useful  if  biases  toward  overestimation  in  sum- mer and underestimation in winter were corrected. Considerable progress is being made in correct- ing for inherent biases in satellite-based precipitation data, and satellites will have an extremely important and  growing  role  in  assessing  global  precipitation. The  earth’s  surface  is  70%  ocean  and  much  of  the land surface is virtually uninhabited, so that the per- centage of the earth’s surface on which precipitation- gauge measurements are available is very small and gauge  densities  are  generally  very  sparse.  Thus  it  is only with the advent of satellites that scientists have been able to obtain a global perspective on precipita- tion  and  other  aspects  of  the  hydrologic  cycle,  and satellite-based  information  will  play  an  increasing role  in  providing  precipitation  data  for  hydrologic science and applications.

{"paragraph": "4.3 Areal Estimation from Point Measurements Hydrologists are almost always interested in pre- cipitation  over  a  region  rather  than  at  a  point.  The long-term  average  precipitation  over  a  watershed, lake,  or  ground-water  recharge  area  is  the  input  to water-balance computations (section 1.8.1); the total precipitation over a watershed for a particular storm is  the  input  for  analyses  of  hydrologic  response (chapter 10). As we have just seen, radar and satellite measurements  provide  valuable  information  about areal  precipitation  extent  and  are  increasingly  used along with gauge measurements to develop informa- tion  on  spatial  distribution.  However,  rain  gauges usually provide the most accurate measurements and are often the only sources of historical information, so methods that derive spatial-distribution estimates using  only  gauge  measurements  remain  essential tools.  Furthermore,  the  methods  are  applicable  to other types of hydrologically important point obser- vations, such as soil moisture and aquifer properties. Conceptually,  the  spatial  average  precipitation, P, over the region depicted in figure 4.26 is P p (x, y) dx dy, where  A  is  the  area  of  the  region,  (x,y)  are  coordi- nates  of  points  in  A,  and  p(x,y)  is  the  precipitation (average  or  total  over  a  time  period)  at  point  (x,y). Measurements of precipitation have been made at G are  designated    p(x ,y ).  This  section  introduces approaches to estimating areal averages and distribu- tion from point measurements and assessing the un- certainty of such estimates. Note that the values at each gauge may be a sin- gle observation (e.g., rainfall in a single storm) or a climatological  statistic,  in  which  the  values  at  each point are calculated from time series [e.g., the long- term  average  annual  precipitation  (section  4.4.1)  or an extreme rainfall quantity (section 4.4.3)]. If a cli- matologic  statistic,  estimations  of  uncertainty  must account  for  temporal  as  well  as  spatial  uncertainty, as described in section 4.3.5. Approaches  to  computing  an  estimate  of  P,  , can be divided into two classes: 1. Methods  that  compute    directly  as  a  weighted average of the measured values; and 2. Surface-fitting  methods  that  first  use  the  mea- sured values to estimate the precipitation at regu- larly  spaced  grid-points  in  A,  and  then  compute the  average  of  these  values.

Once  the  estimates  are surface-fitting made at all grid points, the spatial average [equation (4.3)] can be estimated as = (4.16) where I is the number of grid points in A. All  interpolation  methods  are  based  on  the  as- sumptions that the surface being modeled is continu- ous (no gaps or breaks) and has a single value at each coordinate point, and that the precipitation at an ar- bitrary grid point has some relationship to the mea- sured  values;  this  relationship  is  modeled  by  the interpolation  function.

This approach can be particularly useful in areas with heterogeneous landscapes or complex hydrological processes."}, {"question": "How does the weighted sum of cone contributions in the multiquadric interpolation method account for the uncertainty associated with gauge observations?", "answer": "The paragraph does not provide explicit information on how the weighted sum of cone contributions accounts for uncertainty associated with gauge observations. However, the use of a weighted sum suggests that the method may be able to incorporate some form of uncertainty or error estimation, potentially through the assignment of weights based on the reliability or accuracy of each gauge observation.

{"paragraph": "4.3.2.6 Geostatistical Methods Geostatistics  is  a  general  term  for  a  group  of statistical  methods  in  which  the  interpolation  func- tion equation (4.15) takes the form where  the  weights    are  determined  by  applying statistical criteria (unbiasedness and minimization of estimation  error)  and  are  dependent  on  the correlation, i.e., the degree of similarity of precipita- Box 4.3 Spatial Correlation The general statistical concept of correlation is dis- cussed in section C.6 of appendix C. Here we apply the concept to assess the similarity of precipitation mea- surements made at various distances from each other. Consider a region in which we have G gauges at which precipitation has been measured for T years. At each gauge, we can measure the total precipitation for each year, p , and compute the average annual precipi- tation, m , and the standard deviation of the annual precipitation, s , as s (p m . (4B3.2) pg gt pg (See box C.2 on the disk accompanying the text.) There are a total of G(G – 1)/2 pairs of gauges. For each pair, say the two gauges g = a and g = b, the corre- lation between annual values r  is (p m ) ◊(p m ) at pa bt pb (T 1) s s (See box C.6 on the disk.) If |r | exceeds a critical value r* that depends on T [equation (CB6.2)], we conclude that there is a significant linear relation between annual values of precipitation at tion values at two points as a function of the distance between them (box 4.3). If the average and the variance of the precipita- tion  are  not  functions  of  location,  the  precipitation process is second-order stationary, and we have for all points in A where E{.} denotes the expected value (i.e., the aver- age) and σ2 is the overall spatial variance of precipi- The core concept of geostatistics is that, on aver- age,  the  difference  in  precipitation  at  points  sepa- points a and b: Positive values of r  indicate a tendency for a given year to have relatively high or relatively low values of precipitation at both gauges, and negative val- ues indicate a tendency for precipitation at both gauges to vary in opposite ways (a low year at one gauge tends to be a high year at the other, and vice versa). When r  has been calculated for all pairs of gauges, the values accepted as significant can be plotted against the distance between each pair, d , which is given by a,b a b a b gauges a and b, respectively. Figure 4.38 shows an r  versus d  plot for 29 precipi- tation gauges (406 gauge pairs) in Nebraska and Kansas. As is common for such plots, it shows considerable scat- ter. However, in order to use the optimal interpolation methods described in the text, the relation between r and d  has to be described as a simple function. Tabios and Salas (1985) suggested the following alternative functional forms: where c is a parameter to be determined from the data. Figure 4.38 shows equation (4B3.5c) with c = 0.0031 km–1 fit to the data of Tabios and Salas (1985). (See box 4.5.) rated  by  a  distance  d  increases  as  d  increases.  The variogram,5 relationship  can  be  quantified  in  the γ(d), which depicts the average squared difference in precipitation as a function of d: Alternatively,  the  spatial  relation  can  be  ex- pressed  as  the  coefficient, spatial-correlation which is given by ∫ . (4.25) Note that ρ(d) and γ(d) are related as g = 0.5 1 - . The variogram is a dimensional quantity that increases with separation, the spatial- correlation coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that decreases with separation. The  most  widely  used  version  of  geostatistics, called kriging,6 is based on the variogram, so the dis- cussion here will focus on that approach. The meth- ods  called  interpolation  and optimal  empirical orthogonal functions, which are similar approaches that use spatial correlation, are described in Creutin and Obled (1982). In practice, the statistics must be estimated from the  sample  of  measured  precipitation  values.  The mean and variance are estimated by standard statisti- cal formulas (appendix C): and the variogram as (d ) = + - , p u d p u where    represents  a  gauge  location  and    is  the number of gauges separated by d. is called the experimental variogram. For and hence that number of d values. In general these Chapter 4 Precipitation values will all be different, so the number G  is deter- mined by “binning” in intervals of Δd, i.e., G Δd/2), and the p(u + d) and p(u ) values in equation (4.29)  are  replaced  by  averages  for  the  pairs  of  sta- tions included in each bin. Typically, gˆ when d = 0, it increases with d,  and  levels  off  at  some  distance  d  =  D,  which  is called the range. Note that this typical variogram re- lation will only be evident if: 1. There is an underlying relation between precipita- tion and separation; 2. Precipitation is not significantly affected by factors other than separation, such as elevation or distance from the coast (this is discussed further below); 3. Measurements  errors  are  reasonably  small  (sec- tion 4.2.1.2); and 4. The average spacing of gauges is small enough to reveal the relation. In  kriging,  the  interpolation  function  is  deter- mined by a model, or theoretical, variogram that is selected based on the form of the experimental vario- gram, and is a model of the spatial-covariance struc- ture of the data. Only certain functional forms satisfy the  mathematical  requirements  for  an  interpolation of the most commonly used are illustrated in figure 4.30.

The weights in the interpolation function are determined by the theoretical variogram, ensuring unbiased estimates that minimize error variance and incorporate the spatial structure of the process."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the spatial correlation between precipitation measurements at different gauges in geostatistical analysis?", "answer": "Considering spatial correlation is crucial because it allows for the assessment of the similarity of precipitation measurements made at various distances from each other. This similarity, quantified through the correlation coefficient, is essential for determining the weights in the interpolation function and for understanding how precipitation values are related across different locations. By analyzing the spatial correlation, researchers can identify patterns and trends in precipitation data that would be missed by considering each gauge in isolation."}, {"question": "In the context of kriging, what is the role of the experimental variogram, and how is it related to the theoretical variogram?", "answer": "The experimental variogram is an estimate of the variogram based on the sample of measured precipitation values. It is used to select a theoretical variogram that best models the spatial covariance structure of the data. The theoretical variogram is then used to determine the weights in the interpolation function. The relationship between the experimental and theoretical variograms is critical because it allows for the estimation of the interpolation error variance at each grid point, providing a measure of uncertainty in the predictions."}, {"question": "How does the incorporation of elevation or other factors influencing precipitation variability affect the geostatistical analysis?", "answer": "When elevation or other factors significantly influence precipitation variability, the basic geostatistical model [equation (4.22)] no longer holds. To address this, the dependence on location (drift) can be modeled, for example, as a function of elevation, and this relation can be incorporated into the derivation of the weights. Alternatively, the effect of elevation or other factors can be subtracted from precipitation to define a new spatial variable, which is then analyzed geostatistically. This adjustment is crucial for accurately capturing the spatial variability of precipitation in regions with significant orographic influences."}, {"question": "What are the critical properties of the weights derived via kriging, and why are they important for precipitation estimation?", "answer": "The critical properties of the weights derived via kriging are that they provide unbiased estimates, minimize the error variance, incorporate the spatial structure of the process as modeled in the theoretical semivariogram, and allow for the estimation of the error variance at each point. These properties are important because they ensure that the precipitation estimates are not only accurate but also that the uncertainty associated with these estimates can be quantified. This is particularly valuable in hydrological applications where understanding the uncertainty of precipitation estimates is crucial for decision-making and risk assessment."}, {"question": "In the context of geostatistical analysis, why is it necessary to bin the data into intervals of Δd when estimating the experimental variogram?", "answer": "Binning the data into intervals of Δd is necessary because the number of gauge pairs separated by a specific distance d can vary significantly, leading to different numbers of data points for each distance. By binning the data, the experimental variogram can be estimated more robustly, as it averages out the variability in the number of data points across different distances, providing a more stable and reliable estimate of the variogram."}, {"question": "How does the spatial-correlation coefficient relate to the variogram, and what are the implications of this relationship for geostatistical analysis?", "answer": "The spatial-correlation coefficient (ρ) and the variogram (γ) are related as γ = σ^2 * (1 - ρ), where σ^2 is the variance. This relationship is fundamental because it connects the dimensionless spatial-correlation coefficient, which decreases with separation, with the dimensional variogram, which increases with separation. Understanding this relationship is crucial for geostatistical analysis as it allows for the conversion between these two measures of spatial dependence, facilitating the selection of appropriate models for the variogram and the interpretation of the results in terms of both correlation and variogram characteristics."}, {"question": "Why is the range (D) of the variogram an important parameter in geostatistical analysis, and how is it determined?", "answer": "The range (D) of the variogram is an important parameter because it represents"}]}
{"paragraph": "4.3.2.7 The PRISM Model PRISM (Precipitation-Elevation Regressions on Independent  Slopes  Model)  is  an  analytical  model that computes estimates of monthly, annual, or sin- gle-storm precipitation. The model first uses a DEM to generate a smoothed version of the actual topogra- phy (the “orographic elevations”), then a windowing technique  to  group  precipitation  gauges  onto  topo- graphic facets.

{"paragraph": "4.3.3 Comparison of Methods and Summary Comparative studies of subsets of the areal-esti- mation methods described above have been made by vaerts (2000). The choice of a method for computing areal pre- cipitation  depends  on  several  factors,  including:  (1) the objective of the analysis; (2) the nature of the re- gion;  and  (3)  the  time  and  computing  resources available. When only areal averages are needed and time  and  resources  are  limited,  or  only  reconnais- sance-level estimates are required, one would usually apply one of the direct-weighted-average methods or the  hypsometric  method.

Otherwise,  the  hypsometric  or surface-fitting methods can be used. However,  most  of  the  comparative  studies  re- viewed above have concluded that optimal-interpola- tion/kriging  methods  provide  the  best  estimates  of regional  precipitation  in  a  variety  of  situations.  Pre- sumably  this  is  because  these  methods  are  based  on the spatial correlation structure of precipitation in the region  of  application  rather  than  on  essentially  arbi- trary spatial structures. A number of inexpensive opti- mal interpolation/kriging programs are now available (e.g., Grundy 1988; Kitanidis 1992) so that the feasi- bility of using these approaches is much enhanced. The  geostatistical  methods  have  the  additional advantages of providing explicit estimates of interpo- lation  error  along  with  a  model  of  the  spatial  vari- ability.  However,  uncertainty  for  deterministic  as well  as  statistical  methods  can  be  assessed  by validation,  in  which  the  predictive  model  is  devel- oped using a subset of the available measured data, and  tested  by  comparing  the  model  predictions against the values not used in the development.

{"paragraph": "4.3.5 Uncertainty Analysis of Gauge Networks The  importance  and  basic  aspects  of  assessing uncertainty in hydrology were introduced in section 1.11. Recall that all measurements contain random er- rors,  which  are  unavoidable,  unpredictable  fluctua- tions  in  values  obtained  in  a  given  measurement situation that are equally likely to be greater than or less  than  the  true  value;  these  are  reflected  in  the measurement precision. Many types of measurements are also subject to systematic errors, which are biases due  to  inherent  tendencies  for  instrumentation  or methods of observation to consistently record values that  are  on  average  higher  or  lower  than  the  “true” values.  Errors  are  particularly  critical  concerns  for precipitation, which is the input to the land phase of the hydrologic cycle. As noted in section 4.2.1, there are many causes of (mostly negative) bias in measurements at individ- ual rain gauges. In addition, spatial averages derived from any irregularly distributed station network con- tain  biases  due  to  unavoidable  errors  in  any  of  the spatial-interpolation  methods  discussed  in  section 4.3.2. These biases are usually difficult to assess, and may be especially large when the overall gauge den- sity  is  insufficient  to  resolve  the  actual  spatial  vari- ability.  This  is  illustrated  in  figure  4.33  on  p.  176, which  compares  1985  precipitation  in  North  Caro- lina based on the first-order network and the cooper- ative network. Figure 4.33 illustrates that the density of  a  precipitation-gauge  network  can  make  a  large difference in estimates of areal precipitation: The dif- ferences exceed 762 mm in the mountainous regions, and are over 254 mm even in the relatively flat pied- mont portions of the state. In one of the few studies Box 4.4 Global and US Precipitation-Gauge Networks Maps of station locations, climatological maps, and station-specific precipitation and other climate data are available for the world through the National Climatic Data Center of the NOAA (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ oa/climate/climatedata.html). The table below includes a brief list of the major systems/networks around the globe and in the United States. WMO Networks The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that there are some 200,000 surface weather sta- tions on land, a gauge density of about 1.5×10–3/km2 (700 km2/gauge).

(1994)  found  that  sparse densities introduced large positive bias for all conti- nents  except  South  America,  where  the  bias  was strongly  negative;  however,  they  found  that  long- term  continental  averages  could  be  reasonably  as- 106  km2 sessed  with  densities  of  5  to  20  gauges  per (5×104 to 2×105 km2/gauge). In contrast, the effect of the density and spacing of gauges on the precision of areal rainfall estimates has  been  widely  investigated.  Recall  from  section 1.11.2 that precision is expressed as a confidence in- terval about the estimate, which is a multiple k(p) of the  estimate  (also  called  the standard  deviation  of  the standard error of estimate), s : \"I am p % sure that k P k ,\" - s £ £ + s Where p or p is selected by the investigator and k(p) is  determined  by  properties  of  the  normal  distribu- Chapter 4 Precipitation value of s  is determined by applying basic statisti- cal  theory  to  repeated  measurements.  Clearly,  the value  of  is  inversely  related  to  precision  and  to the information content of the estimated mean. An  early  study  by  Huff  (1970)  explored  the  ef- fects  of  gauge  density  on  the  standard  error  of  esti- mate  of  average  areal  rainfall  using  a  dense,  evenly distributed gauge network on a flat prairie area in Illi- nois. His results are summarized in terms of average absolute  (standard  error  in  mm)  and  relative  (stan- dard error in percent) error in figure 4.34 (on p. 177): On average, absolute error increased and  relative er- ror  decreased  with  total  precipitation,  while  both types  of  error  decreased  with  storm  duration  and gauge density. He also found that a given sampling er- ror could be achieved with a much smaller gauge den- sity  when  calculating  monthly,  seasonal,  or  annual rainfall than for the shorter durations represented in figure  4.34.  These  general  trends  have  been  widely observed, but of course the quantitative relationships differ greatly with location—and in fact Huff  (1970) reported large variability from storm to storm, more areal  variability  for  summer  convective  storms  than for  winter  storms,  and  a  difference  in  the  relation- ships between the two 5-yr time periods he observed. Here we describe the general approach to assess- ing  random  uncertainty  in  areal  average  precipita- tion  estimates  developed  by  Rodriguez-Iturbe  and Mejia  (1974)  (see  also  Bras  and  Rodriguez-Iturbe 1984). The precision of a rain-gauge network can be improved by (1) increasing the density of the gauge network  and  (2)  extending  the  period  of  measure- ment; the trade-off between the increase in informa- tion and gauge density or time takes the form shown in  figure  4.35  on  p.  178.  Note  that  the  rate  of  in- crease  of  precision  decreases  as  gauge  density  and observation time increase. As noted in box 1.1 [equation (1B1.1)], statisti- cal theory shows that the standard error of estimate of an average value decreases with the number of in- dependent observations, N, as is the standard deviation of the N individ- ual observations. Independence here means that, for a given time period, measurements at one gauge are not systematically related to those at another gauge (spatial  independence);  and  that  for  a  given  gauge, observations  in  one  time  period  are  not  systemati- Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Figure 4.33 Annual precipitation in North Carolina in 1985 based on (a) the primary network and (b) the cooperative network.

Thus  for  spatially  and  temporally independent observations, the curve in figure 4.35 is given  by  the  inverse  square  root  of  the  number  of gauges, G, and the number of observation periods, T. However,  as  we  saw  in  section  4.3.2.6,  there  is typically  a  relationship  between  measurements  at gauges spaced a distance d apart, which is quantified tial-correlation  coefficient  [equation  (4.25)].  If the average spatial correlation is high,7 the informa- tion provided by the G gauges is less than would be provided by G independent gauges [ρ(d) = 0]. Thus the curve in figure 4.35 will decline less steeply than the inverse square root. Similarly, if precipitation values in one time pe- riod are systematically related to those in the follow- ing  time  period,  the  standard  error  will  decline  less rapidly than T –1/2. To describe this situation, we use the  analogous  concept  of  autocorrelation  (persis- tence),8 ρ itation  separated  by  one  time  unit,  called  the autocorrelation coefficient.9 To formulate a general relation that accounts for the effects of spatial and temporal dependence on the standard error of estimates of areal average precipita- tion, Rodriguez-Iturbe and Mejia (1974) wrote where    is  the  aggregate  variance  of  the  annual precipitation measurements at all gauges in a region over  the  period  of  record;  (T)  is  a temporal vari- function  that  depends  on  the  num- ance-reduction ber of years of observation, T, and the average value of the autocorrelation coefficient for all gauges; and (G)  is  a  function  that spatial  variance-reduction depends on the number of gauges, G, the spatial cor- relation  of  precipitation,  the  shape  of  the  area,  and the spatial distribution of the gauges. To illustrate the approach,  we  assume  a  random  distribution  of gauges  in  a  square  area;  Morrissey  et  al.  (1995)  ex- plore the effects of other network configurations. Figure  4.36  shows  how  (T)  decreases  with for  various  values  of  (1).  These  curves  are  calcu- lated from equation (C.51) for the standard error of the  mean  (=  square  root  of  the  error  variance),  ac- counting  for  the  effect  of  autocorrelation  on  the  ef- fective  record  length  [equation  (C.68)  with replaced by T], so that the variance reduction is less (1) increases for a given T. In order to evaluate F (G), we need to model the dependence  of  spatial  correlation  on  separation,  d. This  can  be  done  as  described  for  the  experimental variogram  in  section  4.3.2.6:  first  the  experimental autocorrelation  relation is  developed,  then  a model relating ρ(d) to d is fit to the experimental val- ues. A common model is where c is the decay constant [L–1] that best fits the data.  With  this  model,  Rodriguez-Iturbe  and  Mejia (1974) developed the relation between F (G) and the dimensionless variable A · c2, where A is the area of the region (figure 4.37). Box 4.5 on p. 180 applies the approach of Rodri- guez-Iturbe and Mejia (1974) to a region in the central United States. The important implication of equation (4.38) and figures 4.33, 4.34, and 4.37 is that we can increase the precision of areal precipitation measure- ments by either: (1) increasing the period of observa- G, and box 4.5 illustrates an important conclusion: We can trade time versus space in hydrologic data collection when we do not reduce the time interval too much, but no miracles can be expected in short times even from the most dense of all possible net- works.

Chapter 4 Precipitation Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Box 4.5 Example Application of Information Analysis of a Precipitation-Gauge Network For the region of eastern Nebraska and northern Kan- mean annual precipitation for a 30-yr period was deter- mined at 29 stations. The overall mean value (mean of the means at all stations)   = 619 mm/yr, and the overall = 25,445 mm2/yr2. The autocorrelation variance coefficient for annual rainfall [equation (4.37)] was not significantly different from 0, so we assume that ρ (1) = 0. Spatial correlation was calculated as described in box 4.3. The values are plotted in figure 4.38 as a function of gauge separation; although there is much scatter, the spatial correlation can be modeled via equation (4.39) with c = 0.0031 km–1. To calculate the standard error of estimate in the areal average 30-yr mean precipitation, we find from fig- find F (29) = 0.73. Thus, we calculate the standard error of estimate of average annual precipitation for this situa- tion via equation (4.38) as ◊25,445 mm2 /yr2 0.033 0.73 24.8 25 mm/yr. Following the discussion in section 1.11.2.3 and equation (4.35), we can thus state: “I am 95% sure that the average annual precipitation is between We can also compare the value, in terms of variance reduction, of additional years of record with the value of additional gauges in this situation. To do this, we read values of F (T) as a function of T directly from the ρ (1) = 0 curve in figure 4.36; these are plotted in figure 4.39. Then entering figure 4.37 at a value of A · c = 0.50, we on figure 4.39. Comparing the two curves in figure 4.39, we see that an additional year of record is generally much more valuable in reducing uncertainty (increasing information) than an additional gauge. In fact, for esti- mating mean annual precipitation, there is little to be gained by having more than about 20 gauges in the region, and additional years of record beyond the pres- ent 30 add variance reduction only very slowly. However, we cannot conclude from this example that there is no need for more precipitation data collection in this region: the analysis applies only to mean annual precipitation, and we are also interested in values for other time periods and for hydrologic analysis of future storms and drought periods. Also, the analysis only applies for a situation in which climate is not changing, and we are interested in maintaining measurements to detect such change.

Additionally, the analysis assumes a stationary climate, which may not be the case in reality. To address these challenges, hydrologists can use techniques such as trend analysis and change detection to identify shifts in precipitation patterns, and can incorporate additional data sources, such as satellite imagery and climate models, to improve the accuracy of their estimates."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the spatial correlation of precipitation when designing a precipitation-gauge network, and how can this correlation be modeled?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the spatial correlation of precipitation when designing a precipitation-gauge network because it affects the accuracy of areal precipitation estimates.

{"paragraph": "4.4 Precipitation Climatology As discussed in chapters 1 and 2, long-term aver- age precipitation and its characteristic seasonal vari- ability  are  fundamental  determinants  of  regional hydrology,  soils,  and  vegetation.  In  addition,  esti- mates of regional extreme values of precipitation are required  for  the  prediction  of  flood  magnitudes  re- quired  for  designing  structures  such  as  culverts, bridges, storm sewers, and dams, and for delineating areas subject to flooding. This section describes how these climatological averages and extreme values are developed  at  individual  precipitation-gauge  stations and how these values are related to general meteoro- logical conditions. As noted in section 1.9.2.3, climatological com- putations  are  traditionally  based  on  the  implicit  as- sumption that time series are stationary, i.e., that the underlying processes generating precipitation are un- changing and historical measurements are represen- tative  of  future  behavior.  If  stationarity  can  be assumed, the computation of averages and other sta- tistics  from  past  data  are  meaningful,  and  it  can  be assumed  that  increasing  sample  size  (i.e.,  length  of observation  period)  decreases  uncertainty  indefi- nitely, as in standard statistical theory.

This challenge implies that traditional methods may not accurately predict future hydrological conditions, and new approaches are needed to account for the changing climate.

However, this approach does not fundamentally address the issue of nonstationarity, as it still relies on the assumption that recent past conditions will continue into the near future, which may not hold true in a changing climate. The effectiveness of this approach in capturing nonstationarity depends on the rate and magnitude of climate change and how well the updated data reflect these changes."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological structure design, why are estimates of extreme precipitation values necessary?", "answer": "Estimates of extreme precipitation values are necessary for the design of structures such as culverts, bridges, storm sewers, and dams to predict flood magnitudes accurately. This is crucial because these structures must be able to withstand extreme flood events to prevent failures that could have significant economic and environmental impacts. The accuracy of these estimates directly affects the safety and efficacy of hydrological infrastructure."}, {"question": "What is the implication of assuming stationarity in time series for hydrological predictions?", "answer": "Assuming stationarity in time series implies that the underlying processes generating precipitation are unchanging, and historical measurements are representative of future behavior. This assumption allows for the computation of averages and other statistics from past data to predict future hydrological conditions. However, given the changing global climate, this assumption may lead to inaccurate predictions, as it does not account for potential shifts in precipitation patterns and extremes over time."}, {"question": "How does the recognition of nonstationarity in precipitation time series affect the interpretation of historical hydrological data?", "answer": "The recognition of nonstationarity in precipitation time series affects the interpretation of historical hydrological data by suggesting that these data may not be fully representative of future conditions. This challenges the traditional approach of relying solely on historical records to predict future hydrological events, such as floods, and underscores the need for methods that can account for changes in precipitation patterns over time. It implies that historical data should be used with caution and in conjunction with other approaches that consider the potential impacts of climate change on hydrological systems."}, {"question": "In the context of flood prediction, why are regional extreme values of precipitation important?", "answer": "Regional extreme values of precipitation are important for flood prediction because they are used to estimate flood magnitudes, which are crucial for designing hydrological structures"}]}

Its influence is evident in the roughly concentric pattern of isohyets extending northward from the Gulf Coast and westward, indicating the pathway of moisture-rich air masses that contribute to precipitation in these regions. This pattern underscores the significant role of the Gulf in shaping precipitation patterns, especially in the eastern and central parts of the United States."}, {"question": "What role does the Atlantic Ocean play as a moisture source for precipitation in the United States, and why is its effect limited to the immediate coastal area?", "answer": "The Atlantic Ocean serves as a moisture source for precipitation, but its effect is limited to the immediate coastal area because the prevailing storm movements are from the west. This means that the Atlantic's moisture contribution is primarily felt in coastal regions, with less influence on the broader continental precipitation patterns due to the dominant westerly flow of air masses."}, {"question": "In the region between longitude 105°W and the mountains of California and western Washington and Oregon, what factors contribute to the irregular isohyetal patterns and low average precipitation values?", "answer": "The irregular isohyetal patterns in this region are due to the influence of orography in the Rockies and other mountains, as well as the importance of local convective storms. The low average precipitation values are primarily a result of the rain-shadow effects of the West Coast mountains, which block moisture-laden air from the Pacific, and the distance from the Gulf of Mexico, a significant moisture source. These factors combine to create a complex precipitation pattern characterized by low averages and significant variability."}, {"question": "How does the calculation of long-term average precipitation account for biases due to wind and other factors?", "answer": "The calculation of long-term average precipitation accounts for biases due to wind and other factors by correcting the measured precipitation data for these influences, as discussed in section 4.2.1.

The January maximum of precipi- tation on the West Coast is associated with the posi- tion and intensity of the North Pacific high-pressure cell and the Aleutian low-pressure cell (figure 2.12a), which  produces  an  eastward  flow  of  moisture-laden air in winter. In the summer (figure 2.12b), the high- pressure cell has expanded, leading to subsidence and a northerly wind flow parallel to the coast.

By July this zone has migrated farther north with the Arctic front (Barry and Chorley 1982). The August maximum in the tropics is due to the northward migration of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California, increased  thermal-convective  thunderstorm  activity, and,  in  the  Southeast,  rain  from  tropical  cyclones. The  mild  August  Arctic  maximum  results  from  the northward  position  of  cyclogenesis  associated  with the Arctic front and the increased amount of moisture that can be held in the warmer air of late summer.

To determine the PMF, a design rainfall called precipitation  (PMP)  is  esti- probable  maximum mated,  which  is  used  as  input  to  a  hydrological model to predict the resulting flood flow. The PMP is “theoretically the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a given size storm area at a particular geographical location at a certain time of year” (Hansen 1987). Although the PMP concept uses the word “prob- able,”  it  is  based  on  the  deterministic  premise  that there is a theoretical maximum to rainfall generation that is meteorologically possible in a given region. In practice, PMP estimates are developed by estimating the  maximum  values  of  (1)  precipitable  water,  (2) vertical uplift rates, and (3) convergence of moisture- laden air (see section 3.4), guided by analysis of the largest recorded rainfalls in the region (WMO 1986b; Smith  1992;  Papalexiou  and  Koutsoyiannis  2006; Casas et al. 2008).

Data are listed in table 4.9. The  storm  size  and  duration  appropriate  for  a given  situation  are  determined  by  the  size  of  the drainage  basin  of  interest:  In  general,  the  critical storm  size  is  approximately  equal  to  the  basin  size, and  the  critical  duration  is  approximately  equal  to the “time of concentration” of the basin (the time it takes  storm  runoff  to  travel  from  the  most  distant part of the drainage basin to the outlet; discussed in chapter 10). As a general guide, figure 4.44 gives ap- proximate  relationships  between  time  of  concentra- tion and drainage area. Schreiner  and  Reidel  (1978)  developed  general- ized PMP maps for portions of the United States east of  the  105th meridian,  where orographic effects are negligible. Maps were given for storms of 4, 12, 24, 48,  and  72  hours  in  duration  and  areas  of  10,  200, 52,000 km2). 13,000,  26,000,  and  Figure  4.45  on  p. 191 shows three of these maps; Schreiner and Reidel (1978)  gave  methods  for  developing  PMP  estimates for  durations  and  areas  other  than  those  mapped. The National Academy of Sciences (1983) identified sources  for  estimating  PMP  for  regions  west  of  the 105th meridian, and Hansen et al. (1982) and Han- sen  (1987)  gave  detailed  instructions  for  developing the  storm,  which  incorporates probable  maximum estimates of the timing and areal distribution of rain- fall for use in hydrologic models.

The concepts of PMP and PMF are controver- sial:  Can  we  really  specify  an  upper  bound  to  the amount  of  rain  that  can  fall  in  a  given  time?  The consistent square-root scaling relationship in figure 4.43  for  rainfalls  measured  over  very  different  pre- cipitation  regimes  suggests  this  possibility.  How- ever, we must recognize that the plotted values are only  those  that  have  been  observed  in  the  last  150 years over the infinitesimal fraction of the earth cov- ered by rain gauges; it is likely that higher amounts must  have  fallen  at  ungauged  locations  at  other times and places. And, conceptually, we can always imagine that a few more molecules of water could fall beyond any limit  that  is  specified.  In  support  of  this  view,  Pa- palexiou and Koutsoyiannis (2006) conducted statis- tical  analyses  of  humidity  and  rainfall  data  at  five locations  in  Europe,  and  found  no  evidence  for  an upper  bound  for  dew  point  or  precipitation.  They concluded  that  supposed  PMP  values  had  a  small but nonnegligible probability of being exceeded, and suggested that design rainfalls should be based on a probabilistic  analysis  of  extreme  rainfalls.  This  rea- soning now prevails in many countries: In a review of  rainfall-frequency  estimation  methods,  Svensson and Jones (2010) reported that the PMP has been re- Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Figure 4.44 Typical values of design-storm duration as a function of drainage area based on relations in McCuen (1998) and Pilgrim and Cordery (1992). placed  by  the  use  of  rainfalls  of  very  small  ex- ceedence  probability  in  Canada,  France,  South Africa, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, although they are still used as a basis for  designing  critical  structures  in  Sweden,  Ger- many, Australia, and Spain (Casas et al. 2008, 2010).

{"paragraph": "4.4.3.3 Depth-Duration-Frequency Analysis Most  engineering  and  land-use  planning  situa- tions  do  not  involve  the  risk  of  catastrophic  eco- nomic damage or loss of life that warrants design to PMF levels. For these less extreme circumstances— and, as noted above, increasingly for the entire range of  design  conditions—the  design  flood  is  the  flood with a specified annual exceedence probability: For a random variable X, the annual exceedence is the probability that X > x* in any year. That is, The variable X is either 1. an annual maximum time series; i.e., the largest value of a quantity in a year, in which case a sta- tistical sample consists of one value for each year (e.g., the annual maximum 1-hr rainfall), or 2. a partial-duration time series; i.e., the values of a quantity that exceed a specified threshold, x , in Figure 4.45 Generalized all-season PMP (1 in = 25.4 mm) for the eastern United States for a storm area of 200 mi2 (~500 km2) and durations hr.

Exceedence probability is the complement of the function  of  a  variable  X, cumulative  distribution F{x*}, defined as (section C.5). Exceedence probabilities are often ex- pressed  in  inverse  form  as  return  periods  or  recur- rence intervals: The return period (or recurrence interval) of number of years between exceedences of x*, which is given by TR{x*} = . Exceedence probability for a given x* calculated for a partial-duration  series  is  always  greater  than  for  an annual  series,  but  the  two  are  nearly  equal  for  ex- ceedence probabilities < 0.1 (return periods > 10 yr). Analogously with PMFs, the design flood is esti- mated by using a design rainfall with the appropriate duration  and  a  specified  exceedence  probability  as input to a hydrologic model. Estimation of the rainfall depths with a given ex- ceedence  probability  for  various  durations  is  called depth-duration-frequency  (DDF)  analysis.  An equivalent procedure differs only in using rainfall in- tensities  (depth  divided  by  duration)  rather  than depth,  and  is  called intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) analysis. Standard engineering practice dictates the return period appropriate for a given situation, with higher return  periods  for  projects  that  have  higher  costs  of failure. For example, the flood with a return period of 25 yr (annual exceedence probability of 0.04) is com- monly used for designing culverts, while the “100-yr flood”  (annual  exceedence  probability  of  0.01)  is used to delineate floodplains for land-use planning. The appropriate design duration is that which produces the largest peak flood from the area of interest. In  general,  the  critical  duration  increases  with drainage area; figure 4.44 indicates a range of typical values.  DDF/IDF  analyses  are  usually  carried  out for several return periods and durations and the ap- propriate  duration  is  determined  by  comparing  the floods predicted by the simulation model. In most cases the hydrologist requires rainfall fre- quency analysis for a finite area, such as a watershed. Thus there are two parts to DDF/IDF procedure: 1. Determine  depth  or  intensity—probability  rela- tions  for  one  or  more  representative  rain-gauge locations in or near the region of interest. 2. Adjust  the  point  values  to  give  depth—or  inten- sity—probability relations for the region of interest. In  the  United  States,  the  first  step  of  DDF/IDF analyses  have  been  carried  out  by  the  National Weather Service for much of the country, and are read- ily available on the Internet, as described in box 4.7. 4.4.3.3.1. DDF/IDF Analysis at Gauges The analysis should begin with a review of the his- tory of the weather station to assure the quality of the observations (section 4.2.1.2.10) and that measurement conditions  have  not  changed  significantly.  Assuming that  conditions  have  been  stable,  or  observations  are suitably  adjusted,  the  annual  maximum  rainfalls  for each duration of interest are extracted from the record. As noted in box 4.7, these steps have been carried out for  many  stations  in  the  United  States  by  the  NWS, and the data can be readily downloaded. An example of  a  DDF/IDF  analysis  for  a  single  gauge  site  and  a single duration using these data is given in box 4.8 on p. 196 (figures 4.47, 4.48, and 4.49, all on p. 197). In  practice,  DDF/IDF  analyses  are  done  for  a range  of  durations,  and  the  appropriate  probability distribution is usually determined via a regional anal- ysis rather than for a single station. Recent research has explored new approaches to probability analysis of rainfall extremes (Castellarin et al. 2009; Ceresetti et al. 2010; Haerter et al. 2010). Svensson and Jones (2010)  reviewed  the  rainfall-frequency  estimation methods used in nine countries; they noted that it is inherently  difficult  to  estimate  long  return-period rainfalls from short data records, and that there is no obvious “best” way of doing it. Most countries use a preferred  regional  probability  distribution  function, with the GEV distribution (table C.1) being the most common.  Parameters  are  usually  estimated  region- ally; regional boundaries may be fixed, or the regions can be centered on the point of interest.

(1973) updated Hershfield’s maps for the 11 western states; and Frederick et al. (1977) gave maps for the central and eastern states for durations of 5 min to 1 hr. Examples of these maps are given in figure 4.46. These maps are gen- eralizations of analyses done in many locations, and are intended for use in design situations where local data are unavailable or where a complete DDF analysis is not economically justified. One must use caution in accept- ing these generalized map values in areas where precip- itation is highly variable spatially due to variations in relief and exposure, and in large metropolitan areas where the urban “heat-island” effects may increase the frequency of heavy rainfalls. Accessing Maximum Precipitation Time-Series Data Time-series data for stations used in the Atlas 14 analyses can be downloaded at http:// hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_series.html. First, select the appropriate volume of Atlas 14, then specify (1) annual maximum or partial-duration series and (2) duration from drop-down menus. Then click to down- load the time-series data for all stations in the region in text (.txt) format. Data for specific stations (the date of the observation and the depth in inches) can be selected from the downloaded file and transferred as a text file into a single column in an Excel spreadsheet. Then using the “text-to-columns” feature for width- delimited fields, the date and amount can be entered into separate columns. An entry of “–9.99” in the depth column indicates missing data for that year. Unit conver- sion and conversion from depth to intensity (depth divided by duration) can then be accomplished in the spreadsheet if desired. where I is intensity, D is duration, and a, b, c, d are empirical  constants  (Wenzel  1982;  Durrans  2010). These equations have no theoretical basis and, as the Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange Figure 4.46 Examples of generalized depth-duration-frequency maps for the United States (1 in = 25.4 mm).

The annual maximum 1-hr rainfalls for 1900–2000 at that location can be found on the disk accompanying this text (see M a x   R a i n f a ll s  P h il a d e lp h i a   PA . d o c ). The data were ob t a i n e d   a s   d es c r ib e d  i n   b o x  4 . 7 . Before conducting the DDF analysis, the time series of annual maxima should be plotted for visual examination and statistically tested to assure that the time series is homogeneous and stationary, i.e., that it does not contain trends, jumps, or cycles that might be caused by changes in measurement conditions or climatic fluctuations. Non- stationarity due to climatic change is a real concern, as recent studies have shown increases in extreme precipi- tation in the United States (Knight and Davis 2009; Villar- ini et al. 2011) and Europe (Zolina et al. 2010; Shiu et al. 2012). Several statistical tests that can detect time-series anomalies are described in section C.11. The plot of figure 4.47 and statistical tests do not suggest any trends, jumps, or cycles, so the Philadelphia time series can be considered homogeneous and stationary. To provide an introduction to DDF/IDF analysis, we will fit a probability distribution to the Philadelphia data and estimate the return periods of annual maximum 1-hr rainfalls. We do this via the “L-moment” approach (section C.9.2), which is widely accepted as the preferred method for identifying an appropriate probability distri- bution for hydrologic and climatic data. The sample L- moment values are calculated as described in box C.3 (see disk); for the Philadelphia data we find the following sample L-moment values:   = 31.6 mm,   = 5.54 mm, = 0.628 mm, and   = 0.874. To identify the appropri- ate distribution we calculate the L-skewness 0.113, and the L-kurtosis referring to the L-moment dia- / 0.158; gram of figure C.10, we see that these values determine a point

challenges associated with estimating long return-period rainfalls from short data records?", "answer": "Estimating long return-period rainfalls from short data records is inherently difficult because

{"paragraph": "4.4.4.2 Intentional Weather Modification Human attempts to modify weather—particularly to increase rainfall when needed for agriculture—are as old as civilization. However, only since the 1940s, when scientific understanding of the precipitation pro- cess  accelerated,  has  intentional weather  modifica- tion become a realistic management alternative. The  main  goals  of  precipitation-augmentation activities in the United States have been to increase snowfall  from  winter  cyclonic/orographic  storms and  rainfall  from  summertime  convective  clouds. Both  cases involve  seeding—the introduction of artificial cloud-condensation nuclei (CCN) in the form  of  crystals  of  silver  iodide  (AgI)  that  serve  as templates for the formation of ice crystals, or of com- mon  salt  (NaCl)  that  induce  droplet  growth  by  hy- groscopic action (section 3.4). In the first case, it has been  found  that  snowfall  from  orographic  clouds with  temperatures  from  –10  to  –23°C  can  be  in- Chapter 4 Precipitation creased by providing the additional nuclei; however, seeding colder clouds in otherwise similar conditions may cause overseeding, which reduces precipitation because the available cloud water is spread over the more  abundant  nuclei  and  few  of  the  ice  crystals grow large enough to fall. In supercooled convective clouds the additional nuclei trigger the formation of ice crystals, and the resulting evolution of latent heat accelerates  uplift  within  the  cloud  and  triggers  the process of precipitation formation. One of the requirements for the formation of sig- nificant  precipitation  is  the  continuing  importation of  water  vapor  into  the  precipitating  cloud  (section 3.4).  This  requirement  imposes  limitations  on  the usefulness  of  cloud  seeding  for  precipitation  en- hancement—where this importation does not occur, the  introduction  of  CCN  may  cause  most  of  the cloud moisture to precipitate, resulting in minor pre- cipitation  and  the  disappearance  of  the  cloud.  In fact,  cloud  seeding  is  sometimes  done  under  these conditions  in  order  to  dissipate  fogs  and  stratiform clouds. Attempts also have been made to exploit the overseeding  phenomenon  to  prevent  or  reduce  hail formation  and  to  reduce  the  intensity  of  hurricanes (see Mather 1984; AMS 1992). Reviews  of  the  status  of  weather  modification (AMS 1992; Orville 1995) found that (1) AgI seeding has  produced  significant  precipitation  increases  in several  experiments;  (2)  seasonal  precipitation  in- creases of 10 to 30% have been produced by seeding supercooled  orographic  clouds;  (3)  seeding  may  in- crease  or  decrease  precipitation  from  convective clouds, and the conditions contributing to positive or negative  results  are  not  well  understood;  and  (4) rainfall can be increased by seeding warm-based (> 10°C)  convective  clouds  under  certain  conditions. These reviews also noted that increases or decreases in precipitation may be induced beyond the target ar- eas,  with  potential  negative  impacts,  and  that  the economic viability of precipitation augmentation has not been demonstrated. A  more  recent  review  by  the  US  National  Re- search  Council  (2003)  reported  that  operational weather-modification programs were underway in 24 countries  and  21  US  states.  However,  the  report found  that  very  little  scientific  research  was  being done, and that “there is still no convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modifica- tion” (p. 3). It noted that weather modification does have  potential  for  alleviating  water-resource  stresses and  weather  hazards  and  recommended  that,  be- Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange cause  observational  techniques  and  scientific  under- standing of cloud physics have advanced considerably in  recent  years,  the  United  States  should  invest  in  a research  program  to  improve  understanding  of  pre- cipitation  microphysics,  cloud  dynamics,  efficacy  of cloud-seeding  agents,  and  testing  of  cloud  models.

If this importation does not occur, the introduction of cloud-condensation nuclei (CCN) may cause most of the cloud moisture to precipitate, resulting in minor precipitation and the disappearance of the cloud. This limitation imposes constraints on the usefulness of cloud seeding for precipitation enhancement."}, {"question": "How does the phenomenon of overseeding relate to the prevention or reduction of hail formation and the intensity of hurricanes?", "answer": "The overseeding phenomenon can be exploited to prevent or reduce hail formation and to reduce the intensity of hurricanes.

As  noted  by  Ka- zmann  (1988),  this  could  well  be  the  most  serious impact,  because  most  water-management  decisions rely  in  significant  part  on  statistical  quantities  such as averages, return periods, and probable maximum values of precipitation and the resulting streamflow.

{"paragraph": "5.1 Hydrologic Importance of Snow Over much of the land above 45°N latitude (fig- ure 2.26), a significant portion of precipitation falls as snow that is stored on the surface for periods ranging from hours to months before melting and continuing through the land phase of the hydrologic cycle. Figure 5.1 shows the steep latitudinal increase in the fraction of  average  annual  precipitation  falling  as  snow  in North  America;  this  fraction  reaches  about  65%  on Snow and Snowmelt the north coast of Alaska (Dingman et al. 1980). Lo- cation relative to oceans and elevation also influence the portion of precipitation occurring as snow. As noted by Frei et al. (2012), annual snow ac- cumulation  and  melt  are  among  the  most  dramatic environmental changes on the earth’s surface. These phenomena influence a range of oceanographic, cli- matic,  and  ecological,  as  well  as  hydrologic,  pro- the stability of permafrost and consequent effects on global carbon budgets, and (3) fresh-water flux to the oceans and the strength of oceanic circulations. In areas with a significant seasonal snowpack, it is the amount and timing of water input (i.e., snow- melt  plus  rain)  rather  than  of  precipitation,  that largely determines the availability of water to vegeta- tion  and  the  amount  and  timing  of  streamflow  (in- cluding  floods)  and  ground-water  recharge  (figure 5.2 on  p. 205). Since a smaller proportion of snow- melt  than  of  rainfall  is  evaporated  and  transpired, snowfall  contributes  proportionally  more  to  runoff and  ground-water  recharge;  L’vovich  (1974)  esti- mated  that  more  than  half  the  annual  runoff  is  de- rived  from  snowmelt  in  much  of  the  Northern Hemisphere (figure 5.3 on p. 206). For mountain re- gions,  as  much  as  85%  of  the  annual  runoff  may come from snowmelt (Shafer and Dezman 1982). Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange In  spite  of  the  hydrologic  importance  of  the melting of seasonal snow, there have been few stud- ies characterizing water-input climatology. An early regional  study  showed  that  water-input  climatology in New England is determined by latitude and eleva- tion, and it developed a method for determining cli- matic  and  synoptic  patterns  of  water  input  from standard  network  observations  of  temperature  and precipitation (Hendrick and DeAngelis 1976). More recently,  Bookhagen  and  Burbank  (2010)  quantified the hydrologic importance of snowmelt in the Hima- layas,  where  changes  in  the  timing  or  amount  of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures or decreas- ing winter precipitation may have far-reaching soci- etal consequences. The  overwhelming  evidence  of  general  global warming  (section  2.1.3.2)  makes  a  broader  under- standing of the role of snow in the hydrologic cycle of  critical  importance.  To  provide  a  general  frame- work  for  this  understanding,  Molini  et  al.  (2011) used  a  simple  model  of  climate  and  watershed  re- sponse  to  explore  the  relation  between  streamflow and water-input climatology. They found that, while increased air temperatures reduce winter snow accu- mulation  and  reduce  total  snowmelt  amounts,  they intensify snowmelt rate and thus increase the annual peak discharge. Thus there is an optimal warm-sea- Figure 5.1 Fraction of precip- itation occurring as snow as a func- tion of latitude in the United States.

These fractions have probably decreased since these data were assembled due to warming (section 2.2.8.2). son  length  for  which  the  annual  peak  discharge reaches a maximum; this length is a function of the watershed  residence  (figure  5.4  on  p.  206). Where  warm-season  length  is  less  than  this  opti- mum, peak discharge is limited by slow melting dy- namics; where it is greater, peak discharge is reduced by  decreased  winter  snow  accumulation.  Thus  al- though global snow cover has been declining mark- edly  over  the  last  two  decades  and  the  average annual  duration  of  Northern  Hemisphere  snow cover has decreased by 15 to 18 days since the early 1970s (box 2.3), the magnitudes of snowmelt floods could increase or decrease depending on warm-sea- son length and watershed characteristics. The  dynamics  of  floods  due  to  heavy  rain  and accompanying  warm  temperatures  on  an  extensive snowpack  (“rain-on-snow  floods”)  are  not  well  un- derstood, and are likely to become an increasing haz- ard  due  to  global  warming,  especially  in  Arctic regions  (Putkonen  et  al.  2009).  Jones  and  Perkins (2010) examined the effects of snow, event size, basin size, and forest harvest on floods in three small (< 1 km2)  km2) and  six  large  (60–600  watersheds  in  the western  Cascades  of  Oregon.  Rain-on-snow  events delivered  75%  more  water  to  soils  than  rain  events; peak discharges of rain-on-snow events were almost twice as high as rain-event peaks in large basins, but Figure 5.2 Average monthly precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P – ET) and water input (snowmelt plus Hampshire.

In  extreme floods,  prolonged  precipitation  and  synchronous snowmelt  produced  rapid,  synchronized  hydro- graph  responses  to  small  variations  in  precipitation intensity.

According to L'vovich (1974), more than half the annual runoff is derived from snowmelt in much of the Northern Hemisphere. This is significant because it highlights the importance of snowmelt in replenishing water resources."}, {"question": "Why is the timing and amount of water input, rather than precipitation, crucial in areas with a significant seasonal snowpack?", "answer": "The timing and amount of water input (i.e., snowmelt plus rain) are crucial because they largely determine the availability of water to vegetation and the amount and timing of streamflow, including floods, and groundwater recharge. This is because snowmelt and rainfall have different dynamics and impacts on the hydrologic cycle, with snowmelt contributing more to runoff and groundwater recharge. Understanding these dynamics is essential for managing water resources and predicting hydrologic events."}, {"question": "In the context of global warming, how might changes in snowmelt affect the annual peak discharge in watersheds?", "answer": "Changes in snowmelt due to global warming could either increase or decrease the annual peak discharge in watersheds, depending on the warm-season length and watershed characteristics. According to Molini et al. (2011), increased air temperatures can reduce winter snow accumulation and total snowmelt amounts but intensify the snowmelt rate, leading to an increase in the annual peak discharge. However, if the warm-season length is less than the optimum, peak discharge is limited by slow melting dynamics, while a longer warm season reduces peak discharge due to decreased winter snow accumulation."}, {"question": "What role does the structure of forests play in extreme rain-on-snow floods, and why is further research needed?", "answer": "The evolving structure of forests has an important influence on extreme rain-on-snow floods, as found by Jones and Perkins (2010). Further research is needed to delineate areas experiencing snowmelt and describe flow paths in melting snowpacks, which is crucial for understanding and predicting these events. This is particularly important in the context of global warming, where changes in precipitation patterns and snowmelt dynamics may lead to more frequent and severe rain-on-snow floods, posing significant challenges for water resource management and flood risk mitigation."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic importance, why is snow considered a critical component of the hydrologic cycle?", "answer": "Snow is considered a critical component of the hydrologic cycle because it stores a significant portion of precipitation on the surface for periods ranging from hours to months before melting and continuing through the land phase of the hydrologic cycle. This storage and subsequent melt influence a range of oceanographic, climatic, and ecological processes, as well as hydrologic ones, including the stability of permafrost, freshwater flux to the oceans, and the strength of oceanic circulations. The hydrologic importance of snow is further underscored by its contribution to runoff and groundwater recharge, making it essential for maintaining water resources and ecosystems."}, {"question": "How does the fraction of precipitation occurring as snow vary with latitude, and what implications does this have for hydrologic processes?", "answer": "The fraction of precipitation occurring as snow increases steeply with latitude, reaching about 65% on the north coast of Alaska. This variation has significant implications for hydrologic processes, as snowmelt dynamics and the resulting runoff and groundwater recharge vary greatly between regions with different snowfall fractions.

For instance, when the snowpack is dry (low liquid-water content), its density is lower, and it has a higher porosity.

{"paragraph": "5.2.2 Snowpack Metamorphism The density of new-fallen snow is determined by the configuration of the snowflakes, which is largely a function of air temperature, the degree of supersat- uration  in  the  precipitating  cloud,  and  the  wind speed  at  the  surface  of  deposition  (Mellor  1964). Higher  wind  speeds  tend  to  break  snowflakes  that formed  in  stellar  or  needle-like  shapes  and  to  pack them  together  into  denser  layers.  Observed  relative densities  )  of  freshly  fallen  snow  range  from 0.004  to  0.34  (McKay  1970),  with  the  lower  values occurring  under  calm,  very  cold  conditions  and higher  values  accompanying  higher  winds  and higher temperatures; the usual range is 0.07 ≤ ρ /ρ ≤ 0.15 (Garstka 1964). Because  of  the  difficulty  in  measuring  the  den- sity of new snow, an average relative density of 0.1 is often assumed to apply when converting snowfall observations to SWE. However, the user of water-equivalent data should be aware  of  the  potential  for  significant  errors  in  esti- mates based on an assumed density (Goodison et al. density (kg/m3) 1981).  New-snow  can be estimated as a function of wet-bulb temperature, T , as + 15)1.5 = 50 + 1.7 · (T (Melloh et al. 2002), where wb a dp a is air temperature (°C), and T  is dew-point tem- perature (°C) (section 3.2.5). As  soon  as  snow  accumulates  on  the  surface  it begins  a  process  of  metamorphism  that  continues until  melting  is  complete.  Four  mechanisms  are largely responsible for this process:  (1)  gravitational tive metamorphism; and (4) melt metamorphism. Gravitational settling in a given snow layer takes place  at  rates  that  increase  with  the  weight  of  the overlying snow and the temperature of the layer and decrease with the density of the layer. According to relations  given  by Anderson  (1976), one can  expect gravitational  settling  to  increase  density  at  rates  on the order of 2 to 50 kg/m3 · d in shallow snowpacks. On  glaciers,  the  pressure  of  thick  layers  of  accumu- lating snow is the principal factor leading to the for- mation of solid ice. metamorphism  occurs  because  va- Destructive por  pressures  are  higher  over  convex  ice  surfaces with smaller radii of curvature, so the points and pro- jections of snowflakes tend to evaporate (sublimate) and  the  vapor  to  redeposit  on  nearby,  less  convex surfaces. This leads to the formation of larger, more spherical snow grains with time. This process is pri- marily  important  in  snowflakes  that  have  recently fallen, causing the density of a new-snow layer to in- crease at about 1% per hour. The process ceases to be important  when  densities  reach  about  250 (Anderson 1976). Constructive metamorphism is the most impor- tant pre-melt densification process in seasonal snow- packs.  Over  short  distances,  this  process  occurs  by sintering, in which water molecules are deposited in concavities where two snow grains touch, gradually building a “neck” between adjacent grains. Over lon- ger distances, constructive metamorphism can occur as a result of vapor transfer within a snowpack due to  temperature  gradients;  sublimation  occurs  in warmer portions of the snowpack and the water va- por  moves  toward  colder  portions  where  condensa- tion  occurs.  Very  cold  air  overlying  a  relatively shallow  snowpack  often  produces  a  strong  upward- decreasing  temperature  gradient  within  the  snow, with  a  concomitant  upward-decreasing  vapor-pres- sure gradient. Under these conditions, snow near the base of  the  pack  evaporates  at  a high rate, often  re- sulting in a basal layer of characteristic large planar crystals  with  very  low  density  and  strength  called depth hoar. metamorphism  occurs  via  two  processes. In the first, liquid water formed by melting at the sur- face  or  introduced  as  rain  freezes  as  it  percolates downward  into  the  cold  snowpack.  This  results  in densification,  and  may  produce  layers  of  essentially Chapter 5 Snow and Snowmelt solid ice that extend over long distances. The freezing at depth also liberates latent heat, which contributes to the warming of the snowpack and the acceleration of  vapor  transfer.  The  second  metamorphic  process accompanying  melt  is  the  rapid  disappearance  of smaller snow grains and growth of larger grains that occurs in the presence of liquid water. Because of this phenomenon,  an  actively  melting  snowpack  is  typi- cally  an  aggregation  of  rounded  grains  the  size  of coarse sand (1 to 2 mm diameter) (Colbeck 1978). Except  for  the  temporary  formation  of  depth hoar,  all  the  processes  of  metamorphism  lead  to  a progressive increase in density throughout the snow- accumulation season (figure 5.6). It should be noted, however,  that  there  is  much  year-to-year  variability in  snowpack  characteristics  and  that  both  snowfall and  the  processes  causing  metamorphism  occur  at highly variable rates over short distances due largely to differences in slope, aspect, and vegetative cover. At  the  beginning  of  the  melt  season,  the  snow- pack  is  typically  vertically  heterogeneous  as  well, with  perhaps  several  layers  of  markedly  contrasting grain  sizes  and  densities.  During  melt,  density  con- tinues  to  increase  and  the  vertical  inhomogeneities tend  to  disappear.  During  this  period,  density  can fluctuate on an hourly or daily time scale due to the formation  and  drainage  of  meltwater.  Snowpacks that are at 0°C and well drained tend to have relative densities near 0.35 (McKay 1970).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of snowpack metamorphism, what factors determine the density of new-fallen snow?", "answer": "The density of new-fallen snow is determined by the configuration of the snowflakes, which is largely a function of air temperature, the degree of supersaturation in the precipitating cloud, and the wind speed at the surface of deposition."}, {"question": "Why does the density of new-snow layers increase over time due to destructive metamorphism?", "answer": "Destructive metamorphism occurs because vapor pressures are higher over convex ice surfaces with smaller radii of curvature, leading to the evaporation (sublimation) of snowflake points and projections, and the redeposition of vapor on nearby, less convex surfaces, resulting in the formation of larger, more spherical snow grains and an increase in density."}, {"question": "How does constructive metamorphism contribute to the densification of snowpacks?", "answer": "Constructive metamorphism contributes to the densification of snowpacks through two processes: sintering, where water molecules are deposited in concavities between snow grains, gradually building a \"neck\" between adjacent grains, and vapor transfer within the snowpack due to temperature gradients, where sublimation occurs in warmer portions and condensation occurs in colder portions, leading to the growth of larger snow grains and increased density."}, {"question": "In the context of snowpack characteristics, what is the typical relative density of snowpacks that are at 0°C and well drained?", "answer": "Snowpacks that are at 0°C and well drained tend to have relative densities near 0.35."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to accurately estimate the water-equivalent of snowfall based on an assumed density?", "answer": "The challenge arises because the actual density of new snow can vary significantly, ranging from 0.004 to 0.34, and using an average relative density of 0.1 may lead to significant errors in estimates.

This process is particularly important in snowpacks with strong upward-decreasing temperature gradients, such as those with very cold air overlying a relatively shallow snowpack."}, {"question": "Why do snowpacks exhibit year-to-year variability in characteristics, and what factors contribute to this variability?", "answer": "Snowpacks exhibit year-to-year variability in characteristics due to differences in snowfall and the processes causing metamorphism, which occur at highly variable rates over short distances.

{"paragraph": "5.3.3.3 Snow Surveys As noted, the most important snow information for the hydrologist is the water equivalent of the snow cover.  Network  measurements  of  this  quantity  are most commonly obtained via periodic snow surveys at fixed locations called snow courses, coupled with automated snow-pillow stations (section 5.3.3.4). A  snow  course  is  a  path  between  two  fixed  end points over which a series of measurements of snow depth and SWE are made. The length of the path is typically 150 to 250 m, with measurements made at about six points (more if snow conditions are highly variable) spaced at a fixed interval of at least 30 m. At each point, a coring tube equipped with a toothed cut- ting  rim,  called  a  tube  (figure  5.9),  is  inserted vertically to the surface. After the snow depth is read against markings on the outside of the tube, the tube is pushed a few centimeters into the soil and twisted to secure a small plug of soil that retains the snow in the tube. The tube is then extracted and weighed on a specially  calibrated  scale  that  is  pre-tared  and  reads Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange directly in centimeters or inches of water equivalent. Density at each point can be calculated via equation (5.10), and SWE for the course is the average of the values  at  the  measurement  points.  A  detailed  guide for snow-survey techniques was published by the US Soil Conservation Service (1984) and can be accessed at  http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/factpub/ah169/ ah169.htm. Several different designs of snow tube are avail- able;  they  may  be  made  of  aluminum  or  fiberglass and range in diameter from 3.8 to 7.6 cm. Compari- sons  with  snow  carefully  excavated  and  weighed have  shown  a  tendency  for  snow  tubes  to  overesti- mate SWE by up to 10% (Work et al. 1965; Goodi- son et al. 1981). In shallow (i.e., less than about 1 m) snowpacks, depth and density have been found to be essentially independent, and there is typically less temporal and spatial variability in density than in depth (Goodison et al. 1981). Under these conditions, little precision is lost and considerable time may be gained by making more depth measurements than SWE measurements (Jonas et al. 2009). A  snow-course  network,  like  a  precipitation- gauge network, should be designed to provide a rep- resentative picture of the snowpack in the region of interest. However, since measurements are labor in- tensive, snow courses are usually considerably more widely  spaced  than  gauges  and  are  usually  read  at longer  time  intervals—e.g.,  every  two  weeks  during the  snow  season.  Because  snowpack  conditions  are largely determined by local conditions, snow-course networks  should  be  designed  to  sample  representa- tive  ranges  of  land  use  (vegetative  cover),  slope,  as- pect,  and  elevation.

The  weight  of  the  snow  on  the  pillow controls the pressure of the liquid, which is recorded or monitored via a manometer or pressure transducer. The diameter of snow pillows ranges from 1 to 4 m,  with  larger  diameters  recommended  for  deeper snowpacks  (Barton  1974).  Several  factors  influence the  accuracy  and  continuity  of  readings,  including (1)  leaks;  (2)  temperature  variations  that  affect  the density of the liquid; (3) the formation of ice layers within the snowpack, which can support a portion of the  snow  and  lead  to  undermeasurement  of  SWE tween  the  snow  and  the  ground,  which  can  distort the snowpack energy and water balances; and, in re- mote installations, (5) instability of power supply to sensors  and  recorders.  Detailed  considerations  for installation  and  maintenance  of  snow  pillows  were given  by  Davis  (1973)  and  Cox  et  al.  (1978),  and measurement  problems  were  discussed  by  McGurk and Azuma (1992) and McGurk et al. (1993).

Buried lines transmit the fluid pressure from the pillow to a sensor, and the water released by the snowpack to a measuring device, both of which are in an instrument shelter. The metal ring is electrically heated, and is melted down through the snowpack to isolate the cylinder of snow above the lysimeter (photo by author). The  universal  gauge  (figure  5.8)  measures  SWE  us- ing the same basic principle as the snow pillow. Snow pillows are well suited for remote installa- tion.

The false low readings of the radiation detector were due to radioac- tivity deposited during snow storms and could easily be corrected for [Bissell and Peck (1973). Monitoring snow water equivalent by using natural soil radioactivity. Water Resources Research 9:885–890, with permission of the American Geophysical Union]. Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange snowpacks (SNOTEL); however, they are subject to bridging,  temperature  effects,  and  failures  of  instru- ment components (Goodison et al. 1981; McGurk et al. 1993). Figure 5.11b compares SWE measured via snow tube,  snow  pillow,  and  a  fixed  radio-isotope  gauge over several days at one location. Natural radioactiv- ity  deposited  with  falling  snow  caused  false  low readings by the gamma detector, but this was found to  decay  rapidly  and  could  readily  be  corrected  for (Bissell and Peck 1973). Thus all three methods ap- pear  to  give  similar  results.  Goodison  (1981)  com- pared snow-survey and snowfall data in Canada and found  that  compatible  estimates  of  regional  SWE were  possible  only  if:  (1)  snow-survey  data  are weighted to account for the variability of SWE as a function of land use and (2) precipitation-gauge mea- surements  of snowfall are  corrected for gauge-catch deficiencies due to wind. Techniques  involving  spatial  interpolation  simi- lar to those described for mapping of areal precipita- tion  (section  4.3.2)  have  been  developed  and  are routinely  used  for  mapping  the  areal  distribution  of SWE in the United States (Carroll and Cressie 1996). Remotely sensed observations via aircraft or sat- ellite using active or passive microwave, infrared, or visible wavelengths are now the main source of infor- mation on the areal extent of snow cover. As noted, the NOHRSC program makes these readily available for the United States and the Northern Hemisphere.

However, they are labor-intensive and impractical for routine use in remote areas. This limitation necessitates the use of alternative methods in such regions."}, {"question": "How do snow pillows compare to snow-survey observations in terms of accuracy and practicality for remote monitoring of mountain snowpacks?", "answer": "Snow pillows are generally accurate and widely used in the western United States for remote monitoring. However, they are subject to issues like bridging, temperature effects, and instrument component failures, which can affect their accuracy. Despite these challenges, they offer a practical solution for remote areas where snow-survey observations are not feasible."}, {"question": "Why do natural radioactivity deposits from falling snow cause false low readings in gamma detectors, and how can these errors be corrected?", "answer": "Natural radioactivity deposited with falling snow causes false low readings in gamma detectors because the additional radioactivity interferes with the detector's ability to accurately measure the water equivalent of the snow. These false readings can be corrected for, as the effect of the deposited radioactivity decays rapidly. This correction is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of SWE measurements obtained through gamma radiation detection methods."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating regional SWE, what conditions must be met to achieve compatible estimates from snow-survey and snowfall data?", "answer": "To achieve compatible estimates of regional SWE from snow-survey and snowfall data, two conditions must be met: (1) snow-survey data must be weighted to account for the variability of SWE as a function of land use, and (2) precipitation-gauge measurements of snowfall must be corrected for gauge-catch deficiencies due to wind. Meeting these conditions ensures that the estimates from both methods are reliable and comparable."}, {"question": "What role do remotely sensed observations play in understanding the areal extent of snow cover, and how are they utilized in water-resource management decisions?", "answer": "Remotely sensed observations via aircraft or satellite using various wavelengths are the main source of information on the areal extent of snow cover. These observations, combined with water-equivalent information from remote snow pillows and airborne gamma radiation detection, are widely used for water-resource management decisions, especially in the western United States. This integration of data sources provides critical information for managing water resources effectively, particularly in regions where snowmelt significantly impacts water availability."}, {"question": "How do techniques involving spatial interpolation contribute to the mapping of areal SWE distribution, and what is their significance in hydrological applications?", "answer": "Techniques involving spatial interpolation, similar to those used for mapping areal precipitation, have been developed and are routinely used for mapping the areal distribution of SWE. These techniques are significant because they enable the creation of detailed maps of SWE, which are essential for understanding and predicting water availability, runoff, and other hydrological processes. The application of these techniques is crucial for water-resource management, as it allows for more accurate planning and decision-making."}, {"question": "In the context of water-resource management, why is it essential to have accurate measurements of SWE, and what are the implications of inaccurate measurements?", "answer": "Accurate measurements of SWE are essential for water-resource management because they directly impact the ability to predict water availability, manage runoff, and plan for future water needs. Inaccurate measurements can lead to mismanagement of water resources, affecting not only the environment but also human settlements and agricultural activities that depend on water. The implications of inaccurate SWE measurements can be significant, ranging from inefficient water allocation to increased risk of floods or droughts, highlighting the need for reliable and accurate SWE measurement techniques."}, {"question": "What are the challenges associated with using gamma radiation detection for measuring SWE, and how can these challenges be addressed?", "answer": "The primary challenge with using gamma radiation detection for measuring SWE is the potential for false low readings due to natural radioactivity deposited with falling snow.

Addressing this challenge is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of SWE measurements obtained through gamma radiation detection, making it a viable method for remote and continuous monitoring of snowpacks."}, {"question": "How does the NOHRSC program contribute to the understanding and management of snow cover and its water equivalent?", "answer": "The NOHRSC program plays a significant role in the understanding and management of snow cover and its water equivalent by making remotely sensed observations of snow cover extent readily available for the United States and the Northern Hemisphere. These observations, when combined with other data sources such as telemetered remote snow pillows and airborne detection of gamma radiation, provide comprehensive information that is critical for water-resource management decisions."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.3.4.1 Lysimeters The most straightforward method for measuring water  output  is  via  a  lysimeter  (figure  5.10),  which collects the water draining from the overlying snow and directs it to a device that records the flow (Haupt 1969). This instrument may be fitted with a circular metal  ring  that  can  be  electrically  heated  and  low- ered through the snow to isolate the cylinder of snow above the collecting surface to avoid gaining or loos- ing  water  that  might  be  moving  horizontally  along ice  layers  in  the  snowpack.

This interruption can affect the natural processes occurring within the snowpack, such as heat transfer and water movement. As a result, the measurements obtained from a lysimeter may not perfectly represent the conditions in the undisturbed snowpack, which can have implications for the accuracy of water output measurements."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a lysimeter for measuring water output in terms of snowpack representation?", "answer": "The use of a lysimeter can lead to differences in snow conditions above the instrument compared to the natural snowpack, primarily due to the disruption of the snow-ground connection.

Furthermore, understanding these implications is crucial for accurately assessing water output and making informed decisions in hydrological applications."}, {"question": "How does the design of a lysimeter address potential issues with horizontal water movement in the snowpack?", "answer": "The design of a lysimeter includes a circular metal ring that can be electrically heated and lowered through the snow. This feature allows for the isolation of the cylinder of snow above the collecting surface, thereby preventing the gain or loss of water that might be moving horizontally along ice layers in the snowpack. By addressing this potential issue, the lysimeter can provide more accurate measurements of water output."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological measurements, why is it important to consider the potential for horizontal water movement in the snowpack?", "answer": "Considering the potential for horizontal water movement in the snowpack is important because it can significantly impact the accuracy of water output measurements. If water is moving horizontally along ice layers, it may not be captured by the measurement device, leading to underestimation or overestimation of the actual water output. By accounting for this phenomenon, hydrologists can ensure more reliable data and improve their understanding of snowpack dynamics."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of electrically heating the metal ring in a lysimeter?", "answer": "The purpose of electrically heating the metal ring in a lysimeter is to facilitate its movement through the snow and to isolate the cylinder of snow above the collecting surface. This process helps to prevent the gain or loss of water that might be moving horizontally along ice layers in the snowpack, thereby ensuring more accurate measurements of water output."}, {"question": "In the context of snowpack measurement, how do lysimeters compare to snow pillows in terms of potential limitations?", "answer": "Both lysimeters and snow pillows have potential limitations in measuring snowpack conditions. For lysimeters, the interruption of the snow-ground connection can lead to differences in snow conditions above the instrument compared to the natural snowpack. Similarly, snow pillows may also have limitations due to their design and placement. Understanding these limitations is essential for selecting the most appropriate measurement technique for a given application and for interpreting the resulting data accurately."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to obtain accurate measurements of water output from the snowpack using lysimeters?", "answer": "Obtaining accurate measurements of water output from the snowpack using lysimeters can be challenging due to the potential for horizontal water movement along ice layers and the interruption of the snow-ground connection. These factors can lead to differences in snow conditions above the lysimeter compared to the natural snowpack, affecting the representativeness of the measurements.

This is crucial for understanding water balance and runoff predictions in snow-dominated catchments. By assuming that the weight loss is primarily due to water running off, hydrologists can estimate the amount of water contributed by snowmelt to the overall water budget, which is essential for managing water resources, predicting floods, and understanding ecosystem responses to changing snow regimes."}, {"question": "How does the assumption that water runs off the pillow affect the interpretation of snow pillow data?", "answer": "The assumption that water runs off the pillow is critical for interpreting snow pillow data because it directly influences how ablation is calculated. If water does not run off as assumed, but instead is retained or evaporates, the weight change measured by the snow pillow would not accurately reflect ablation. This assumption simplifies the complex processes involved in snowmelt and runoff, allowing for a more straightforward interpretation of the data. However, it also means that any deviation from this assumption, such as significant evaporation or water retention, could lead to inaccuracies in estimating ablation rates and, by extension, water outflow predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of water balance, why is understanding ablation from snow pillows important?", "answer": "Understanding ablation from snow pillows is important for water balance because it provides critical information on the amount of water being contributed by snowmelt to streams, rivers, and groundwater. This information is vital for predicting water availability, managing water resources, and mitigating the effects of droughts and floods. Accurate measurements of ablation help hydrologists and water managers understand the dynamics of the water cycle in snow-dominated regions, which is essential for making informed decisions about water allocation, conservation, and protection of aquatic ecosystems."}, {"question": "What are the implications of neglecting evaporation in snow pillow measurements for hydrological modeling?", "answer": "Neglecting evaporation in snow pillow measurements can have significant implications for hydrological modeling, particularly in regions where evaporation plays a substantial role in the water balance. If evaporation is not accounted for, the estimated water outflow from snowmelt could be overestimated, leading to inaccuracies in runoff predictions and water balance calculations. This, in turn, could affect the reliability of hydrological models used for forecasting and decision-making, potentially leading to mismanagement of water resources. However, as mentioned, in many cases, evaporation can be considered negligible, which simplifies the modeling process but also underscores the need for careful consideration of the specific hydrological context."}, {"question": "In the context of snow hydrology, how do snow pillows contribute to understanding the water cycle?", "answer": "Snow pillows contribute to understanding the water cycle by providing direct measurements of snowmelt, which is a critical component of the water balance in snow-dominated regions. By measuring the weight change of the snow, which corresponds to the amount of water being released through melting, snow pillows offer insights into the timing, magnitude, and rate of snowmelt. This information is essential for understanding the dynamics of the water cycle, including how snowpack acts as a natural reservoir, storing water during the winter months and releasing it during the spring and summer. This understanding is vital for managing water resources effectively and predicting water availability for various uses, including irrigation, drinking water supply, and ecosystem maintenance."}, {"question": "Why are snow pillows useful for detecting changes in snowmelt patterns over time?", "answer": "Snow pillows are useful for detecting changes in snowmelt patterns over time because they provide continuous, direct measurements of snowmelt. By monitoring the weight change of the snow pillow over seasons and years, hydrologists can identify trends and anomalies in snowmelt patterns. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, where alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns can significantly impact snowmelt dynamics. The data from snow pillows can help in understanding how these changes affect water availability and quality, allowing for more informed decision-making regarding water resource management and adaptation strategies to climate change."}, {"question": "In the context of water resource management, what is the significance of accurate ablation measurements from snow pillows?", "answer": "Accurate ablation measurements from snow pillows are significant for water resource management because they inform predictions of water yield from snowmelt.

For example, snowmelt can lead to sudden increases in streamflow, while rainfall can cause more gradual changes. Evaporation, on the other hand, reduces the amount of water available for other processes, impacting both surface and groundwater resources. The accurate identification and quantification of these processes are essential for predictive modeling, water supply forecasting, and the development of effective strategies for managing water resources sustainably."}, {"question": "In the context of universal gauges, what is the relationship between water output and weight decrease during snowmelt?", "answer": "During snowmelt, there is a corresponding decrease in weight as water output increases, indicating that the snowpack is melting and releasing water."}, {"question": "How do universal gauges contribute to the understanding of the water cycle?", "answer": "Universal gauges contribute to the understanding of the water cycle by providing data on water output and weight changes, which can be used to infer the occurrence of snowmelt, rainfall, and evaporation.

By distinguishing between these hydrological processes, universal gauges help in assessing water availability, predicting water-related hazards, and managing water resources effectively. Moreover, the data from universal gauges can be integrated with other hydrological and meteorological data to improve our understanding of the complex interactions within the water cycle and to develop more accurate models of hydrological systems."}, {"question": "Why is the measurement of weight decrease important in universal gauges?", "answer": "The measurement of weight decrease is important in universal gauges because it allows for the detection of snowmelt and evaporation.

This inaccuracy could result from differences in energy balance and moisture flux between the pan and the surrounding snowpack, ultimately affecting the reliability of hydrological models and water resource management decisions. For instance, if the surface of the snow in the pan is smoother than the surrounding area, it might enhance evaporation and sublimation rates due to reduced aerodynamic resistance, leading to overestimation of these processes. Conversely, a rougher surface could lead to underestimation.

Using a shallow pan could result in inaccurate measurements, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the rates of these processes. This, in turn, could impact the accuracy of snowmelt runoff predictions and water balance models, affecting decisions related to water management, flood control, and ecosystem health.

{"paragraph": "5.4 Distribution of Snow Snow  accumulation  and  properties  are  highly dependent on local topography and site factors such as  aspect  (slope  orientation)  and  vegetation  cover. For example, Rice and Bales (2010) found that snow depths during both accumulation and ablation peri- ods varied by up to 50% due to the variability of to- pography  and  vegetation  across  a  small  (0.4  ha) study area in the Sierra Nevada of California. In gen- eral,  local  variability  will  be  greatest  in  regions where  periods  of  melting  occur  during  the  winter, where there are pronounced spatial changes in land cover  and  topography,  and  where  much  of  the  heat input to the snow is from solar radiation. Snow drift- ing  during  storms  can  produce  large  variations  in snow  depth  and  density  over  short  distances,  and variations in subsequent snow metamorphism, melt- ing, and evaporation due to local wind, temperature, radiation,  and  other  microclimatic  conditions  can further modify the distribution of these properties. Clark et al. (2011a) reviewed field studies in dif- ferent snow environments globally. They found that spatial  variability  of  SWE  is  shaped  by  several  pro- cesses that occur across a range of spatial scales. At the  watershed  scale,  spatial  variability  is  shaped  by variability  in  meteorological  factors  such  as  eleva- tional  gradients  in  temperature,  which  can  be  esti- mated  by  spatial  interpolation.  However,  spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope scale is caused by very  local  processes  such  as  drifting,  sloughing  of snow from steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and  the  unloading  of  snow  by  the  forest  canopy, which  are  more  difficult  to  resolve  explicitly.  Based on their analysis, Clark et al. (2011a) provided guid- ance  on  approaches  to  representing  these local  pro- cesses  and  on  the  suitability  of  several  common snow-modeling approaches. Mizukami  et  al.  (2011)  developed  a  simple  re- gional regression-based approach using readily avail- able  geographic  and  meteorological  parameters  as predictors  to  map  SWE  climatology  in  the  moun- tainous areas of the western United States. The spa- tial  and  temporal  resolution  of  the  analysis  was based  on  the  resolution  of  available  meteorological data,  4  km  and  1  month,  respectively.  The  method provided  reliable  predictions  from  October  to March, but broke down in April because processes at finer space and time scales affected SWE. Noting that snow-distribution patterns are simi- lar from one year to the next because they are largely controlled  by  the  interaction  of  topography,  vegeta- tion,  and  consistent  synoptic  weather  patterns, Sturm  and  Wagner  (2010)  identified  climatological snow  distribution  patterns  for  a  tundra  watershed. Using these empirically based patterns, along with a few  depth  measurements,  they  could  model  the snow-depth  distribution  as  well  or  better  than  the output from a weather-driven, physically based snow model. The distribution patterns can be captured via aerial photography or satellite remote sensing. Thus snow characteristics will be highly variable in space due largely to variations in vegetative cover, slope,  and  aspect;  consequently,  obtaining  a  repre- sentative  picture  of  the  distribution  of  snow  and snow  properties  is  important,  and  usually  difficult. Remotely  sensed  information  that  simply  identifies areas with and without snow cover can be extremely valuable in assessing the amount of water present as Chapter 5 Snow and Snowmelt snow. Peck (1997) emphasized that particular care is needed  in  obtaining  reliable  hydrometeorological measurements  in  cold  regions,  and  stressed  that  a smaller number of high-quality records may be more valuable than a larger number of records of question- able quality.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of snow accumulation and properties, how do local topography and site factors influence snow distribution?", "answer": "Local topography and site factors such as aspect (slope orientation) and vegetation cover significantly influence snow distribution. For instance, studies have shown that snow depths can vary by up to 50% due to these factors. This variability is particularly pronounced in regions where melting occurs during winter, and where there are significant spatial changes in land cover and topography."}, {"question": "Why do snow drifting and subsequent snow metamorphism contribute to large variations in snow depth and density over short distances?", "answer": "Snow drifting during storms can produce large variations in snow depth and density over short distances because it redistributes snow unevenly. Following this, variations in snow metamorphism, melting, and evaporation due to local wind, temperature, radiation, and other microclimatic conditions further modify the distribution of these properties. This process highlights the complexity of snow distribution patterns, which are shaped by a combination of meteorological factors and local site conditions."}, {"question": "In what ways can spatial variability of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) be represented, and what are the challenges in doing so?", "answer": "Spatial variability of SWE can be represented through various approaches, including spatial interpolation at the watershed scale, which accounts for elevational gradients in temperature. However, at the hillslope scale, local processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow, and trapping of snow by vegetation make it more difficult to resolve SWE variability explicitly. Researchers like Clark et al. (2011a) have provided guidance on representing these local processes, emphasizing the need for detailed, high-resolution data to accurately capture SWE variability."}, {"question": "How do researchers like Mizukami et al. (2011) approach the mapping of SWE climatology in mountainous areas, and what are the limitations of their methods?", "answer": "Researchers like Mizukami et al. (2011) have developed regional regression-based approaches using geographic and meteorological parameters to map SWE climatology. These methods can provide reliable predictions over certain periods, such as from October to March, but may break down in periods like April due to processes occurring at finer space and time scales affecting SWE.

This similarity can be utilized by identifying climatological snow distribution patterns, as demonstrated by Sturm and Wagner (2010), who used these patterns along with a few depth measurements to model snow-depth distribution effectively. This approach can be as accurate as or even surpass the output from weather-driven, physically based snow models, especially when combined with remote sensing data."}, {"question": "What role does remote sensing play in assessing snow characteristics and distribution, and why is it valuable?", "answer": "Remote sensing, through aerial photography or satellite imaging, can capture snow distribution patterns and provide valuable information on areas with and without snow cover. This information is crucial for assessing the amount of water present as snow. The simplicity of identifying snow-covered areas makes remote sensing extremely valuable, especially in regions where obtaining reliable hydrometeorological measurements is challenging, as emphasized by Peck (1997)."}, {"question": "In the context of obtaining reliable hydrometeorological measurements in cold regions, what challenges do researchers face, and how can they be addressed?", "answer": "Researchers face the challenge of ensuring the quality of hydrometeorological measurements in cold regions, where conditions can be harsh and variable. Peck (1997) stressed the importance of particular care in obtaining these measurements, suggesting that a smaller number of high-quality records may be more valuable than a larger number of records of questionable quality. This underscores the need for rigorous measurement protocols and potentially the use of remote sensing technologies to supplement ground-based data."}, {"question": "How do meteorological factors such as temperature and solar radiation influence the distribution of snow properties, and what are the implications for snow modeling?", "answer": "Meteorological factors like temperature and solar radiation significantly influence the distribution of snow properties by affecting processes such as melting, evaporation, and metamorphism. These factors, combined with local topography and vegetation, shape the spatial variability of snow water equivalent (SWE) and other snow properties. Understanding these influences is crucial for accurate snow modeling, as it allows for the representation of complex snow distribution patterns and the prediction of snowmelt, which is essential for hydrological forecasting and water resource management."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.4.1 Effects of Elevation and Aspect Because of  the  general  decrease of  air  tempera- ture with altitude (figure 2.2), the amount and frac- tion  of  precipitation  falling  as  snow  are  usually strong functions of elevation in a region (figure 5.12). Rates of increase of SWE with elevation vary region- ally  and  with  local  factors  such  as  aspect,  and  may vary from year to year at a given location.

{"paragraph": "5.4.2 Effects of Vegetation The accumulation of precipitation on the leaves and  branches  of  vegetation  is  called canopy  inter- ception.  Some  intercepted  snow  eventually  falls  to the  ground  either  before  or  after  melting  and  is added  to  the  snowpack;  the  rest  evaporates  and  is called canopy interception loss.2 Deciduous trees in- tercept less snow than do conifers, and various coni- fer  species  differ  in  their  capture  of  snow.  Schmidt and  Gluns  (1991)  found  that  (1)  individual  conifer branches  intercepted  11  to  80%  of  SWE  in  22 storms, (2) the fraction intercepted was inversely re- lated  to  snow  density  and  to  total  storm  precipita- tion,  and  (3)  the  maximum  intercepted  water equivalent  was  about  7  mm.

In a study in New Mexico, Veatch et al. (2009) found that SWE is significantly correlated with can- opy density and that maximum snow accumulation occurred in forests with canopy densities between 25 and  40%.  Forest  edges  affected  snow  depth,  with clearings  shaded  by  forest  to  their  immediate  south having ~25% deeper snow than either large open ar- eas or densely forested areas. Forest  clearings  disrupt  the  typical  upward-in- creasing  wind  velocities  above  a  canopy  (section 3.5.2)  and  affect  snow  deposition.  Accumulation tends to be greater in small clearings (i.e., those with diameters less than 20 times the height of surround- ing trees) than in the surrounding forest, but the pat- tern  is  typically  reversed  in  larger  clearings  because wind speed tends to be higher, blowing snow into the surrounding forest and causing higher evaporation in the  clearing  (Golding  and  Swanson  1986).  Water- shed-scale experiments have shown that tree harvest- ing  tends  to  increase  SWE  and  snowmelt  runoff (Schmidt and Troendle 1989). This increase is attrib- uted to a reduction in the evaporation of intercepted snow  and  increased  snow  deposition  into  clearings and thinned forests, which is only partially offset by increased evaporation from the ground snowpack. Figure  5.13  on  the  following  page  shows  the variability of seasonal peak depth, density, and SWE on  a  range  of  vegetation  types  in  Ontario,  Canada. Overall these observations are consistent with those just described for forest clearings: the highest depths and  water  equivalents  were  in  an  open  forest  with shrub understory (vegetation zone B), and the lowest values  were  in  areas  without  forest  cover,  including grass (vegetation zone A) and marsh (Adams 1976). Density  tended  to  vary  little  with  land-cover  type. Note  also  that  there  was  considerable  year-to-year variability in the relative values. Varhola  et  al.  (2010)  reviewed  studies  of  the overall effects of forest cover on snow accumulation and melt rates at 65 locations, mostly in the United States  and  Canada.  They  were  able  to  summarize the results in two simple empirical relations between fractional changes in forest cover, ΔF, and fractional changes  in  seasonal  accumulation,  and  melt rates, ΔM: ΔAcc = –0.40 · ΔF, ΔM = –0.53 · ΔF. Chapter 5 Snow and Snowmelt The negative relation in accumulation is attributed to increased sublimation of snow intercepted in the for- est  canopy;  the  negative  relation  in  melt  rates  is largely due to the effects of shading in reducing en- ergy flux from solar radiation. They noted that there was  considerable  scatter  around  these  relations  due to local conditions. On a very local scale, Woo and Steer (1986) pre- sented data on variations of snow depth around indi- vidual  trees  in  a  subarctic  spruce  forest  in  northern Ontario. The data were used along with information on  tree  spacing  to  compute  average  snow  depth  for the forest. As shown in figure 5.14, depth increases away from the trunk and reaches the clearing value at a distance of 2 to 4 m from the tree. Presumably, this pattern is produced by snow interception and by added  heat  inputs  due  to  longwave  radiation  from the  tree  trunk,  which  can  accelerate  the  processes that increase snow density and produce melt.

This process is influenced by the type of vegetation, with deciduous trees intercepting less snow than conifers. The amount of snow intercepted also depends on snow density and total storm precipitation, with a maximum intercepted water equivalent of about 7 mm found in one study."}, {"question": "Why do forest edges and clearings impact snow depth and accumulation differently compared to densely forested areas?", "answer": "Forest edges and clearings affect snow depth and accumulation due to disruptions in wind velocities and patterns. In small clearings, snow accumulation tends to be greater than in the surrounding forest, but this pattern reverses in larger clearings where higher wind speeds can blow snow into the surrounding forest, leading to higher evaporation in the clearing. This variability is attributed to the changes in wind speed and direction caused by the presence of trees and the size of the clearing."}, {"question": "In what ways does the density of forest canopy influence snow accumulation and melt rates, and what empirical relations have been derived from studies?", "answer": "The density of the forest canopy influences snow accumulation and melt rates by affecting sublimation and shading. Studies have shown that fractional changes in forest cover (ΔF) are related to fractional changes in seasonal accumulation (ΔAcc) and melt rates (ΔM) through the empirical relations ΔAcc = –0.40 · ΔF and ΔM = –0.53 · ΔF. These relations indicate that increases in forest cover lead to decreases in snow accumulation and melt rates, primarily due to increased sublimation of intercepted snow and reduced energy flux from solar radiation due to shading."}, {"question": "How does tree harvesting impact snow accumulation and melt runoff, and what are the underlying mechanisms for these changes?", "answer": "Tree harvesting tends to increase snow accumulation and melt runoff. This increase is attributed to a reduction in the evaporation of intercepted snow and increased snow deposition into clearings and thinned forests. Although there is some offset by increased evaporation from the ground snowpack, the overall effect is an increase in snow accumulation and melt runoff. This is because the removal of trees reduces the canopy interception loss, allowing more snow to reach the ground, and the creation of clearings can lead to increased snow deposition due to changes in wind patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of snow depth around individual trees, what pattern has been observed, and how can this pattern be explained?", "answer": "Around individual trees, snow depth has been observed to increase with distance from the trunk, reaching the clearing value at a distance of 2 to 4 meters from the tree. This pattern can be explained by snow interception by the tree and the added heat inputs due to longwave radiation from the tree trunk, which can accelerate processes that increase snow density and produce melt. The proximity to the tree influences the local microclimate, affecting how snow accumulates and melts."}, {"question": "Why do studies on the effects of forest cover on snow accumulation and melt rates show considerable scatter around empirical relations?", "answer": "The considerable scatter around empirical relations between fractional changes in forest cover and changes in snow accumulation and melt rates is due to local conditions. These conditions can include variations in vegetation type, climate, topography, and other factors that influence snowfall, accumulation, and melt. The empirical relations provide a general framework for understanding the impact of forest cover on snow processes but do not capture the full complexity of local variability."}, {"question": "In what ways can the type of vegetation cover influence the peak snowpack variability, and what has been observed in studies comparing different vegetation zones?", "answer": "The type of vegetation cover can influence peak snowpack variability by affecting snow accumulation and melt rates. Studies have shown that different vegetation zones can have significantly different snow depths and water equivalents. For example, open forests with shrub understory have been found to have higher snow depths and water equivalents compared to areas without forest cover, such as grasslands or marshes. The density of the vegetation cover, such as canopy density, also plays a role, with maximum snow accumulation often occurring in forests with moderate canopy densities."}, {"question": "How does the size of forest clearings impact snow accumulation, and what are the implications for snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "The size of forest clearings impacts snow accumulation, with small clearings (less than 20 times the height of surrounding trees) typically having greater snow accumulation than larger clearings. This is because small clearings disrupt wind patterns less, allowing for more snow to accumulate, whereas larger clearings can lead to increased wind speeds that blow snow into the surrounding forest, reducing accumulation. The implications for snowmelt runoff are significant, as changes in snow accumulation patterns due to forest clearing size can affect the timing and magnitude of runoff, influencing downstream water"}]}

{"paragraph": "5.5.1 The Snowpack Energy Balance The energy balance for the snowpack element of figure 5.5 is [E L–2 T–1] is the rate at which energy be- comes  available  for  snowmelt,    is  the  net  flux  of energy [E L–2 T–1] from the atmosphere and ground, and ΔU/Δt is the change in internal energy (tempera- ture)  in  time  period  The  components  of  the  en- ergy flux are where K is net shortwave (solar) radiation flux, L is flux, λE is net  longwave  radiation  net  flux  of  latent heat from the atmosphere via turbulent diffusion, H is net flux of sensible heat from the atmosphere via turbulent  diffusion,  R  is  flux  of  sensible  heat  from rain,  and G  is  the  net  flux  of  sensible  heat  via  con- duction with the ground. A seasonal snowpack begins to form when aver- age air temperatures are more or less continually be- low 0°C. As the snowpack accumulates, net inputs of energy  from  the  atmosphere  are  generally  negative, average snowpack temperature decreases, and water equivalent typically increases. The period of general increase  of  snowpack  water  equivalent  prior  to  the melt  period  is  called  the  period.  The accumulation melt period of a seasonal snowpack begins when the net input of energy becomes more or less continually positive.  The  melt  period  can  usually  be  separated into three phases:3 1. Warming phase, during which the average snow- pack  temperature  increases  more  or  less  steadily until the snowpack is isothermal at 0°C. 2.

In  most  situations,  the  snowpack  does  not  prog- ress steadily through this sequence: Some melting usu- ally occurs at the surface of a snowpack from time to time prior to the ripening phase, when air temperature rises above 0°C for periods of hours or days. The melt- water thus produced percolates into the cold snow at depth and refreezes, releasing latent heat, which raises the snow temperature. Similarly, snow-surface temper- atures may fall below freezing during the melt period, and the surface layer must warm again before melting can  continue.  Even  where  daytime  temperatures  are continuously above freezing, temperatures commonly fall below 0°C at night and it may take several hours for  the  snowpack  to  warm  and  resume  melting  each day (Bengtsson 1982; Tseng et al. 1994).

The warming phase is characterized by a steady increase in snowpack temperature until it reaches 0°C. The ripening phase involves melting with the retention of meltwater within the snowpack until it becomes isothermal and saturated.

This results in a non-steady progression through the melt phases, with melting occurring in pulses rather than continuously.

These obser- vations can be used to estimate the effect of cloud cover using empirical relations such as (Croley  1989).  In  snow  studies,  the  US  Army Corps  of  Engineers  (1956)  used  a  relation  involv- ing cloud height: where Z  is cloud-base height in meters. However, manual  observations  of  C  are  no  longer  being made in the United States because human weather observers are being replaced by automated stations (ASOS; box 4.4).

As it passes through the atmosphere, the energy in the solar beam is diminished by absorption and reflectance (scat- tering) by atmospheric gases and aerosols, reflection and absorption by clouds, and shading by vegetation. Estimation  based  on  “percent  possible  sun- shine”: Where available, daily observations of the fraction  of  daylight  hours  receiving  bright  sun- shine, S, have been used to estimate insolation via nomographs (Hamon et al. 1954), or empirical for- mulas such as = k  + k where 0.18 ≤ k  ≤ 0.40 and 0.42 ≤ k  ≤ 0.56 (Gray and  Prowse  1992);  Shuttleworth  (1992)  recom- mended using k  = 0.25 and k  = 0.50. Daily obser- vations of S have been made at some US weather stations, but the availability of these is decreasing as stations become automated (Lindsey and Farn- sworth 1997). Estimation  based  on  maximum  and  minimum precipitation:  Daily  tempera- temperature  and ture  range  tends  to  be  inversely  related  to  cloud cover, and there have been several attempts to use this  relation  to  develop  empirical  relations between  insolation  and  daily  temperature  range.

{"paragraph": "5.5.2.1.5 Albedo The  physics  of  reflection  are  complicated  (see, for example, Melloh et al. 2002; Yasunari et al. 2011); snow-surface  albedo  depends  on  wavelength,  snow depth, grain size and shape, liquid-water content, sun angle, and impurities (Gardner and Sharp 2010). Its value ranges from about 0.2 to 0.9, and is thus an im- portant determinant of the net input of energy to the snowpack. Albedo generally decreases with the age of the snow surface (time since last snowfall) as density, grain size, and liquid-water content increase and im- purities accumulate (figure 5.22b). Because of the porous nature of snow, solar radi- ation is reflected not at the surface plane, but over a finite depth. There is little penetration of solar radia- tion below about 10 cm, so figure 5.22a applies only when    >  10  cm.  For  shallower  snowpacks,  signifi- cant amounts of radiation are absorbed by the ground and may heat the snow from below. Leonard and Es- chner (1968) found that albedo measured for snow in- tercepted on a conifer forest was considerably lower (a  ≈  0.2)  than  for  a  ground  snowpack,  resulting  in more rapid melting and greater evaporation for inter- cepted snow. α = 180° Latitude = 45°", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of snow-surface albedo, what factors influence its value?", "answer": "Snow-surface albedo depends on wavelength, snow depth, grain size and shape, liquid-water content, sun angle, and impurities."}, {"question": "How does the age of the snow surface affect its albedo?", "answer": "The albedo generally decreases with the age of the snow surface as density, grain size, and liquid-water content increase and impurities accumulate."}, {"question": "In the context of solar radiation and snowpack, why is there little penetration of solar radiation below about 10 cm?", "answer": "Because of the porous nature of snow, solar radiation is reflected not at the surface plane, but over a finite depth, resulting in little penetration below about 10 cm.

The variability in albedo values underscores the complexity of snow-surface interactions with solar radiation and the need to consider these dynamics in hydrological and climatological studies."}, {"question": "How does the presence of impurities in snow affect its albedo?", "answer": "The presence of impurities in snow, which increases with the age of the snow surface, contributes to a decrease in its albedo. As impurities accumulate, they absorb more solar radiation, reducing the amount of radiation reflected by the snow surface. This decrease in albedo can lead to increased energy absorption by the snowpack, potentially accelerating its melting."}, {"question": "In the context of snowpack energy balance, why is it essential to consider the albedo of the snow surface?", "answer": "Considering the albedo of the snow surface is essential for understanding the snowpack's energy balance because it directly affects the amount of solar radiation absorbed versus reflected.

Accurate estimation of albedo is thus critical for predicting snowmelt and its hydrological implications."}, {"question": "What challenges does the complexity of snow-surface albedo pose for hydrological modeling?", "answer": "The complexity of snow-surface albedo, influenced by multiple factors such as wavelength, snow depth, grain size, and impurities, poses significant challenges for hydrological modeling. These complexities require detailed understanding and accurate parameterization of albedo in models to predict snowpack behavior and its hydrological consequences accurately. The variability and dynamic nature of albedo add to the challenge, necessitating continuous monitoring and updating of model parameters to reflect changing snow conditions.

{"paragraph": "5.5.2.3 Turbulent Exchange of Sensible Heat The  physics  of  turbulent  exchange  of  sensible heat  were  developed  in  section  3.5.3.6.  Combining equations (3.54) and (3.55) gives the flux of sensible heat from the atmosphere into a snowpack, H [E L–2 T–1], as ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ a p m m ss is the density of air (≈ 1.292 kg/m3), where κ = 0.4, ρ is the measurement height above the snow surface, is the zero-plane displacement height, z  is the sur- the air temperature, and T  is the surface temperature. To modify this equation for snow, we can assume that    is  negligibly  small.  The  roughness  height,  , depends on the irregularity of the snow surface, and so can be highly variable from place to place and with time  at  a  given  location.  For  example,  Anderson (1976) measured values between 0.0001 and 0.038 m for  his  research  site  in  Vermont.  However,  his  data show a strong decrease in z  as the season progressed, and  values  during  the  melt  season  did  not  exceed 0.005 m. In the absence of other information, a value between  0.0005  and 0.005  m may be selected; how- ever,  it  should  be  noted  that  for  special  situations, such as vegetation projecting above the snow surface or patchy snow, z  could be considerably higher. Assuming  that  is  a  standard  measurement = 0.001005 MJ/kg · K, ρ so that with c  = 1.29 kg/ m3, and z = 0.002 m, equation (5.52) becomes · (T  – T ) MJ/m2 · d H = 0.372 · u  · (T  – T where u  is in m/s and temperatures are in °C. Equa- tion (5.53) is analogous to equation (3.55). There are two additional considerations in the ap- plication  of  equations  (5.52)  and  (5.53).  First,  as  ex- plained in section 3.5.3.7, those equations apply strictly to  conditions  of  neutral  atmospheric  stability,  i.e., when  the  actual  temperature  gradient  in  the  air  near the surface equals the adiabatic lapse rate. When warm air overlies a snowpack, the actual lapse rate is typically less steep than adiabatic and temperatures may even in- crease  with  elevation  (a  “temperature  inversion”),  so stable  conditions  exist  that  tend  to  suppress  turbulent exchange  (see  figure  3.13).  To  account  for  this,  the value of H can be adjusted, as explained in box 3.2. The second consideration in applying equations (5.52) and (5.53) is that wind speeds are virtually al- ways measured in fields or clearings, and such mea- surements must be adjusted for calculating turbulent exchange in forested areas.

If the vapor-pressure gradient is directed upward tent heat will be lost; if directed downward [e(z ) > ] condensation occurs along with an input of latent heat.  In  applying  this  equation  to  snow  two  phase changes may be involved: For cold snowpacks [T(0) <  0°C],  evaporation  and  condensation  involve  the solid-vapor  or  vapor-solid  phase  change  (sublima- tion) and the latent heat involved is the sum of the la- tent heats of vaporization, λ , and fusion, λ , so λ = solid-liquid or liquid-solid phase change occurs and is involved.

Ignoring these effects can lead to inaccuracies in estimating snow ablation and melt rates, which are critical for water resource management and hydrological forecasting in forested catchments."}, {"question": "How do the equations (5.56) and (5.57) for latent heat exchange differ for cold snowpacks and melting snow?", "answer": "Equations (5.56) and (5.57) differ in the numerical coefficients and the vapor pressure terms, reflecting the different phase changes and latent heats involved in cold snowpacks (sublimation) and melting snow (solid-liquid phase change).

H  was  positive and LE negative in all accumulation seasons, but the magnitude  of  H  was  several  times  greater  than  that of LE, so there was a net input of heat from turbulent exchange. There was a very small contribution from rain. The overall positive net input is largely due to ground heat, which was sufficient to produce about 87 mm of groundmelt. In  all  melt  seasons,  the  input  from  K  was  about twice the loss via L, resulting in a strongly positive net radiation. This was augmented slightly by G and negli- gibly by R.

These factors contributed to the increase in snowpack density from about 100 to 150 kg/m3 to about 300 kg/m3 when the melt season began.

In contrast, during the melt seasons, the input from K was about twice the loss via L, resulting in a strongly positive net radiation, which was augmented by G and slightly by R, leading to a positive net heat input used in melting."}, {"question": "Why did the snowpack density increase during the accumulation period, and what were the implications for the melt season?", "answer": "The snowpack density increased due to constructive metamorphism and occasionally to refreezing at depth of rain and surface melt. This increase in density had implications for the melt season, as it affected the water equivalent and the timing of the melt. The density increase to about 300 kg/m3 by the start of the melt season meant that the snowpack was more resistant to melting, requiring more energy to melt the same amount of snow compared to less dense snow."}, {"question": "In the context of the energy budget during the melt period, what role did turbulent exchange processes play, and how did they contribute to the net heat input?", "answer": "Turbulent exchange processes, including sensible heat exchange (H) and latent heat exchange (LE), played a significant role in the energy budget during the melt period. Although LE was negative, indicating a loss of energy, H was positive and of a larger magnitude, resulting in a net input from turbulent exchange processes. This net input contributed to the overall positive net heat input for the melt seasons, which was used in melting the snowpack."}, {"question": "What were the key differences in the components of the energy budget between the accumulation and melt seasons, and how did these differences impact the net heat input?", "answer": "The key differences in the components of the energy budget between the accumulation and melt seasons included the sign and magnitude of net radiation (K + L), the contribution from ground heat (G), and the relative importance of sensible and latent heat exchange. During accumulation, net radiation was negative, and ground heat provided a significant positive input, while during melt, net radiation was positive and dominant. These differences led to a negative net heat input during accumulation, which was largely due to ground heat, and a positive net heat input during melt, which was primarily due to net radiation and turbulent exchange."}, {"question": "How did the air temperature influence the snowmelt process, and what were the critical temperature thresholds for the onset of melting?", "answer": "Air temperature played a crucial role in the snowmelt process, with the accumulation period ending when air temperature began a final rise above 0°C.

The implications of this density fluctuation for the melting process included changes in the water equivalent and the rate of melting, as denser snow requires more energy to melt than less dense snow."}, {"question": "What were the contributions of ground heat and rain to the energy budget during the accumulation and melt seasons, and how did these contributions impact the net heat input?", "answer": "Ground heat provided a significant positive contribution to the energy budget during the accumulation season, sufficient to produce about 87 mm of groundmelt, while rain contributed negligibly.

As can be seen in tables 5.4– 5.6,  the  heat  introduced  by  the  rain  plays  only  a small role in generating melt; but in some cases the rain itself, with little melt, can produce floods (Singh et al. 1997). One severe flooding case in which melt due to so- lar radiation did play a large role was that of the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in the spring of  1997.  The  watershed  of  the  Red  River  is  flat  and largely unforested; the flood severity was exacerbated because of a record snowpack, the fact that the river flows northward, and the interruption of the melt sea- son by a major blizzard (Macek-Rowland 1997).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of snowmelt energy balances, what role do net radiation and turbulent exchange play?", "answer": "Net radiation and turbulent exchange play a major role in the energy balance during snowmelt, with net radiation being the most important component in forests due to less-negative or positive longwave radiation and reduced wind speeds."}, {"question": "How do humidity and wind conditions affect latent-heat exchange during snowmelt?", "answer": "Latent-heat exchange is positive in some places but negative in others, likely due to contrasting humidity and wind conditions. This variability suggests that local environmental factors significantly influence the energy balance during snowmelt. For instance, high humidity and wind can lead to positive latent-heat exchange, while dry and calm conditions may result in negative latent-heat exchange."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt flooding, why is the potential for flooding high when warm, humid air and high winds occur over a ripe snowpack?", "answer": "The potential for flooding is high under these conditions because the situation typically exists over a watershed, leading to widespread snowmelt. Unlike solar radiation, which is largely restricted to south-facing, non-forested slopes, warm, humid air and high winds can cause rapid melting across the entire watershed, resulting in a significant increase in runoff and flooding potential. Furthermore, when rain accompanies warm winds, the flooding potential may be further exacerbated, producing a \"rain-on-snow event\" that can lead to severe flooding."}, {"question": "What is the significance of \"rain-on-snow events\" in the context of snowmelt flooding, and how do they contribute to flooding?", "answer": "\"Rain-on-snow events\" occur when rain falls on a ripe snowpack, often accompanied by warm winds, leading to rapid snowmelt and increased runoff. These events can significantly contribute to flooding, as the rain itself, with little melt, can produce floods. The combination of rain and snowmelt can exacerbate the flooding potential, as seen in the record floods of March 1936 in central New England. The heat introduced by the rain plays a relatively small role in generating melt, but the rain can still produce significant flooding, especially when combined with snowmelt."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt energy balances, how do cloudy or rainy days affect the dominant energy exchange process?", "answer": "On cloudy or rainy days, turbulent exchange of latent heat dominates the energy balance. This shift in dominant energy exchange process is likely due to the reduced net radiation on cloudy days, allowing turbulent exchange to become the primary mechanism driving snowmelt."}, {"question": "Why is the Red River watershed in North Dakota and Minnesota prone to severe flooding during snowmelt, and what factors contribute to the flood severity?", "answer": "The Red River watershed is prone to severe flooding due to its flat and largely unforested terrain, which allows for rapid snowmelt across the watershed. The flood severity is exacerbated by factors such as a record snowpack, the river's northward flow, and the interruption of the melt season by major blizzards. These factors contribute to a significant increase in runoff and flooding potential, as seen in the severe flooding event in the spring of 1997. The combination of these factors highlights the importance of considering local topography, climate, and weather patterns when assessing flood risk in snowmelt-dominated watersheds."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt, how do forests influence the energy balance, and what are the implications for snowmelt rates?", "answer": "Forests influence the energy balance by reducing wind speeds and having less-negative or positive longwave radiation, making net radiation the most important component in the energy balance. This can lead to higher snowmelt rates in forests compared to non-forested areas, as the reduced wind speeds and increased net radiation can enhance the energy available for snowmelt. However, the implications of this on snowmelt rates can vary depending on local conditions, such as the density of the forest and the amount of solar radiation that reaches the snow surface."}, {"question": "What are the implications of very high areal snowmelt rates for snowmelt flooding, and how can they be forecasted?", "answer": "Very high areal snowmelt rates can lead to significant flooding, as they result in a rapid increase in runoff. These high snowmelt rates are often caused by intense positive turbulent heat exchange under humid, windy, and warm conditions. Forecasting these events is crucial for mitigating flood risk, and can be done by monitoring weather patterns, such as the approach of warm, humid air and high winds, and assessing the ripeness of the snowpack. By understanding the factors that contribute to high snowmelt rates, forecasters can provide early warnings for potential flooding events, allowing for timely evacuation and flood mitigation measures."}]}
{"paragraph": "5.6 Snowmelt Runoff Generation We saw earlier that a ripe snowpack typically re- tains only a small fraction of its water equivalent as liquid  water,  which  is  present  as  thin  films  held  by surface tension occupying less than 10% of the pore Figure 5.24 Contour plot showing cross section of snow wetness (θ) to a depth of 80 cm over 5-m wide areas across a slope in the Swiss Alps in the early stages of snowmelt [Techel and Pielmeier (2011)]. Chapter 5 Snow and Snowmelt space (figures 5.15 and 5.16). As additional water is produced during the last phase of melting it can no longer be held against gravity, and downward perco- lation begins. Natural snowpacks are seldom homo- geneous, and usually contain discontinuous layers of varying  density  that  temporarily  store  and  horizon- tally  divert  the  percolating  water  (Marsh  and  Woo 1985;  Conway  and  Benedict  1994;  Hirashima  et  al. 2010). Figure 5.24 shows that the distribution of liq- uid water in a melting snowpack is far from uniform vertically or horizontally. However, ice layers usually disappear as melt progresses, and melting snowpacks tend to become fairly uniform assemblages of quasi- spherical grains of 1 to 3 mm diameter. Thus to gain a  basic  understanding  of  the  physical  processes  in- volved  we  can  treat  melting  snowpacks  as media,  physically  identical  to  coarse- neous  porous grained soils. Water arriving at the bottom of the snowpack in- filtrates  into  the  soil  and/or  accumulates  to  form  a saturated zone at the base of the snowpack, moving toward  a  surface-water  body  by  one  of  the  paths  il- lustrated in figure 5.25. In figure 5.25a, the water ta- ble  is  at  depth  and  the  ground  above  it  is unsaturated, so all of the water output infiltrates and moves  streamward  as  subsurface  flow.  In  figure 5.25b, the infiltration rate is less than the water-out- put  rate,  so  a  basal  saturated  zone  develops  within the snowpack through which water flows toward the stream. In figure 5.25c, ground conditions are simi- Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange lar  to  those  of  5.25a,  but  the  water  table  has  risen above  the  ground  surface  on  the  lower  part  of  the slope  so  that  water  moves  streamward  by  both  sur- face and subsurface routes. The  process  of  infiltration  will  be  discussed  in detail  in  chapter  8,  and  runoff  generation  by  pro- cesses similar to those shown in figure 5.25c will be examined in chapter 10.

This scenario highlights the importance of considering groundwater dynamics in understanding snowmelt runoff. Furthermore, it implies that the interaction between the snowpack, soil, and groundwater can significantly influence the pathways and timing of water movement, affecting the overall hydrological response of the system."}, {"question": "Why is it reasonable to treat melting snowpacks as media physically identical to coarse-grained porous soils for the purpose of understanding the physical processes involved?", "answer": "It is reasonable to treat melting snowpacks as media physically identical to coarse-grained porous soils because, as melting progresses, snowpacks tend to become fairly uniform assemblages of quasi-spherical grains, similar to those found in coarse-grained soils. This similarity in structure allows for the application of principles and models developed for porous media to the study of snowmelt runoff generation, simplifying the analysis of complex hydrological processes.

These layers can act as barriers or conduits, affecting the timing and pathways of water movement and, consequently, the generation of runoff.

These factors interact to determine the pathways and timing of water movement, with significant implications for runoff generation and the overall hydrological response of the system.

{"paragraph": "5.6.1 Flow in the Unsaturated Zone Above  any  basal  saturated  zone,  which  may form where meltwater accumulates at an ice layer or at  the  ground  surface,  the  pores  of  snowpacks  are only partially filled with liquid water.

Because  of  the  relatively  large  grain  sizes,  sur- face-tension forces in snow are usually negligible in relation to gravitational forces. Thus Darcy’s law can be simplified to where q  is the downward vertical flux rate (volume of water per unit horizontal area per unit time [L T–1]) and    is  the unsaturated  hydraulic  conductivity of the snow [L T–1]. As in soils, unsaturated hydrau- lic  conductivity  is  a  function  of  the saturated  con- ductivity,  ,  and  the  degree  to  which  the  pores contain water; where S is the fraction of pore space containing mo- bile water, and the exponent has been found experimentally to be c ≈ 3.

Thus  the rate  of  meltwater  production  (assumed  to  originate at the surface) varies continually. This variation gen- erates a daily wave of meltwater originating near the surface and percolating downward (figure 5.27). We designate  the  melt  rate  at  any  instant  (t),  and  a given melt rate travels vertically downward at a rate dt f (1 - q )¯ Because the speed of these melt waves increases as  the  melt  rate  increases,  percolating  water  pro- duced  during  the  period  of  peak  melting  near  mid- day  overtakes  water  produced  earlier  in  the  day. Thus  the  waves  tend  to  accumulate  water  and  de- velop a sharp wave front, as in figures 5.27 and 5.28. Equation  (5.65)  can  be  integrated  to  show  that  the depth  of  penetration,  z,  of  a  flux  of  meltwater  with constant flux rate is linearly related to time t: An example calculation of the travel time of wa- ter generated at a particular melt rate is given in box 5.3 on p. 243. To illustrate the overall melt-percola- tion phenomenon, we use the results of Dunne et al.

This simplification allows for the use of a modified version of Darcy's law, where the downward vertical flux rate (q) is related to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the snow."}, {"question": "In the unsaturated zone of a snowpack, why does the speed of meltwater waves increase as the melt rate increases?", "answer": "The speed of meltwater waves increases as the melt rate increases because the percolating water produced during the period of peak melting near mid-day overtakes water produced earlier in the day, causing the waves to accumulate water and develop a sharp wave front. This phenomenon is a result of the variation in meltwater production, which generates a daily wave of meltwater originating near the surface and percolating downward.

The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the saturated conductivity, the degree to which the pores contain water, and the snow density and grain size. Specifically, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be estimated using an equation that takes into account the snow density and grain size, allowing for the calculation of the percolation velocity of water generated at a particular melt rate."}, {"question": "Why do faster-moving waves overtake earlier-generated slower waves to form a shock front in the snowpack, and what are the implications for runoff generation?", "answer": "Faster-moving waves overtake earlier-generated slower waves to form a shock front in the snowpack because the speed of meltwater waves increases as the melt rate increases. This phenomenon leads to the accumulation of water and the development of a sharp wave front, which travels at an intermediate speed. The formation of a shock front has significant implications for runoff generation, as it affects the timing and magnitude of peak flow from the snowpack. The shock front can lead to a rapid increase in runoff, as the accumulated water is released from the snowpack, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of snowmelt percolation in predicting runoff generation."}]}

This input produces daily waves that travel downslope in the basal saturated zone at a velocity, U , where is  the  saturated  hydraulic  conductivity  of  the basal snow layer, and β is the slope angle. K is esti- mated  via  equation  (5.63).  However,  it  should  be noted  that  the  size  of  snow  grains  in  the  saturated zone can be significantly larger than that in the un- saturated  zone  due  to  more  rapid  metamorphism: For a subarctic snowpack, Dunne et al.

Using the wave velocity U , one can calculate the average time of travel of water in the basal saturated zone, t , as where X is the slope length. t  is typically on the or- der of 1% of the travel time through the unsaturated zone (Male and Gray 1981).

{"paragraph": "5.7.2.1 Energy-Balance Approach The energy-balance relations discussed in section 5.5  form  the  basis  for  one  class  of  models  of  snow- melt at a point. These models are often characterized as “physically based” because the energy balance is a fundamental  physical  principle  (conservation  of  en- ergy)  and  because  they  use  equations  that  describe the physics of processes in each component of the en- ergy balance. However, different models use different representations of these processes, which may be sim- pler  or  more  complex  than  described  in  section  5.5. For  example,  some  models  may  consider  the  visible and near-infrared portions of the solar spectrum sepa- rately,  use  different  ways  of  characterizing  forest  ef- fects on wind and/or snow interception, and consider different  layers  within  the  snowpack.  Furthermore, the processes can be modeled at different spatial and temporal  discretizations;  for  example,  the  JULES model described by Parajka et al. (2010a) operates at an hourly time step and a spatial resolution of 25 km × 25 km, and each grid cell contains a variable frac- tion  of  nine  surface-vegetation  types,  each  of  which can be set to have different properties. Anderson (1976) made a thorough and extensive study  and  testing  of  point  snowmelt-modeling  tech- niques in a large clearing at an elevation of 550 m in Danville,  Vermont,  over  a  period  of  six  years.  He found  only  minor  differences  in  results  using  time steps of  1,  3, and 6 hr.  Maximum time steps should probably  not  exceed  12  hr  in  order  to  capture  the drastic differences between daytime and nighttime en- ergy balances. Anderson (1976) also compared model results using snowpack-depth increments of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 cm, and found that predicted water equivalent at  a  given  time  increased  as  the  thickness  increased because  the  thicker  layers  introduced  distortions  in the diurnal warming-cooling cycles. Although there is little  further  evidence  on  which  to  base  definitive guidelines, one could probably expect significant dis- tortions  to  appear  in  energy-balance  models  using thicknesses exceeding 50 to 100 cm.

For example, using a coarse spatial resolution may not adequately resolve the effects of topography, vegetation, and other landscape features on snowmelt, while using a long time step may not capture the diurnal cycles of energy balance.

This can have significant implications for water resource management, as inaccurate predictions can lead to poor decision-making regarding water allocation, flood control, and other hydrological applications. Furthermore, the use of generalized approaches can also limit the ability to account for local factors that influence snowmelt, such as forest cover and slope inclination, which can further reduce the accuracy of snowmelt predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of temperature-index snowmelt modeling, how does the base temperature affect the estimation of snowmelt?", "answer": "The base temperature, typically set at 0°C (the melting point), affects the estimation of snowmelt by serving as a threshold below which no snowmelt occurs. This means that if the air temperature is below the base temperature, the model predicts no snowmelt, regardless of other conditions. The choice of base temperature is critical because it influences the accuracy of snowmelt predictions, especially in regions where the snow-surface temperature may deviate from 0°C during melting."}, {"question": "Why is the temperature-index approach still used despite the increasing availability of computational resources?", "answer": "The temperature-index approach is still used because, despite the increasing availability of computational resources, it remains a simple and effective method for estimating snowmelt, especially in situations where detailed data for energy-balance computations are lacking. Its simplicity and the fact that it can provide reasonable estimates of snowmelt with minimal data requirements make it a practical choice for many applications, particularly in regions with limited resources or data availability. Additionally, the ongoing development of generalized approaches to estimating the melt coefficient, M, continues to improve the accuracy and applicability of the temperature-index approach."}, {"question": "In the context of snowmelt modeling, what is the relationship between air temperature and energy inputs from longwave radiation and turbulent exchange?", "answer": "According to the paragraph, energy inputs from longwave radiation and turbulent exchange are approximately linear functions of air temperature. This relationship is a key justification for the temperature-index approach, as it allows for the simplification of complex energy balance calculations into a linear function of air temperature, making the model more tractable and easier to apply in a variety of situations."}, {"question": "How does the correlation between insolation and air temperature influence the temperature-index approach?", "answer": "The general correlation between insolation and air temperature provides further justification for the temperature-index approach. This correlation suggests that air temperature can serve as a proxy for the energy available for snowmelt, including both direct solar radiation (insolation) and other energy"}]}

Figure  5.32  compares  snow- course  measurements  of  snowpack  water  equivalent and  density  with  values  simulated  by  Anderson’s complete energy-balance model for the accumulation season  and  the  warming and ripening  phases of  the melt  season  in  1972–1973.  Figure  5.33  shows  the same comparison for the output phase, and includes the  predictions  of  the  temperature-index  model. Computed daily water output is compared with val- ues  measured  in  a  lysimeter  in  figure  5.34.  Clearly, both models perform very well in simulating density and water equivalent for the 1972–1973 snow season; this was true also in 1971–1972.

The hybrid approach predicted daily runoff better in only  two  of  the  six  years,  but  predicted  total runoff volume significantly better in all years. Kustas et al. (1994) compared lysimeter-measured snowmelt with melt estimated via (1) a complete en- ergy balance, (2) the temperature-index approach with a  seasonally  increasing  melt  coefficient,  and  (3)  the hybrid approach with radiation terms estimated as in sections 5.5.2.1 and 5.5.2.2 for a research site in Swit- zerland  (figure  5.36  on  p.  250).  The  accuracy  of  the hybrid  approach  was  almost  identical  to  that  of  the complete energy balance, and both were considerably better than the temperature-index estimates. Anderson  (1976)  concluded  that  in  heavily  for- ested watersheds, a temperature-index model that in- cludes a way to account for decreases in areal snow cover  during  melt  should  give  results  similar  to  an energy-balance  model.

Energy-balance models, like Anderson's complete model, simulate snowpack settling, compaction, and energy balance, making them applicable for both accumulation and melt seasons. In contrast, temperature-index models, such as the one calibrated for the Danville site, are typically used only for the output phase of the melt season and rely on temperature as the primary factor influencing snowmelt."}, {"question": "How do energy-balance and temperature-index models compare in terms of performance in simulating snowpack density and water equivalent?", "answer": "Both models perform very well in simulating density and water equivalent for the 1972–1973 snow season, with the energy-balance model giving somewhat better results in three of the other melt seasons examined, while the temperature-index model was slightly better during one season. However, the energy-balance model is considered more accurate, especially in open or variably meteorological conditions."}, {"question": "Why is the energy-balance model considered more suitable for relatively open or variably meteorological watersheds?", "answer": "The energy-balance model is considered more suitable because it accounts for various meteorological factors such as solar radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed, which can significantly impact snowmelt in open or variably meteorological conditions.

Without these data, the model's ability to simulate real-world conditions would be significantly compromised."}, {"question": "In the context of snowpack modeling, what challenges or limitations have been observed in model performance across different sites and years?", "answer": "There is a great deal of variability in model performance from year to year and site to site, indicating that no single model is universally \"best\" for all locations or conditions. This variability suggests that models need to be carefully selected and calibrated for specific sites and conditions, and that continuous evaluation and improvement of these models are necessary to enhance their predictive capabilities."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the areal depletion of snow cover in forested catchments when modeling snowmelt runoff?", "answer": "Considering the areal depletion of snow cover is important because it affects the overall snowmelt runoff. Models that account for this depletion, such as those proposed by Buttle and McDonnell, can provide more accurate predictions of snowmelt runoff by capturing the spatial variability of snow cover and its impact on runoff generation. This is particularly relevant in forested catchments where snow cover can vary significantly due to factors like canopy cover and topography."}, {"question": "How do the findings of Rutter et al.

This variability underscores the need for continued research and development of snowmelt models that can accurately capture the diverse conditions found in different hydrological and meteorological settings.

{"paragraph": "5.7.4 Summary Snowmelt  is  a  significant  contributor  to  runoff and water supplies over much of the Northern Hemi- sphere, and changes in snowmelt runoff will be one of the most pronounced hydrologic responses to global warming.  Thus  it  is  important  that  the  processes  of snow accumulation and melt are accurately captured in  land-surface  models.  Many  agencies  have  devel- oped models that are specifically designed for particu- lar  regions,  data  sources,  and  purposes.  However, they all attempt to simulate melt processes on the ba- sis of meteorological data to account for the typically Figure 5.36 Daily snow- melt measured by lysimeter and simulated by the temper- ature-index approach, the hybrid approach, and the energy-balance approach at Weissfluhjoch, Switzerland, for the 1985 melt season [Kustas et al.

Be- cause of the wide variability of conditions, the sparse- ness of surface meteorological data, and the need to provide  operational  forecasts  at  relatively  short  time intervals (usually less than 24 hr), some of these mod- els use semi-empirical relations rather than physically based  models  of  melt  and  water  movement.  Many watershed-scale  models  use  some  form  of  tempera- ture-index model or hybrid approach to predict melt. These results lead to the following conclusions: • The  understanding  of  snowpack  processes  as  de- veloped in sections 5.5 and 5.6 can be used to sim- ulate point snowmelt to a high degree of precision given careful measurements of the meteorological inputs at the point of interest. • The temperature-index approach can provide use- ful  estimates  of  daily  snowmelt,  but  the  value  of the melt coefficient should reflect local conditions and seasonal changes. • The hybrid approach appears to predict daily snow- melt  with  a  precision  equivalent  to  the  complete energy balance and, since good estimates of the ra- diation components of the energy balance can usu- ally  be  made  with  commonly  available  data,  this approach will often be attractive for modeling. However, recent reviews of approaches to mod- eling snow processes (Roesch 2006; Andreadis et al. 2009;  Parajka  et  al.  2010b;  Rutter  et  al.  2009)  have noted  that  the  representation  of  snow  processes  in land-surface models is a key area in which improve- ments  are  required.  Part  of  the  difficulty  arises  be- cause the physics of snow accumulation and ablation operate  at  much  finer  temporal  and  spatial  scales than those resolved in most models. This problem is particularly important in mountainous areas, where orographic  effects  influence  local  precipitation,  and in forested areas, where the canopy affects all aspects of the energy balance in complex ways. Important  challenges  in  modeling  snowmelt over large areas remain, including: • Accounting  for  differences  in  snow  accumulation and  melt  over  the  typically  large  range  of  varia- tions in topography, elevation, and vegetation.

The term thus includes evap- oration from rivers and lakes (open water), bare soil, and vegetative surfaces (interception loss); evapora- tion from within the leaves of plants (transpiration); and sublimation from ice and snow surfaces. Globally,  about  62%  of  the  precipitation  that falls on the continents is evapotranspired, amounting to  73,000  (table  2.6).  Of  this,  about  42% (29,000 km3/yr) is transpiration (various models esti- mate a range from 25 to 64%; Wang and Dickinson 2012)  and  about  3%  (2,000  is  open-water evaporation.  Most  of  the  remainder  is  interception loss; soil evaporation is a minor component of the to- tal.  Figure  2.27  shows  the  global  distribution  of evapotranspiration, and tables 2.7 and 2.8 give data on evapotranspiration from the continents and from major river basins. Note that evapotranspiration ex- ceeds runoff in most of the river basins and on all the continents except Antarctica. A quantitative understanding of evapotranspira- tion is of vital practical importance: • Evapotranspiration is a major component of energy as well as water-vapor exchange between land sur- faces  and  atmosphere  (figure  2.3).  Understanding Evapotranspiration relations  between  evapotranspiration  and  ecosys- tem type is a requirement for predicting ecosystem response to climate change (Woodward 1987). • Evapotranspiration  is  essential  to  the  growth  of plants  that  form  the  base  of  natural  ecosystems and agriculture. • Over the long  term, the difference  between conti- nental  precipitation  and  evapotranspiration  is  the water available for direct human use and manage- ment.  Thus  quantitative  assessments  of  water  re- sources  and  the  effects  of  climate  and  land-use change  on  those  resources  require  a  quantitative understanding of evapotranspiration. • Much of the world’s food supply is grown on irri- gated land, and irrigation is one of the largest uses of  water  in  the  United  States  and  many  other countries.  Efficient  irrigation  requires  knowledge of crop water use (transpiration), so that water will be applied only as needed. • Evaporation  has  a  significant  influence  on  the yield  of  water-supply  reservoirs,  and  thus  on  the economics of building reservoirs of various sizes. • The fraction of water falling in a given rain storm that  contributes  to  streamflow  and  to  ground-wa- ter  recharge  is  in  large  part  determined  by  the “wetness” of the land; this wetness depends on the Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange amount  of  evapotranspiration  that  has  occurred since the previous storm. Direct  measurement  of  evapotranspiration  is much more difficult and expensive than of precipita- tion and streamflow, and is usually impractical. Thus hydrologists  have  developed  an  array  of  methods that  provide  estimates  of  evapotranspiration  based on measurements of more readily measured quanti- ties.  A  major  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to  show  how these methods are based on the basic physics of radi- ant-energy exchange (section 2.1.3), the laws of gases (sections  3.1  and  3.2),  and  the  physics  of  turbulent mass  and  energy  exchange  (turbulent  diffusion)  at the earth’s surface (sections 3.3 and 3.5). These rela- tions  are  involved  in  liquid-vapor  and  solid-vapor phase  changes  at  all  surfaces,  including  transpiring leaves, and the chapter begins by reviewing and ex- tending  those  basic  relations.

Conversely, when the water surface is colder than the air, atmospheric stability can suppress evaporation, highlighting the complex interplay between water temperature, air temperature, and evaporation processes."}, {"question": "In the absence of buoyancy effects, what is the relationship between the mass-transfer coefficient and the eddy diffusivity?", "answer": "In the absence of buoyancy effects, the mass-transfer coefficient (K) equals the eddy diffusivity, indicating that the transfer of water vapor from the surface to the atmosphere is solely governed by turbulent diffusion processes."}, {"question": "How does the temperature difference between the water surface and the air influence the value of b in equation (6.25)?", "answer": "The temperature difference between the water surface and the air influences the value of b by making it a positive quantity that increases with the temperature difference when the surface is warmer than the air. This relationship is critical for accurately modeling evaporation under conditions where free convection plays a significant role."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the term b in equation (6.12), and how does it relate to evaporation in the absence of wind?", "answer": "The term b in equation (6.12) is significant because it accounts for free-convection effects, allowing for the estimation of evaporation rates even in the absence of wind. When the water surface is warmer than the air, b > 0, indicating that there is turbulent transport of water vapor away from the surface due to free convection, even without wind."}, {"question": "In the context of large lakes, how does thermal inertia affect the seasonal variation of b?", "answer": "Thermal inertia in large lakes leads to considerable seasonal variation in b, with b < 0 in summer when the lake is colder than the air, and b > 0 in fall and winter when the lake is warmer. This variation is due to the lake's thermal inertia, which causes it to warm up or cool down more slowly than the surrounding air, affecting the direction and magnitude of heat and vapor transfer."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to model evaporation accurately, especially in situations with significant temperature differences between the water surface and the air?", "answer": "Modeling evaporation accurately is challenging because it involves complex interactions between the water surface, the atmosphere, and the surrounding environment, particularly when there are significant temperature differences. These differences can lead to free convection, which enhances evaporation, but also introduces variability and non-linearity into the evaporation process, making it harder to predict accurately without considering these dynamics."}, {"question": "How does the equation proposed by Rasmussen et al. (1995) account for the effect of atmospheric instability on evaporation?", "answer": "The equation proposed by Rasmussen et al. (1995) accounts for the effect of atmospheric instability by modeling b as a positive quantity that increases with the temperature difference between the surface and the air, thus incorporating the impact of free convection on evaporation rates. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how atmospheric conditions influence evaporation, particularly in scenarios where the water surface is warmer than the air."}, {"question": "In what scenarios is free convection most common, and what are its implications for evaporation rates?", "answer": "Free convection is most common in scenarios where the water body has been artificially heated, such as in cooling ponds or river reaches receiving heated water from power plants. It also occurs naturally in large lakes due to thermal inertia. The implications of free convection for evaporation rates are significant, as it can lead to increased evaporation even in the absence of wind, highlighting the need to consider these effects in evaporation models to ensure accuracy."}, {"question": "How does the mass-transfer approach to evaporation account for the role of wind speed in the evaporation process?", "answer": "The mass-transfer approach accounts for the role of wind speed through the measurement of wind speed at a specific height, which is used in conjunction with air vapor pressure to estimate evaporation rates."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.3.2.2 Practical Considerations Use  of  equation  (6.26)  or  (6.27)  requires  mea- surement  of  wind  speed,  air  temperature,  and  hu- midity at a height above the surface, and of surface temperature.  Clearly  all  measured  values  should  be representative  of  the  entire  water  body,  which  may be difficult to accomplish using shore-based observa- tion stations (Sene et al. 1991). In fact, in a compara- tive study, Winter et al. (1995, p. 991) concluded that “the  mass  transfer  equation  is  acceptable  only  if  a raft  station  is  used  so  that  water  temperature  and wind  speed  data can be  obtained  near the center of the lake.” If the lake surface is highly irregular with many  inlets,  it  may  be  difficult  to  obtain  measure- ments  representative  of  the  entire  water  body,  al- though  surface  temperature  may  be  obtained  from satellite  observations  of  outgoing  thermal  radiation (Croley 1989). Many  studies  have  been  done  to  verify  the  ap- propriate values for b  and b  and, because of varia- tions  in  lake  size,  measurement  height,  instrument location, atmospheric stability, and time  scale, each study has obtained a different set of values. The Lake Hefner project (Harbeck et al. 1954) and a study by Ficke  (1972)  in  Indiana  were  among  the  most  de- tailed  and  careful  of  these  studies  because  accurate estimates  of  daily  evaporation  could  be  indepen- dently obtained via the water balance. In both cases, e(z ) represents the vapor pressure of the air unmodi- fied by passage over the lake. Both studies confirmed that    =  0,  and  Harbeck  et  al.  (1954)  found    al- most  identical  to  the  value  in equation (6.26) while Ficke  (1972)  found    about  15%  smaller.  A  later study of Lake Erie found K  very close to Harbeck’s Lake Hefner value (Derecki 1976). It  appears  that  much  of  the  variability  in found  in  various  studies  is  a  function  of  lake  area. Harbeck (1962) found that the empirical relation Chapter 6 Evapotranspiration = 1.26 · A can be used in equation (6.26) when lake area A  is and E  is in mm/day. There are two reasons for this area  effect:  (1)  since  water  surfaces  are  smoother than land surfaces, the efficiency of turbulent eddies in the vertical transport of water vapor decreases as the wind travels longer distances over a lake and (2) the vapor pressure will increase with downwind dis- tance as evaporation occurs, decreasing the effective vapor-pressure  difference  over  the  lake  compared with  the  value  measured  anywhere  except  on  the downwind shore. Thus  the  mass-transfer  approach  is  potentially useful for determining the amount of free-water evap- oration that has occurred during a given time period measured  at  a representative  location. However, the mass-transfer equation is derived for the instantaneous rate  of  evaporation  under  given  instantaneous  values of wind speed and vapor pressure. Because the vapor pressures  are  determined  from  measured  tempera- tures via the nonlinear relation of equation (6.2), and because  wind  speed  and  vapor-pressure  differences may  be  correlated,  one  cannot  assume  that  the  ap- proach will give the correct time-averaged rate of evap- oration  when  time-averaged  temperatures  and  wind speeds are used as independent variables. Using Lake Hefner  data,  Jobson  (1972)  determined  the  errors that  are  introduced  in  calculating  average  evapora- tion from averaged temperatures and wind speeds for averaging periods of 3 hr, 1 day, and 1 month. The re- sults,  shown  in  table  6.2,  indicate  that  little  error  is introduced for averaging periods up to 1 day, but that a bias is introduced with monthly averaging.

Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange In general, the mass-transfer method can be used to predict, forecast, or model free-water evaporation based  on  predicted,  forecast,  or  modeled  values  of the independent variables. It is particularly useful for modeling artificially heated water bodies, for which surface  temperatures  can  usually  be  readily  calcu- lated. However, it is difficult to apply the method for predicting  evaporation  in  naturally  heated  water bodies,  because  there  are  virtually  no  climatic  data on  water-surface  temperatures,  and  modeling  such temperatures is difficult. In a comparative study on a small lake Rosenberry et al.

This issue can be partially addressed by using raft stations or satellite observations for surface temperature. However, the variability in lake size, measurement height, instrument location, atmospheric stability, and time scale also contributes to the challenge of obtaining consistent and reliable measurements."}, {"question": "How do the empirical relations found in studies like Harbeck's Lake Hefner project and Ficke's study in Indiana contribute to understanding evaporation?", "answer": "These studies provided detailed and careful measurements that allowed for the verification of appropriate values for coefficients in the mass-transfer equation. They confirmed that certain coefficients are close to zero and found values for other coefficients that are almost identical to those in the equation. These findings contribute to a better understanding of evaporation by providing empirical evidence for the mass-transfer approach and highlighting the importance of considering factors like lake area and the efficiency of turbulent eddies in water vapor transport."}, {"question": "In the context of the mass-transfer approach, why does the lake area affect the evaporation rate, and what are the implications of this effect?", "answer": "The lake area affects the evaporation rate because the efficiency of turbulent eddies in transporting water vapor decreases as the wind travels longer distances over a lake, and the vapor pressure increases with downwind distance, decreasing the effective vapor-pressure difference. This area effect implies that the mass-transfer equation may need to be adjusted for different lake sizes, and it highlights the complexity of modeling evaporation in natural water bodies. The area effect also suggests that the mass-transfer approach may be more suitable for smaller lakes or for modeling artificially heated water bodies where surface temperatures can be readily calculated."}, {"question": "How does the nonlinearity of the relation between vapor pressure and temperature affect the calculation of time-averaged evaporation rates?", "answer": "The nonlinearity of this relation, combined with the potential correlation between wind speed and vapor-pressure differences, means that using time-averaged temperatures and wind speeds as independent variables can introduce errors in calculating average evaporation rates. This is because the mass-transfer equation is derived for instantaneous rates of evaporation, and averaging temperatures and wind speeds over time can lead to biases, especially for longer averaging periods like a month."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of applying the mass-transfer method for predicting evaporation in naturally heated water bodies?", "answer": "The main limitation is the lack of climatic data on water-surface temperatures and the difficulty of modeling such temperatures. This makes it challenging to apply the mass-transfer method, which relies on accurate surface temperature data, to predict evaporation in naturally heated water bodies. In contrast, the method is more useful for modeling artificially heated water bodies where surface temperatures can be calculated."}, {"question": "In the context of comparative studies on evaporation methods, why do mass-transfer methods often show large deviations from evaporation rates calculated by other methods?", "answer": "The paragraph does not explicitly state why mass-transfer methods show large deviations but implies that the complexity of natural systems, variability in factors like lake size and atmospheric conditions, and the challenges in obtaining representative measurements contribute to these deviations. The mention of a comparative study on a small lake by Rosenberry et al. (2007) suggests that the performance of mass-transfer methods can vary significantly depending on the specific conditions of the water body being studied."}, {"question": "How does the use of raft stations or satellite observations address the challenge of obtaining representative surface temperature measurements?", "answer": "The use of raft stations allows for the collection of water temperature and wind speed data near the center of the lake, providing more representative measurements of the entire water body. Satellite observations of outgoing thermal radiation can also be used to obtain surface temperature data, especially in cases where in-situ measurements are challenging due to the lake's irregular surface or other factors. These methods help to improve the accuracy of evaporation calculations by reducing the uncertainty associated with surface temperature measurements."}, {"question": "Why is the mass-transfer approach potentially useful for determining the amount of free-water evaporation?", "answer": "The mass-transfer approach is potentially useful because it can provide a direct estimate of evaporation based on measurable parameters like wind speed, vapor pressure, and surface temperature. This makes it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting evaporation, especially in situations where other methods may be less applicable or accurate. However, its usefulness is contingent upon obtaining high-quality, representative measurements of the required parameters."}]}

This simplification can enhance the practicality and accuracy of evaporation rate calculations.

Surface-water inflows and outflows can bring in or remove heat directly, while ground-water inflows and outflows can influence the lake's temperature more subtly but still contribute to the overall energy balance. Neglecting either component could lead to inaccurate calculations of the lake's energy storage changes and evaporation rates."}, {"question": "How does the specific heat of water influence the calculation of the change in energy storage in a lake?", "answer": "The specific heat of water (c) is a critical parameter in calculating the change in energy storage in a lake, as it determines how much energy is required to change the temperature of a given mass of water. A higher specific heat capacity means that more energy is needed to change the temperature, and thus, it directly affects the calculation of ΔU. The formula ΔU = c · ρ · (V2 · T2 - V1 · T1) shows that the specific heat of water, along with the density of water and the changes in volume and temperature, is essential for accurately determining the energy storage changes in the lake."}, {"question": "What challenges arise when applying the Bowen ratio in situations with very small vapor-pressure differences?", "answer": "When the vapor-pressure difference becomes very small"}]}
{"paragraph": "6.3.3.2 Practical Considerations The  energy-balance  approach  requires  precise determination  of  all  the  nonnegligible  quantities  in the  basic  equation  because  all  measurement  errors are included in the final computation of evaporation. However,  it  is  often  possible  to  determine  values  of the surface energy-balance components with greater accuracy than possible for other approaches, and the energy-balance/Bowen-ratio  approach  is  often  used as the standard determination of free-water evapora- tion  against  which  other  methods  are  compared (Winter et al. 1995; Rosenberry et al. 2007). Ways of determining  values  of  the  radiation  components when  direct  measurements  are  lacking  were  intro- duced  in  section  5.5.2;  these  are  reviewed  and  ex- tended in box 6.1. In most situations, the heat exchange by conduc- tion  between  a  lake  and  the  underlying  sediments (G)  is  not  measured  and  is  assumed  negligible. Rosenberry  et  al.  (1993)  found  that  this  term  ac- counted for about 7% of evaporation. For  determining  lake  evaporation,  the  magni- tude of the advection and heat-storage terms must be assessed. These depend on the climate, geologic and hydrologic  setting,  and  the  area,  volume,  and  resi- dence  time  of  water  in  the  lake  relative  to  the  time period of the analysis. Clearly, a detailed evaluation of  the  advection  term  is  a  formidable  measurement challenge.  However,  Kohler  and  Parmele  (1967) stated that the effects of advected energy are small— unless  inflows  and  outflows  are  large  relative  to evaporation,  and  even  then  only  if  inflow  and  out- flow temperatures differ appreciably. In many cases, errors may be minimized by choosing Δt so that the term in parentheses in equation (6.34) is likely to be Box 6.1 Determination of Shortwave and Longwave Radiation Fluxes for Energy-Balance Computations Shortwave (Solar) Net shortwave, or solar, radiation, K, is given by where K  is incident solar radiation and a is the albedo (shortwave reflectivity) of the water surface. Incident and reflected solar radiation can be measured with pyranometers, but this is routinely done at only scat- tered locations. Where K  is not directly measured, it is best determined from hourly, daily, and monthly insola- tion values representative of large areas (~0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude) developed from Geostationary Opera- tional Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery (Justus et al. 1986). When observations of the fraction of sky cov- ered by cloud, C, are available, K  can be determined from empirical relations such as (Croley 1989), where K  is the incident clear-sky solar radiation determined from the latitude, time of year, and humidity using the relations given in appendix D. How- ever, manual observations of C are no longer routinely available in the United States. Koberg (1964) presented an empirical relation giving the albedo of a water surface as a function of K : is in MJ/m2 · day; other studies have assumed a constant albedo value in the range 0.05 ≤ a ≤ 0.10. Longwave The net input of longwave energy, L, is the difference between the incident flux, L , emitted by the atmo- sphere and clouds and the outgoing radiation from the surface, L : L ≡ L  – L . (6B1.4) L  and L  can be measured directly by means of pyrgeometers or as the difference between all-wave radiation measured by a radiometer and shortwave Chapter 6 Evapotranspiration small. In most situations this will be true if Δt = 1 yr unless  the  residence  time  of  water  in  the  lake  is greater than 1 yr. The  may  be  quite  well  constrained  by measuring  water-temperature  profiles  and  lake  vol- ume  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  measurement period. In regions that experience cold winters, lakes become isothermal at the temperature of maximum density (3.98°C) in the fall and spring, so those times radiation measured by a pyranometer. However, such measurements are available at only a few locations, so the longwave component of the energy balance is usu- ally estimated using the Stefan–Boltzmann equation [equation (2.1)] and readily available meteorological observations as described below. Incident longwave energy flux is given by L  = ε (6B1.5) where ε  is the integrated effective emissivity of the atmosphere, σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (σ = is the air temperature (K). The outgoing longwave flux is the sum of the radia- tion emitted by the lake surface and the portion of the incident radiation reflected by the surface. Since the longwave reflectivity of a surface equals one minus its longwave emissivity, 4 + (1 – ε out s s s in where the subscript s designates surface values. Com- fying gives 4 – ε 4, s  at  a s s where ε  = 0.95 for water. As discussed in section 5.5.2.2, ε  is largely a function of humidity and cloud cover. Flerchinger et al. (2009) reviewed empirical formulas for estimating ε  and found the best results using where surface vapor pressure e  > 0.285 kPa and C is fractional cloud cover. However, Abramowitz et al. (2012) found that is in MJ/m2 · day and e (where L  is in kPa) performed best for both clear and cloudy conditions, and sug- gested its use without correcting for clouds. Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange can be used to bound Δt. It may be possible to relate average  lake  temperature  to  water-surface  tempera- ture (Rosenberry et al. 1993), which can be remotely sensed; however, the relation between the two must be  established  for  each  lake,  and  at  least  for  deep lakes  will  vary  seasonally.  This  is  shown  in  figure 6.1:  Heat  storage  reaches  a  maximum  in  the  fall  in Lake  Superior,  shifting  the  annual  peak  of  evapora- tion such that it is out of phase with the annual cy- cles  of  air  temperature,  water  temperature,  and humidity (Croley 1992). Kohler and Parmele (1967) found  that  heat-storage  effects  can  be  neglected  in computing  long-term  average  evaporation  for  all lakes,  and  annual  evaporation  for  lakes  with  resi- dence times less than 1 yr. Even  if  there  are  significant  advection  and/or heat-storage  effects  on  the  water  temperature  in  a given lake, only a portion of that energy affects evap- oration;  the  rest  affects  sensible-heat  exchange  and longwave  radiation  emission.  Kohler  and  Parmele (1967) developed a general approach for assessing the fraction of the advection and heat-storage effects that is reflected in lake evaporation; this is summarized in box 6.2 and figure 6.2, both on p. 264. It suggests that in  many  cases,  less  than  half  the  energy  inputs  or losses  due  to  advection  and  storage  are  reflected  in the evaporation rate, reducing the difference between lake evaporation and free-water evaporation. L. J. Anderson, who conducted the elaborate en- ergy-balance  studies  at  Lake  Hefner,  concluded  that “the energy-budget equation, when applied to periods greater  than  7  days,  will result  in  a  maximum  accu- racy approaching ± 5 per cent of the mean . . . evapo- ration, providing all terms in the energy budget have been evaluated with the utmost accuracy, particularly changes  in  energy  storage”  (Harbeck  et  al.  1954,  p. 117). He found that considerable error in evaluating the change in energy storage may occur if the method is applied  to  periods of less than seven days. Rosen- berry  et  al.  (1993)  found  that  the  energy-budget  ap- proach gave the best estimates of lake evaporation for a small lake in Minnesota and investigated the effects of  using  various  instrumentation  and  approaches  to determining energy-budget components. As with the mass-transfer method, it is difficult to  apply  the  energy-budget  approach  in  the  predic- tion,  forecasting,  or  modeling  mode  because  of  the requirement  for  water-surface  temperatures.  How- ever,  Hostetler  and  Bartlein  (1990)  developed  a model that simulates the vertical distribution of lake temperatures  through  time  coupled  to  energy-bal- ance computations, and this appears promising as an Figure 6.1 (a) Variation of total heat storage with sur- face temperature in Lake Superior in 1976.

{"paragraph": "6.3.5.2 Practical Considerations Pans on land are placed in clearings suitable for rain gauges (see chapter 4), surrounded by a fence to prevent  animals  from  drinking,  and  may  be  sunken so  that  the  water  surface  is  approximately  in  the same  plane  as  the  ground  surface  or  raised  a  stan- dard height above the ground. For special studies of lake  evaporation,  pans  are  sometimes  placed  in  the center  of  a  floating  platform  with  dimensions  large enough  to  insure  stability  and  prevent  water  from splashing in, again with the surface either at or above the lake surface. Several different standard types of pans are used by different countries and agencies. Shaw (1988) de- scribed  the  types  used  in  Great  Britain,  the  former Soviet Union, and the United States, and figure 6.4 shows the standard “Class-A” pan used by the NWS and in Canada. An evaporation pan differs from a lake in having far  less  heat-storage  capacity,  in  lacking  surface-  or ground-water  inputs  or outputs, and, in raised pans like  the  Class  A,  in  having  sides  exposed  to  the  air and sun. These differences significantly affect the en- ergy  balance,  elevating  the  warm-season  average Part II: Surface-Atmosphere Water and Energy Exchange temperature and vapor pressure of the water surface of a pan relative to that of a nearby lake. The ratio of lake evaporation to pan evaporation is called the pan coefficient; its annual average over the United States is  about  0.7.  Within  the  evaporation  season,  heat- storage  effects  cause  water  temperatures  in  lakes  to be generally lower than those of  pans in the  spring, and  higher  in  the  fall.  Thus  pan  coefficients  follow the  same  pattern,  with  values  lower  than  the  sea- sonal  average  in  the  spring  and  higher  in  the  fall (e.g., figure 6.5). The Class-A pan is usually installed with an ane- mometer  and  a  floating  maximum-minimum  ther- mometer,  providing  data  on  average  daily  wind speed and average water-surface temperature. Kohler et al. (1955) developed an empirical equation to use these data along with air temperature to account for the energy exchange through the sides of a pan and thereby  adjust  daily  pan  evaporation  to  daily  free- water evaporation: ± 0.064 · p · α pan pan pan where E is in mm/day, E  is daily pan evaporation average  wind  speed  at  a  height  of  15  cm  above  the pan  (km/day),    is  water-surface  temperature  in following E  is + when T  > T  and – when T pan span a span . The factor α < T  is the proportion of energy ex- changed through the sides of the pan that is used for, or lost from, evaporation, which is estimated as = 0.34 + 0.0117 · T pan span + 17.8)3 + 0.0135 · u 0.36 span pan using the same units as in equation (6.41) (Linsley et al.  1982).  Because  inputs  and  outputs  of  energy through the sides of a pan  tend to balance out over the course of a year, adjustments via equations (6.41) and (6.42) may not be needed for annual values. Pan  evaporation  data  provide  a  useful  basis  for understanding  the  regional  climatology  of  seasonal or annual free-water evaporation and long-term aver- age  lake  evaporation.  Pan  coefficients  and  annual free-water  evaporation  have  been  summarized  and mapped  by  Farnsworth  and  Thompson  (1982)  (fig- ure 6.6). Since  year-to-year  variations  of pan  evaporation are usually not large, observations for a few years can provide  a  satisfactory  estimate  of  annual  values, which  can  then  be  adjusted  by  the  appropriate  re- gional pan coefficient to give an estimate of free-wa- ter  evaporation.

However, it is crucial to adjust these estimates by the appropriate regional pan coefficient to obtain accurate estimates of free-water evaporation."}, {"question": "In the context of planning for a water-supply reservoir, why is it essential to consider the differences between pan evaporation and actual lake evaporation?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the differences between pan evaporation and actual lake evaporation when planning for a water-supply reservoir because advection and storage can cause actual lake evaporation to be considerably different from pan-estimated free-water evaporation. For example, the Lake Hefner study found that applying an annual coefficient to pan evaporation can estimate annual lake evaporation within 10 to 15% on average, provided lake depth and climatic regime are taken into account in selecting the coefficient. This highlights the need for careful consideration of these factors to ensure accurate estimates of lake evaporation and effective planning for water-supply reservoirs."}, {"question": "Why is the combination method, which accounts for heat exchange through the pan, suitable for estimating free-water-surface evaporation on an annual basis and for shorter periods?", "answer": "The combination method is suitable for estimating free-water-surface evaporation on an annual basis and for shorter periods because it accounts for heat exchange through the pan via equations (6.41) and (6.42). This method closely approximates pan evaporation, as indicated by Van Bavel's (1966) results and other studies. By accounting for the energy exchange through the sides of the pan, the combination method provides a more accurate estimate of free-water-surface evaporation, making it a reliable approach for hydrological applications."}]}

{"paragraph": "6.3.6.2 Practical Considerations While  the  water-balance  approach  is  simple  in concept,  it  is  generally  far  from  simple  in  applica- tion,  because  the  measurement  of  all  water  inputs and outputs for a water body is generally a formida- ble task: • All major streams entering the body and the outlet stream  must  be  continuously  gauged,  and  some method must be devised for estimating the amount of any nonchannelized surface-water flow inputs. • The discussion in section 9.3.2 makes it clear that it  is  difficult  to  assess  ground-water  inflows  and outflows  to  lakes.  At  best,  these  are  usually  esti- mated  from  gradients  observed  in  a  few  observa- tion  wells  and  assumptions  about  the  saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity of surround- ing geologic formations, perhaps supplemented by scattered observations with seepage meters. • If the lake is large and the surrounding topography irregular, it may be difficult to obtain precise mea- surements of precipitation (section 4.3). • Changes in storage can be estimated from careful observations of water levels if one has good infor- mation on the lake’s bathymetry, and if corrections are made for changes in water density. Winter  (1981)  made  a  thorough  analysis  of  the uncertainties in estimating lake water balances; even for the “readily” measurable components the results are  somewhat  discouraging  (table  6.3).

For example, LaBaugh (1985) found that evaporation was a small fraction of the total outflow and less than the uncertainty in the overall balance of a reservoir in Colorado (figure 6.7). If reasonably accurate information on the significant balance components is available, the method can pro- vide  a  rough—and  in  rare  cases  a  quite  accurate— check on evaporation estimated by other approaches. Table  6.3  indicates  that  the  accuracy  of  the  method generally increases as Δt increases. Because  of  the  difficulty  in  finding  situations where  all  the  significant  terms  on  the  right  side  of equation  (6.43)  can  be  measured  with  sufficient  ac- curacy,  the  water-budget  approach  has  only  rarely been used to determine lake evaporation. One of the more successful applications of the approach was in an extensive comparison of methods for determining lake  evaporation  conducted  by  the  USGS  in  the early  1950s  at  Lake  Hefner,  Oklahoma  (Harbeck  et al.  1954).

{"paragraph": "6.4 Bare-Soil Evaporation More  than  one-third  of  the  earth’s  land  surface consists of soil orders that support little or no vegeta- tion: Entisols, Inceptisols, and Aridisols (table 2.14; figure  2.47).  In  addition,  most  agricultural  lands have meager vegetative cover much of the time. Thus evaporation from bare soil is globally significant and vitally  important  to  farmers,  especially  in  the  man- agement of irrigation. Following  infiltration  due  to  significant  rain, snowmelt, or irrigation, evaporation from a wet bare soil (also called exfiltration) above a water table gen- erally occurs in two distinct stages (figure 6.8). In  this  stage, Stage  1:  Atmosphere-Controlled. the  evaporation  rate  (E )  is  largely  determined  by the  surface  energy balance  and mass-transfer  con- ditions (wind and humidity) and occurs at or near the rate of free-water evaporation.

Soil evaporation during stage 1  can  be estimated  by  the approaches  appropriate for  free-water  evaporation  (section  6.3),  of  which the  Penman  equation  [equation  (6.36)]  usually gives the best results (Parlange and Katul 1992a). Substituting this value into equation (6.41) yields = 9.76 mm/day. Table 6B4.3 compares the daily evaporation values calculated by the various approaches. Obviously, the comparison for one day on one lake does not indicate which approach is most accurate; all calculated values are substantially higher than the value given by the water balance.

This relationship is crucial because it influences how water moves through the soil, with larger pores allowing for more rapid water movement and thus affecting the timing and rate of evaporation. Understanding this relationship is essential for accurately modeling and predicting evaporation from bare soils, especially in agricultural lands where soil type can significantly impact irrigation management."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating evaporation from bare soil, what is the significance of the Penman equation?", "answer": "The Penman equation is significant because it usually gives the best results for estimating evaporation during Stage 1, which can then be used to simplify the estimation of Stage 2 evaporation by invoking a relationship between Stage 1 evaporation, soil properties, and the duration of Stage 1. This approach simplifies the complex process of estimating evaporation from bare soils, making it more practical for applications such as irrigation management."}, {"question": "How does the formation of the secondary drying front during the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 evaporation affect water movement in the soil?", "answer": "The formation of the secondary drying front marks a shift in water movement from capillary action and vaporization at the surface to vapor diffusion through the dry layer and film-flow in the water held on soil particles by surface tension. This change significantly reduces the evaporation rate, as water movement becomes more restricted. The secondary drying front essentially acts as a barrier, limiting the direct connection between the water table and the soil surface, thus controlling the rate at which water can evaporate."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 evaporation important for agricultural practices?", "answer": "Understanding the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 evaporation is crucial for agricultural practices, particularly in the management of irrigation. Accurate estimation of evaporation rates during both stages can help farmers optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water waste and ensuring that crops receive the right amount of moisture. This is especially important in areas with limited water resources, where efficient irrigation management can significantly impact crop yields and sustainability. Furthermore, recognizing the visual signs of the transition, such as changes in soil surface brightness, can provide practical, non-invasive methods for monitoring soil moisture status and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly."}, {"question": "In what ways can the simplified approach to estimating Stage 2 evaporation, based on Stage 1 evaporation rate and duration, be beneficial for hydrological studies?", "answer": "The simplified approach to estimating Stage 2 evaporation can be beneficial for hydrological studies by providing a more straightforward method for predicting evaporation rates from bare soils. This approach can reduce the complexity and uncertainty associated with estimating evaporation, especially in data-scarce regions. By leveraging the relationship between Stage 1 and Stage 2 evaporation, researchers can more easily integrate evaporation estimates into larger hydrological models, enhancing our understanding of water balance and cycling at various scales. Additionally, this approach can facilitate the use of remote sensing data, such as changes in soil albedo, to monitor and predict evaporation patterns over large areas, offering valuable insights for water resource management and agricultural planning."}, {"question": "How does the physical characteristic of the soil influence the evaporation rate during Stage 2?", "answer": "During Stage 2, the evaporation rate is controlled largely by the soil's physical characteristics, such as pore size and the ability of the soil to hold water by surface tension. These characteristics influence the rate of vapor diffusion and film-flow, which are the primary mechanisms of water movement during this stage. Soils with smaller pores and higher water-holding capacities tend to have lower evaporation rates during Stage 2, as water movement is more restricted. Understanding these relationships is essential for predicting evaporation rates accurately and for managing irrigation and water resources effectively, especially in soils with diverse physical properties."}]}

It involves the absorption of soil water by plant roots, transportation through the vascular system to the leaves, and evaporation from the walls of stomatal cavities into the ambient air through stomata. This process is essential for plants to absorb carbon dioxide for carbohydrate production and also performs functions such as maintaining turgor pressure and delivering mineral nutrients."}, {"question": "How do plants control the rate of transpiration, and what factors influence this control?", "answer": "Plants control the rate of transpiration by adjusting the size of stomatal openings, which affects the ease of vapor movement to the air. The major factors influencing this control include light, humidity, and the water content of leaf cells. For example, most plants open stomata during the day and close them at night, and stomatal openings decrease as humidity increases or when daytime water contents become too low."}, {"question": "In the process of transpiration, why is the evaporation of water an unavoidable concomitant of carbon dioxide dissolution?", "answer": "The evaporation of water is an unavoidable concomitant of carbon dioxide dissolution because plants require water to dissolve carbon dioxide for carbohydrate production. The stomatal cavities provide a place where this dissolution can occur, and as water evaporates, it creates a vapor-pressure difference that allows carbon dioxide to enter the plant tissue. This process highlights the intricate relationship between water and carbon dioxide in plant metabolism."}, {"question": "What is the difference between transpiration and open-water evaporation, and how do plants exert control over transpiration?", "answer": "The major difference between transpiration and open-water evaporation is that plants can exert some control over the size of stomatal openings, thereby influencing the rate of vapor movement to the air. In contrast, open-water evaporation occurs without such control. Plants exert control through the action of guard cells, which adjust stomatal openings in response to factors like light, humidity, and leaf water content, allowing for a degree of regulation over water loss."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is it important to consider the factors affecting stomatal opening and closing?", "answer": "Considering the factors affecting stomatal opening and closing is crucial in hydrological modeling because these factors significantly influence the rate of transpiration, which in turn affects the water balance and energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. Understanding and accurately representing these processes in models is essential for predicting water availability, soil moisture, and plant growth, especially under varying environmental conditions."}, {"question": "How does the transpiration stream maintain its integrity, especially in tall trees, and what mechanisms do trees have to address potential disruptions?", "answer": "The transpiration stream maintains its integrity due to the great cohesive strength of water resulting from its intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This cohesion allows water to be pulled up through the vascular system to heights of the tallest trees. However, when bubbles form in the stream, trees have evolved mechanisms to heal them and maintain transpiration. This is critical for ensuring continuous water supply to the leaves for photosynthesis and other physiological processes."}, {"question": "In the context of soil-water interaction, how does the growth of roots towards water sources impact the transpiration process?", "answer": "The growth of roots towards water sources is a key aspect of the transpiration process, as it allows plants to access water from the soil. Roots typically grow several tens of millimeters per day during the growing season, coming into contact with soil water mostly by growing towards it. This growth induces a water-content gradient between the root and the soil, which in turn induces the movement of soil water into the root, following Darcy’s law. This process is essential for maintaining the transpiration stream and ensuring that plants have a continuous supply of water."}, {"question": "Why is the mathematical representation of transpiration important in hydrological modeling, and what factors should it consider?", "answer": "A mathematical representation of transpiration is important in hydrological modeling because it allows for the quantification of water loss from plants and its impact on the water balance. This representation should consider the factors most important in hydrological modeling, including the effects of light, humidity, and leaf water content on stomatal opening and closing, as well as the physical processes driving water movement through the plant and into the atmosphere. By accurately modeling these processes, hydrologists can better predict water availability and plant growth under various environmental conditions."}, {"question": "How does the process of transpiration impact the water content of the soil, and what are the implications for soil moisture and water availability?", "answer": "The process of transpiration impacts the water content of the soil by inducing a water-content gradient between the root and the soil, which leads to the movement of soil water into the root. As plants absorb water from the soil, the soil-water content decreases, affecting soil moisture and water availability"}]}

It is essential to understand whether interception loss is an addition to or a replacement for transpiration loss to evaluate these effects accurately. This distinction is crucial because it influences how changes in vegetation, such as those caused by human activities like deforestation, will alter the hydrologic cycle locally and globally."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the physical basis of the interception process important in hydrology?", "answer": "Understanding the physical basis of the interception process is vital because it allows for the prediction of how changes, such as those induced by human activities or climate change, will affect the hydrologic cycle. This knowledge is necessary to sort out the impacts of these changes on a local and global scale. A sound physical basis helps in evaluating the effects of altered precipitation climatology and vegetation changes on interception loss and, consequently, on regional water balances."}, {"question": "In what ways can vegetation alter the hydrologic cycle, and what are the implications of these alterations?", "answer": "Vegetation can alter the hydrologic cycle through processes like interception, where precipitation is caught by the canopy and subject to evaporation. This process, known as interception loss, is a significant fraction of total evapotranspiration in most regions. Additionally, under certain conditions, vegetation can \"comb\" water from clouds and fog, adding water input to a region, a phenomenon referred to as \"positive interception\" or \"occult precipitation.\" These alterations have significant implications for regional water balances, especially when considering human-induced changes in vegetation cover."}, {"question": "How does the type and density of vegetation influence interception loss, and what factors contribute to this influence?", "answer": "The type, density, and stage of development of vegetation strongly influence interception loss. These factors are well-characterized by the leaf-area index. The intensity, duration, frequency, and form of precipitation also play a crucial role in determining interception loss. Human activities, such as deforestation, can alter vegetation type, thereby affecting interception loss and the overall hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "What is the significance of distinguishing between interception loss as an addition to or a replacement for transpiration loss in hydrologic studies?", "answer": "Distinguishing between interception loss as an addition to or a replacement for transpiration loss is significant because it directly impacts the evaluation of how vegetation changes affect regional water balances. If interception loss replaces transpiration loss, the net effect on water balance might be minimal. However, if it adds to transpiration loss, the impact on water availability could be substantial. This distinction is crucial for accurately predicting the effects of land use changes or climate change on hydrologic cycles."}, {"question": "In the context of climate change, why is it essential to understand the effects of altered precipitation climatology on interception loss?", "answer": "Understanding the effects of altered precipitation climatology on interception loss is essential because changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change can significantly impact the amount of water available for evapotranspiration and runoff. This, in turn, affects regional water balances and the overall hydrologic cycle. By understanding how changes in precipitation intensity, duration, and frequency influence interception loss, scientists can better predict and prepare for the impacts of climate change on water resources."}, {"question": "How does the phenomenon of \"positive interception\" or \"occult precipitation\" contribute to the hydrologic cycle, and under what conditions does it occur?", "answer": "The phenomenon of \"positive interception\" or \"occult precipitation\" occurs when vegetation \"combs\" water from clouds and fog, adding water input to a region. This process contributes to the hydrologic cycle by increasing the amount of water available for evapotranspiration and potentially altering local water balances. It occurs under specific weather conditions and highlights the complex interactions between vegetation, atmosphere, and hydrology."}, {"question": "What role does leaf-area index play in characterizing the influence of vegetation on interception loss, and why is it important?", "answer": "Leaf-area index plays a crucial role in characterizing the influence of vegetation on interception loss because it provides a quantitative measure of vegetation density and type. This index is important because it allows for the estimation of interception loss based on the physical characteristics of the vegetation, enabling more accurate predictions of how changes in vegetation will affect the hydrologic cycle. By incorporating leaf-area index into hydrologic models, scientists can better account for the variability in vegetation cover and its impact on water balances."}, {"question": "In the context of evapotranspiration, how does interception loss compare to transpiration loss, and what are the implications of this comparison?", "answer": "Interception loss is a significant fraction of total evapotranspiration in most regions, comparable to transpiration loss.

{"paragraph": "6.6.1 Definitions Figure  6.17  illustrates  the  following  definitions used in describing and measuring interception. • rainfall,  R,  is  the  rainfall  measured  above the vegetative canopy or in the open. • Canopy interception loss, Ec, is water that evapo- rates from the canopy. • Throughfall, Rt, is rainfall that reaches the ground surface directly through spaces in the canopy and by dripping from the canopy. • Stemflow, Rs, is water that reaches the ground sur- face by running down trunks and stems. • loss,  El,  is  water  that  evapo- Litter  interception rates  from  the  ground  surface  (usually  including near-ground plants and leaf litter). • loss,  Ei,  is  the  sum  of  canopy Total  interception and litter interception losses. • Net rainfall, Rn, is the gross rainfall minus the to- tal interception loss.

The difference between the latent-heat flux and the net radiation must be provided by downward sensible-heat transfer, and this energy is supplied by air advected from the surrounding region. Several studies (e.g., Stewart 1977) have shown that such energy advection is commonly involved in evaporating inter- cepted water, that is, interception loss can markedly cool the air regionally.

It is a component of the total interception loss (Ei), which also includes litter interception loss (El). The total interception loss is subtracted from the gross rainfall (R) to obtain the net rainfall (Rn), highlighting its significance in the water balance."}, {"question": "How does the latent-heat flux associated with evaporating intercepted water compare to the energy available from net radiation, and what implications does this have?", "answer": "The latent-heat flux associated with evaporating intercepted water is significantly higher than the energy available from net radiation, with the given example showing it to be over 15 times greater. This difference must be compensated by downward sensible-heat transfer, which is supplied by air advected from the surrounding region.

Throughfall is the rainfall that passes directly through spaces in the canopy and by dripping from the canopy, while stemflow is the water that runs down trunks and stems. Canopy interception loss, as mentioned, is the water that evaporates from the canopy."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to consider the typical spacing between plants when applying definitions related to the interception process over a representative area of a plant community?", "answer": "Considering the typical spacing between plants is necessary because the definitions of terms like throughfall, stemflow, and interception losses are applied over a representative area of the plant community. This ensures that the calculations of water balance components, such as net rainfall (Rn) and total interception loss (Ei), accurately reflect the conditions of the specific plant community being studied."}, {"question": "How does litter interception loss (El) contribute to the total interception loss (Ei), and what is its role in the overall water balance equation?", "answer": "Litter interception loss (El) contributes to the total interception loss (Ei) by adding to the canopy interception loss (Ec), with Ei being the sum of Ec and El. In the water balance equation, litter interception loss affects the calculation of net rainfall (Rn), as Rn equals the gross rainfall (R) minus the total interception loss (Ei), which includes both canopy and litter interception losses."}, {"question": "In the context of energy exchange, why must the difference between the latent-heat flux and the net radiation be provided by downward sensible-heat transfer during the evaporation of intercepted water?", "answer": "The difference between the latent-heat flux and the net radiation must be provided by downward sensible-heat transfer because the energy required to evaporate the intercepted water exceeds the energy available from net radiation. This additional energy is necessary to facilitate the evaporation process and is supplied by air advected from the surrounding region, highlighting the importance of energy advection in regional hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between gross rainfall (R), throughfall (Rt), stemflow (Rs), and canopy interception loss (Ec), and how does it relate to the water balance?", "answer": "The relationship between these components is given by R = Rt + Rs + Ec, indicating that the gross rainfall is the sum of the water that reaches the ground as throughfall, the water that flows down stems, and the water that is intercepted and evaporated by the canopy. This relationship is crucial for understanding the water balance, as it helps in calculating the net rainfall (Rn) by subtracting the total interception loss (Ei) from the gross rainfall (R)."}, {"question": "How does the process of interception loss, particularly the evaporation of intercepted water, influence regional air temperature, according to the provided information?", "answer": "The process of interception loss, specifically the evaporation of intercepted water, can markedly cool the air regionally. This is because the latent-heat flux associated with evaporation exceeds the energy available from net radiation, necessitating the transfer of sensible heat from the surrounding air, which in turn cools the air. This effect has been observed in several studies, underscoring the role of interception loss in regional climate regulation."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is it important to accurately account for interception loss in the water balance equation, and what are the implications of neglecting this component?", "answer": "Accurately accounting for interception loss is crucial because it significantly affects the calculation of net rainfall (Rn), which in turn"}]}
{"paragraph": "6.6.2 Field Measurement of Interception As  with  other  components  of  evapotranspira- tion,  interception  loss  cannot  be  measured  directly. The  most  common  approach  to  determining  the amounts of canopy interception loss in various plant communities  is  to  measure  gross  rainfall,  through- fall, and stemflow, and solve equation (6.60) for Ec. However, this is not a simple procedure because of: (1)  the  difficulties  in  accurately  measuring  rainfall, particularly at low rainfall intensities when intercep- tion  losses  are  relatively  large  (see  section  4.2.1.2); (2) the large spatial variability of throughfall; and (3) the difficulty and expense of measuring stemflow. Helvey  and  Patric  (1965a)  reviewed  criteria  for measuring  interception  quantities,  and  concluded that  averaging  the  catches  in  20  rain  gauges  spaced randomly  over  a  representative  portion  of  the  com- munity should give acceptable estimates of through- fall; typical intergauge spacing for forest studies is on the  order  of  10  to  30  m  (Gash  et  al.  1980).  Large plastic sheets have also been used to get an integrated measure of net rainfall (Calder and Rosier 1976). Stemflow  is  measured  by  attaching  flexible troughs  tightly  around  the  trunks  of  trees  and  con- ducting the water to rain gauges or collecting bottles. Helvey  and  Patric  (1965a)  stated  that  measuring stemflow  from  all  trees  on  randomly  selected  plots gives the most representative results, with plot diam- eters at least 1.5 times the diameter of the crown of the largest trees. However, since stemflow is usually much  less  than  throughfall,  most  studies  have  esti- mated  stemflow  less  rigorously  by  sampling  a  few “typical” trees. The few published studies of grass or litter inter- ception have usually been done using artificial rain, either  by  measuring  the  net  rainfall  from  small  iso- lated areas in the field (Merriam 1961) or by collect- ing  undisturbed  samples  of  the  surface  litter  and setting  them  on  recording  scales  in  the  laboratory (Pitman 1989; Putuhena and Cordery 1996).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of measuring interception loss, why is it challenging to directly measure gross rainfall, particularly at low rainfall intensities?", "answer": "Direct measurement of gross rainfall is challenging, especially at low rainfall intensities, because interception losses are relatively large, making it difficult to accurately quantify the amount of rainfall that actually reaches the ground. This challenge is further complicated by the spatial variability of throughfall and the expense of measuring stemflow. As a result, indirect methods such as measuring throughfall and stemflow are often used to estimate interception loss."}, {"question": "How do researchers typically measure throughfall in forest studies, and what is the recommended spacing between rain gauges?", "answer": "Researchers typically measure throughfall by averaging the catches in 20 rain gauges spaced randomly over a representative portion of the community. The recommended spacing between rain gauges for forest studies is on the order of 10 to 30 meters, as suggested by Gash et al. (1980). This approach helps to account for the large spatial variability of throughfall and provides a more accurate estimate of interception loss."}, {"question": "In the context of stemflow measurement, what method is used to collect water from tree trunks, and why is it important to measure stemflow from all trees on randomly selected plots?", "answer": "Stemflow is measured by attaching flexible troughs tightly around the trunks of trees and conducting the water to rain gauges or collecting bottles. Measuring stemflow from all trees on randomly selected plots is important because it provides the most representative results, allowing researchers to account for the variability in stemflow between different trees.

By measuring the amount of rainfall that reaches the ground, researchers can calculate the amount of water that is intercepted by the canopy. This method provides a more comprehensive understanding of the interception process and helps to improve estimates of interception loss."}, {"question": "In the context of grass or litter interception, how have researchers typically studied this process, and what methods have been used to measure interception?", "answer": "Researchers have typically studied grass or litter interception using artificial rain, either by measuring the net rainfall from small isolated areas in the field or by collecting undisturbed samples of the surface litter and setting them on recording scales in the laboratory. These methods allow researchers to quantify the amount of water that is intercepted by grass or litter and to better understand the factors that influence this process."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the spatial variability of throughfall when measuring interception loss, and how does this variability affect the accuracy of estimates?", "answer": "The spatial variability of throughfall is essential to consider when measuring interception loss because it can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates. Throughfall can vary greatly over short distances, and failing to account for this variability can lead to inaccurate estimates of interception loss. By using multiple rain gauges spaced randomly over a representative area, researchers can better capture the spatial variability of throughfall and provide more accurate estimates of interception loss."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating stemflow, why do most studies estimate it less rigorously by sampling a few \"typical\" trees, and what are the implications of this approach?", "answer": "Most studies estimate stemflow less rigorously by sampling a few \"typical\" trees because stemflow is usually much less than throughfall, and the contribution of stemflow to total interception loss is relatively small. However, this approach may lead to underestimation or overestimation of stemflow, which can affect the accuracy of interception loss estimates.

The challenges associated with each approach include the spatial variability of throughfall, the difficulty of measuring stemflow, and the need for artificial rain in grass or litter interception studies. Additionally, the use of artificial rain may not accurately represent natural rainfall conditions, and the laboratory measurements may not capture the complex interactions between the litter layer and the atmosphere."}, {"question": "In the context of measuring interception loss, what are the implications of not accounting for the large spatial variability of throughfall, and how can this variability be addressed?", "answer": "Not"}]}

A portion (k ) of the rain falls through the canopy; of the rain hitting the canopy, a small fraction (k ) runs down the trunks. The canopy storage (S ) is filled by rainfall  and  emptied  by  evaporation  (E ),  at  a  rate given  via  the  Penman–Monteith  equation  (E ),  and by drainage (D) as S D c c c c D = 0, S  < S *, where  *  is  the  canopy  storage  capacity.

This simplification reduces the data requirements and computational complexity of the model, making it potentially more preferable for certain applications, as suggested by Liu (2001), who found both models to successfully predict long-term interception losses but noted the Liu model's advantages in simplicity and data efficiency."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the number of storms on net rainfall, as illustrated by the example calculations for a central Alaskan birch forest?", "answer": "The number of storms has a significant impact on net rainfall, with an increase in the number of storms leading to a decrease in net rainfall for a given seasonal rainfall total. This relationship highlights the importance of considering not just the total amount of rainfall but also the frequency and distribution of storms when assessing hydrological processes and predicting water availability. This understanding can inform water resource management and planning, especially in regions with variable storm patterns."}, {"question": "How does the structure of vegetation influence the parameters of interception models like the Rutter-Gash model?", "answer": "The structure of vegetation, such as leaf area index, might be expected to influence the parameters of interception models. However, studies like that by Miralles et al. (2010) have found that the values of model parameters have a surprisingly small range globally, with no clear relation to forest characteristics. This suggests that while vegetation structure is a critical component of interception processes, its influence on model parameters may be more complex and less direct than anticipated, potentially simplifying the application of these models across different forest types."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological research, why is it important to develop and compare different models of interception loss, such as the Rutter-Gash and Liu models?", "answer": "Developing and comparing different models of interception loss is crucial for advancing our understanding of hydrological processes and improving the accuracy of predictions. By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various models, researchers can identify the most effective approaches for different applications and environments, ultimately contributing to better water resource management and more accurate hydrological forecasting. This comparative research also fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying processes, helping to address challenges such as the uncertain transferability of regression equations and the need for models that can simulate complex hydrological phenomena accurately."}, {"question": "What is the role of evaporation in the Rutter model, and how is it calculated?", "answer": "In the Rutter model, evaporation plays a critical role in determining interception loss. Evaporation from the canopy and trunks is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation, which provides a rate of evaporation. This evaporation, along with drainage, empties the canopy storage, influencing the overall interception loss. The model accounts for evaporation from both the canopy and trunks, reflecting the complex pathways through which water is lost from the forest ecosystem."}, {"question": "How do the findings of studies comparing the Rutter-Gash and Liu models inform the choice of model for predicting interception loss in different forest types?", "answer": "The findings of comparative studies, such as those by Liu (2001) and Buttle and Farnsworth (2012), suggest that both the Rutter-Gash and Liu models can successfully predict interception loss in various forest types.

{"paragraph": "6.6.4 Evaporation of Intercepted Water As  noted,  the  Penman  equation  [equation (6.56)] is used to calculate the rate of evaporation of intercepted water in the Rutter–Gash and Liu mod- els. This is equivalent to using the Penman–Monteith equation [equation (6.57)] with infinite canopy con- ductance, which is appropriate because the evapora- tion is from the leaf surface with no effect from the stomata. Thus only atmospheric conductance affects the evaporation rates of intercepted water, and inter- cepted water will evaporate faster than transpiration that occurs under the same conditions. Note from figure 6.13 that atmospheric conduc- tance increases markedly with vegetation height for a m/s  above  0.1-m  high  grass,  but    ≈  0.06  m/s above  10-m  high  trees.  This  is  due  to  the  effects  of surface  roughness  on  the  efficiency  of  turbulent transfer  (section  3.5.3).  Thus  for  forests  the  differ- ence  between  the  evaporation  rates  of  intercepted water  and  transpired  water  is  considerable,  as  illus- trated by the following example. In the example of box 6.5, the atmospheric con- 6B5.4), canopy conductance C  for a pine forest is 111.1 m/day (table 6B5.6), and with Δθ = 0 cm the Penman–Monteith  equation  gives  a  transpiration rate of 0.974 mm/day (table 6B5.6). With an infinite canopy conductance, equation (6.57) yields a canopy evaporation rate of 95.3 mm/day, almost 100 times greater than the transpiration rate! Thus if there is 1 mm  of  intercepted  water  on  the  canopy,  it  will  be 0.0105 day = 0.252 hr.

This means that only atmospheric conductance affects the evaporation rates of intercepted water. As a result, intercepted water will evaporate faster than transpiration under the same conditions."}, {"question": "Why does atmospheric conductance increase markedly with vegetation height for vegetation above 0.1-m high grass?", "answer": "Atmospheric conductance increases with vegetation height due to the effects of surface roughness on the efficiency of turbulent transfer. This is particularly notable for vegetation above 0.1-m high grass, where the increase in surface roughness enhances the efficiency of turbulent transfer, leading to higher atmospheric conductance. For example, above 10-m high trees, atmospheric conductance is approximately 0.06 m/s."}, {"question": "In the context of forest hydrology, what is the difference between the evaporation rates of intercepted water and transpired water?", "answer": "The difference between the evaporation rates of intercepted water and transpired water in forests is considerable. This is because the evaporation of intercepted water is only affected by atmospheric conductance, whereas transpiration is also influenced by canopy conductance. As a result, the evaporation rate of intercepted water can be significantly higher than the transpiration rate, as illustrated by the example where the evaporation rate of intercepted water is almost 100 times greater than the transpiration rate."}, {"question": "How does the contrast between rates of evaporation of intercepted water and rates of transpiration impact our understanding of hydrologic impacts of land-use changes?", "answer": "The contrast between rates of evaporation of intercepted water and rates of transpiration has an important bearing on understanding the hydrologic impacts of land-use changes. This is because land-use changes can alter the balance between evaporation and transpiration, leading to changes in the water balance and potentially affecting the overall hydrologic cycle. For instance, if land-use changes result in increased vegetation height, atmospheric conductance may increase, leading to higher evaporation rates of intercepted water and potentially altering the hydrologic impacts of the land-use change."}, {"question": "In the context of the example provided, why is the evaporation rate of intercepted water almost 100 times greater than the transpiration rate?", "answer": "The evaporation rate of intercepted water is almost 100 times greater than the transpiration rate because the Penman-Monteith equation yields a canopy evaporation rate of 95.3 mm/day with infinite canopy conductance, whereas the transpiration rate is 0.974 mm/day. This significant difference is due to the fact that the evaporation of intercepted water is only affected by atmospheric conductance, whereas transpiration is also influenced by canopy conductance, which is 111.1 m/day in this example."}, {"question": "What is the implication of having 1 mm of intercepted water on the canopy in terms of evaporation time?", "answer": "Having 1 mm of intercepted water on the canopy implies that it will evaporate quickly, in approximately 0.252 hours or 0.0105 days. This rapid evaporation is due to the high evaporation rate of intercepted water, which is almost 100 times greater than the transpiration rate. This highlights the importance of considering the evaporation of intercepted water in hydrologic studies, particularly in forests where the difference between evaporation and transpiration rates can be significant."}, {"question": "How does surface roughness affect the efficiency of turbulent transfer in the context of atmospheric conductance?", "answer": "Surface roughness affects the efficiency of turbulent transfer by enhancing the efficiency of turbulent transfer as the surface roughness increases. This is evident in the increase in atmospheric conductance with vegetation height, particularly above 0.1-m high grass. The increased surface roughness leads to more efficient turbulent transfer, resulting in higher atmospheric conductance. For example, above 10-m high trees, the atmospheric conductance is approximately 0.06 m/s, indicating a significant increase in turbulent transfer efficiency due to the increased surface roughness."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic impacts of land-use changes, why is it essential to consider the difference between evaporation and transpiration rates?", "answer": "It is essential to consider the difference between evaporation and transpiration rates because land-use changes can alter the balance between evaporation and transpiration, leading to changes in the water balance and potentially affecting the overall hydrologic cycle. The significant difference between evaporation and transpiration rates, particularly in forests, highlights the need to account for both processes when assessing the hydrologic impacts of land-use changes. By considering these differences, hydrologists can better understand the potential effects of land-use changes on the hydrologic cycle and make more informed decisions."}]}
{"paragraph": "6.6.5.1 Observed Values of Interception Loss Table 6.8 summarizes measurements of seasonal interception  loss  (Ec)  in  various  plant  communities; values range from 10 to 40% of gross precipitation. A recent study by Miralles et al.

Conversely, short-duration (convective) storms result in lower interception loss due to the shorter duration of rainfall, which limits the amount of water that can be intercepted. This relationship highlights the importance of rainfall intensity and duration in determining interception loss."}, {"question": "What is the main determinant of interception loss, as suggested by the study by Miralles et al.

This is notable because conifer forests often have dense canopies, which can lead to increased interception loss. In contrast, tropical broadleaf evergreen forests have lower interception loss (13%) compared to temperate deciduous broadleaf forests (22%), despite the latter having lower canopy cover in winter. This suggests that the relationship between forest type, canopy cover, and interception loss is complex and influenced by various factors, including climate and rainfall patterns. Understanding these relationships is crucial for accurately modeling hydrological processes and predicting water availability in different ecosystems."}, {"question": "In the context of global mapping of interception loss, what method did Miralles et al.

This variability highlights the importance of considering the specific plant community when assessing hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What are the implications of considering interception loss as an addition to transpiration versus a replacement in hydrological modeling?", "answer": "Considering interception loss as an addition to transpiration implies that the total water loss from the ecosystem is higher, which could lead to overestimation of water availability for other hydrological processes. On the other hand, viewing it as a replacement suggests that the total water loss remains constant, but the partitioning between interception and transpiration changes. This distinction has significant implications for predicting water balances, runoff generation, and groundwater recharge, underscoring the need for accurate representation of these processes in hydrological models.

Moreover, recognizing the variability of interception loss among different plant communities enables the development of more nuanced and effective water management strategies that consider the specific hydrological characteristics of each region."}, {"question": "Why is there debate concerning the extent to which interception loss adds to or replaces transpiration?", "answer": "The debate surrounding the relationship between interception loss and transpiration stems from the complexity of the processes involved and the lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms governing water use by plants. Factors such as vegetation type, climate, and soil conditions contribute to this complexity, making it challenging to generalize the relationship between interception loss and transpiration across different ecosystems. Additionally, the debate may be influenced by the methodologies used to measure and estimate interception loss and transpiration, which can introduce uncertainties and inconsistencies in the data. Therefore, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between these two processes and to develop more accurate and robust models of plant water use."}, {"question": "In the context of ecosystem hydrology, what role does interception loss play in the water balance of plant communities?", "answer": "Interception loss plays a significant role in the water balance of plant communities, as it represents a pathway for water loss that does not contribute to runoff or infiltration.

{"paragraph": "6.7.1 Conceptual Definition The concept of potential evapotranspiration was in- troduced in section 2.2.8.3 in the discussion of the ef- fects  of  climate  change  on  hydrology.  The  concept originated as part of a scheme for climate classifica- tion by Thornthwaite (1948), who intended it to de- pend essentially on climate or weather, independent of surface characteristics: Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is the rate at which evapotranspiration would occur from a large area completely and uniformly covered with growing vegetation with access to an unlimited supply of soil water and without advection or heat-storage effects (table 6.1). However, this concept is problematical because there are several characteristics of a vegetative surface that have  a  strong  influence  on  evapotranspiration  rate even  when  there  is  no  limit  to  the  available  water (see table 6.4 and figure 6.13): (1) the albedo of the surface,  which  determines  the  net  radiation;  (2)  the maximum  leaf  conductance;  (3)  the  atmospheric conductance, which is largely determined by vegeta- tion height; and (4) the presence or absence of inter- cepted  water.  Because  of  these  surface  effects, Penman (1956) suggested replacing the PET concept with reference-crop evapotranspiration: Reference-crop evapotranspiration (RET) is the amount of water transpired by a short green crop, completely shading the ground, of uniform height, and never short of water. Another  concern  about  the  concept  of  PET  is that its magnitude is often calculated from meteoro- logical data collected under conditions in which the actual evapotranspiration rate is less than the poten- tial rate. However, if evapotranspiration had been oc- curring at the potential rate, the latent- and sensible- heat exchanges between the air and the surface, and hence the air temperature and humidity, would have been considerably different (Brutsaert 1982).

A review of catchment experiments to determine the effect of vegetation changes on water yield and evapotranspiration. Journal of Hydrology 55:3–23, with permission of Elsevier]. In spite of these ambiguities, it has proven useful to retain the concept of PET as an index of the “dry- ing power” of the climate or the ambient meteorologi- cal conditions, and we now examine some operational definitions that have been applied in climate classifica- tion and hydrologic modeling.

These characteristics include the albedo of the surface, maximum leaf conductance, atmospheric conductance determined by vegetation height, and the presence or absence of intercepted water. These factors imply that PET calculations may not accurately represent actual evapotranspiration conditions, leading to potential inaccuracies in hydrologic modeling and analysis.

RET was suggested as an alternative to PET by Penman (1956) because it accounts for the surface effects that influence evapotranspiration rates, such as vegetation characteristics, which are not considered in the PET concept. This makes RET a potentially more accurate representation of evapotranspiration under specific conditions, although it still has its limitations and does not fully address the complexities of actual evapotranspiration processes."}, {"question": "What are the surface characteristics that influence evapotranspiration rates, and how do these factors impact the calculation of potential evapotranspiration?", "answer": "The surface characteristics that influence evapotranspiration rates include the albedo of the surface, maximum leaf conductance, atmospheric conductance (largely determined by vegetation height), and the presence or absence of intercepted water. These factors impact the calculation of potential evapotranspiration because they affect the net radiation, the ability of the vegetation to transpire water, and the exchange of heat and moisture between the surface and the atmosphere. As a result, calculations of PET that do not account for these surface characteristics may not accurately represent the potential evapotranspiration under actual conditions, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to estimating evapotranspiration."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating actual evapotranspiration, why is it challenging to derive accurate values from calculated potential evapotranspiration, and what are the implications for hydrologic modeling?", "answer": "Deriving accurate values of actual evapotranspiration from calculated potential evapotranspiration is challenging because the actual rate of evapotranspiration is influenced by a complex array of factors, including surface characteristics, available water, and meteorological conditions, which are not fully captured by the PET concept.

Operational definitions of PET applied in climate classification and hydrologic modeling aim to quantify this \"drying power\" through various formulas and methods that account for factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

This method considers factors such as net radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, making it more accurate than other methods that may only consider a subset of these factors.

This underestimation suggests that the equilibrium method may not fully capture the complexities of evapotranspiration processes, particularly under conditions of high energy input or water stress. In contrast, the Penman–Monteith method, which accounts for both energy balance and aerodynamic components, provides more accurate estimates across a wider range of evapotranspiration rates."}, {"question": "In the context of the Penman–Monteith equation, how is the surface conductance (C) related to the \"active\" leaf-area index and the conductance for a well-illuminated leaf (C*)?", "answer": "The surface conductance (C) is related to the \"active\" leaf-area index and the conductance for a well-illuminated leaf (C*) through the equation C = C* · LAI, where LAI is the leaf-area index. This relationship indicates that the surface conductance is directly proportional to both the conductance of a single leaf and the amount of leaf area exposed to sunlight. The \"active\" leaf-area index, which accounts for the portion of leaves exposed to sunlight, is approximated as LAI = 0.5 · LAI, reflecting the fact that not all leaves contribute equally to evapotranspiration due to shading effects."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Hamon method performing best among the various methods compared by Vörösmarty et al.

Despite its simplicity, the method's reliance on these fundamental factors allows it to capture the broad patterns of PET variability across different locations. This suggests that, at the annual scale, the basic climatic controls on evapotranspiration may be more dominant than the detailed physiological and aerodynamic processes considered in more complex methods like the Penman–Monteith equation.

This similarity suggests that, at the global scale, the fundamental processes driving PET may be captured by a range of approaches, from simple temperature-based methods like the Hamon equation to more complex energy balance and aerodynamic models like the Penman–Monteith equation. The implications of these similarities are significant, as they indicate that PET estimates may be more robust than expected, even when derived from diverse methodologies.

{"paragraph": "6.8.1.2 Monthly Water-Balance Models Thornthwaite  and  Mather  (1955)  developed  a water-balance  model  that  estimates  monthly from  monthly  PET,  where  PET  is  calculated  from monthly  average  temperature  using  equation  (6.67), equation  (6.68),  or  another  temperature-based  ap- proach.  Monthly  precipitation  is  input  to  a  simple heuristic model that computes monthly actual ET as a function of soil-moisture storage and monthly aver- age  temperature  and  updates  soil  moisture  via  a “bookkeeping” procedure. Monthly values of ET are Box 6.8 Thornthwaite-Type Monthly Water-Balance Model Thornthwaite-type monthly water-balance models are conceptual models that can be used to simulate steady-state seasonal (climatic average) or continuous values of watershed or regional water input, snowpack, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Input for such models consists of monthly values of precipitation, P , and temperature, T , representative of the region of interest. For steady-state applications, these values are for continuous simulations they are actual monthly aver- number of years of record. Such models typically have a single parameter, the soil-water storage capacity of the soil in the region, SOIL , which is defined as SOIL  = θ  · Z (6B8.1) max fc rz where θ  is the field capacity and Z  the vertical extent of the root zone. Typically SOIL  = 100 or 150 mm. For continuous applications an initial value of soil moisture, SOIL , must also be specified. All water quantities in the model represent depths (volumes per unit area) of liquid water; inputs and out- puts are monthly totals and snowpack and soil storage are end-of-month values. Snowpack, Snowmelt, and Water Input Monthly precipitation is divided into rain, RAIN , and snow, SNOW , where Chapter 6 Evapotranspiration summed to give the annual value. One version of this approach is described in detail in box 6.8, and table 6.10 and figure 6.24 (on p. 301) give an example of its application.  The  method  can  be  used  with  monthly climatic-average values of precipitation and tempera- ture, or with actual monthly values over a period of years. In spite of their extremely simple structure and empirical  nature,  models  of  the  Thornthwaite  type generally estimate monthly runoff values reasonably well  (Alley  1984;  Calvo  1986),  and  this  correspon- dence  suggests  that  their  estimates  of  actual  evapo- transpiration are also generally reasonable. “Thornthwaite-type” monthly ET models can be extended to estimate monthly ground-water recharge and runoff, and one can verify ET estimates by com- paring  estimated  and  measured  runoff.  Somewhat more elaborate versions of the basic monthly water- balance model described in box 6.8 have been used to RAIN  = F  · P , (6B8.2) and F  is the melt factor. A simple approach to calculat- ing F is F  = 0, T  ≤ 0°C; F  = 1, T  ≥ 6°C. The melt factor is also used in a temperature-index snowmelt model [equation (5.71)] to determine the monthly snowmelt, MELT , as m m m–1 m where PACK  is the snowpack water equivalent at the end of month m – 1. The snowpack at the end of month m is then computed as m m  m m  m–1 By definition, the water input, W , is W  = RAIN  + MELT .

Thus m m m m–1 max where min{...} indicates the smaller of the quantities in the braces. In the original formulation, Thornthwaite (1948) used equation (6.67) to calculate PET .

Otherwise you will get an error message: “Cannot resolve circular references.” Overall Water Balance The model output is a table of monthly values that can be graphed to give a concise picture of the annual cycle of inputs, soil and snowpack storage, evaporation, and water available for ground-water recharge and stream- flow at any location. Table 6.10 is a completed water-bal- ance spreadsheet for Omaha, Nebraska, at 41.3°N latitude; the annual values are the sums of the monthly values. Note that the annual precipitation and water input are equal, as must be the case. As shown in figure 6.24, the snowpack begins to build up in December, reaches a peak in February, and melts in March and April. ET = PET for the months when W > PET (March–June). Soil-water storage is recharged by rain and snowmelt beginning in February and reaches its capacity in April. It declines in July–Octo- ber because PET > P and some of the evaporative demand is satisfied by withdrawal of water from soil storage. The last line, W–ET–ΔSOIL, is the average monthly “water sur- plus,” i.e., the water available for recharge and runoff.

When water input (W) is greater than or equal to PET, ET occurs at the potential rate, meaning ET equals PET. Conversely, if W is less than PET, ET is determined by the sum of water input and an increment removed from soil storage, indicating that PET sets a ceiling for ET under conditions of sufficient water availability."}, {"question": "Why do Thornthwaite-type monthly water-balance models generally estimate monthly runoff values reasonably well despite their simple structure and empirical nature?", "answer": "These models estimate monthly runoff values reasonably well because they capture the essential dynamics of the water balance, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture storage. The simplicity of the models, focusing on key processes and using empirical relationships, allows them to simulate the overall water balance effectively. This is supported by studies such as those by Alley (1984) and Calvo (1986), which found a reasonable correspondence between estimated and actual runoff values, suggesting that the models' estimates of actual evapotranspiration are also generally reasonable."}, {"question": "In the context of snowpack and water input, how does the melt factor (F) influence the calculation of monthly snowmelt (MELT) in the Thornthwaite-type model?", "answer": "The melt factor (F) plays a crucial role in determining the monthly snowmelt (MELT) by influencing how much of the snowpack melts in a given month. The value of F, which can be calculated based on temperature (e.g., F = 0 for T ≤ 0°C and F = 1 for T ≥ 6°C), directly affects the amount of snowmelt.

It is defined as SOIL = θ · Z, where θ is the field capacity and Z is the vertical extent of the root zone. Typically, SOIL values range around 100 to 150 mm, indicating the soil's capacity to retain water, which in turn affects the model's estimation of ET, soil moisture, and runoff."}, {"question": "How does the Thornthwaite-type monthly water-balance model account for the annual cycle of water-balance components, such as snowpack, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration?", "answer": "The model accounts for the annual cycle by iteratively calculating monthly values of snowpack, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and other water-balance components until these values converge to constant annual patterns. This process, which can be automated in tools like Excel spreadsheets, allows the model to simulate the dynamic changes in water storage and fluxes over the course of a year, providing a comprehensive picture of the water balance at any location."}, {"question": "In the context of land-surface hydrology, why are Thornthwaite-type monthly water-balance models used in general circulation models to forecast the impacts of climate change?", "answer": "Thornthwaite-type models are used in general circulation models because they provide a simple yet effective way to simulate land-surface hydrology, which is crucial for understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources. Their ability to estimate key hydrological components such as evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture with reasonable accuracy, despite their empirical nature, makes them valuable tools for integrating into more complex climate models. This integration enables researchers to forecast how changes in climate might affect water availability, groundwater recharge, and streamflow, among other hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using climatic monthly averages versus actual monthly values of precipitation and temperature in the Thornthwaite-type model?", "answer": "Using climatic monthly averages allows the model to simulate steady-state seasonal or climatic average conditions, providing insights into long-term water balance patterns. In contrast, using actual monthly values enables the simulation of continuous, year-to-year variations in water balance components, which can be useful for understanding interannual variability and the impacts of specific weather events. The choice between these approaches depends on the research question and the desired level of detail in the water balance simulation."}]}

If these con- ditions  remained  constant,  eventually  the  soil  mois- ture would fall below field capacity and ET would be less than PET alent to the difference between PET  and ET would then  not  be  used  for  evapotranspiration,  and  would become available to warm the atmosphere. Thus The  reduced  evapotranspiration  decreases  the humidity and the warming increases the air tempera- ture.

Figure 7.1 shows terms describing water paths in porous  subsurface  materials.  If  the  soil  pores  at  the surface  are  not  completely  filled  with  water,  a  por- tion of rain and snowmelt enters the soil via the pro- cess of infiltration, where it is subject to the forces of gravity and pressure. Gravity is, of course, omnipres- ent and constant and directed downward. The pores of  soils  in  the  (also  called  the unsaturated  zone vadose1 zone) contain air and water; pressure forces are  due  to  surface  tension  (section  1.5.3)  and  pres- sures  are  less  than  atmospheric.  Pressure  gradients arise  due  to  spatial  variations  in  water  content, which operate at scales up to ~0.01 m and can act in any direction, resulting in redistribution, evaporation at the soil surface (exfiltration), downslope flow (in- terflow),  or  downward  flow  to  an  underlying rated zone. Water moving vertically downward arrives at the saturated zone as ground-water recharge. The wa- ter table is the fluctuating upper boundary of the sat- urated  zone,  at  which  pressure  is  atmospheric.  Soil pores in the saturated zone are completely filled with water  and  pressures  are  greater  than  atmospheric due to the weight of the overlying water. The combi- nation of pressure- and gravity-force gradients move water  generally  from  higher  to  lower  elevations  at scales  >>  1  m,  but  local  flow  directions  may  range from vertically downward to vertically upward. This  chapter  introduces  the  basic  physics  of  the storage and movement of water in porous earth mate- rials (porous media). Chapter 8 focuses on the appli- cation of these principles to the process of infiltration and  redistribution  in  the  unsaturated  zone,  typically at vertical scales of ~ 1 m and horizontal scales of up to 103 · m2.

This increase in density with depth can affect the soil's water-holding capacity and permeability, influencing groundwater flow and recharge rates. Understanding this relationship is vital for accurately modeling hydrological processes and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "In the context of soil composition, why does bulk density increase with depth?", "answer": "Bulk density increases with depth primarily because of the compaction effect caused by the weight of overlying soil layers. Additionally, the decrease in organic matter with depth contributes to this increase in density. Organic matter tends to have a lower density than mineral soil components, so as its proportion decreases with depth, the overall density of the soil increases. This change in composition affects the soil's hydrological properties, such as its ability to retain water and facilitate infiltration."}, {"question": "What is the definition of dry density in the context of soil science?", "answer": "Dry density, denoted as , is defined as the density of the soil when it is completely dry (V = 0), which means it is the mass of the soil solids per unit volume of the soil, excluding any water content."}, {"question": "How does the presence of organic matter influence soil bulk density?", "answer": "The presence of organic matter in the soil tends to decrease its bulk density because organic matter generally has a lower density than the mineral components of the soil. As the amount of organic matter decreases with depth, the bulk density of the soil increases. This relationship highlights the importance of considering soil composition when analyzing hydrological processes and properties."}, {"question": "In hydrologic modeling, what are the implications of assuming constant bulk density with time?", "answer": "Assuming constant bulk density with time simplifies hydrologic modeling by reducing the complexity associated with temporal changes in soil properties. However, this assumption might not always be valid, particularly in scenarios where significant land use changes, soil erosion, or compaction occur. The implications of this assumption include potential inaccuracies in predicting water balance, groundwater flow, and soil moisture content, which can affect the overall reliability of hydrologic models."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the variation of bulk density with depth crucial in hydrology?", "answer": "Understanding how bulk density varies with depth is crucial because it affects the soil's hydrological properties, such as water-holding capacity, permeability, and infiltration rates. Accurate knowledge of these properties is essential for predicting groundwater recharge, runoff generation, and soil moisture dynamics, all of which are critical components of hydrologic modeling and water resource management. The variation in bulk density with depth can significantly impact the movement and storage of water in the soil, influencing both surface and subsurface hydrological processes."}, {"question": "In the context of soil hydrology, what challenges arise from changes in bulk density due to compaction?", "answer": "Changes in bulk density due to compaction can lead to several challenges in soil hydrology, including reduced infiltration rates, increased runoff, and altered groundwater recharge patterns. Compaction can also decrease the soil's water-holding capacity, potentially affecting plant growth and ecosystem health. These changes can have significant implications for water resource management, requiring adjustments in irrigation practices, drainage systems, and conservation strategies to mitigate the effects of compaction on soil hydrological properties."}, {"question": "How does the concept of dry density relate to the overall density of the soil?", "answer": "Dry density is a component of the overall density of the soil, which also includes the density of water when the soil is not completely dry. The overall density is a function of both the dry density of the soil solids and the volume of water present in the soil pores. Understanding dry density is essential for calculating the overall density and for analyzing hydrological processes that depend on the soil's water content and composition."}, {"question": "In hydrologic situations, why is it important to consider the spatial distribution of bulk density?", "answer": "Considering the spatial distribution of bulk density is important because it can significantly affect the hydrological behavior of the soil. Variations in bulk density across different layers or areas can influence water flow paths, infiltration rates, and groundwater recharge, leading to heterogeneous hydrological responses. This spatial variability must be accounted for in hydrologic modeling to accurately predict water movement and storage, ensuring effective water resource management and planning."}]}

This process removes any moisture that may be present in the soil, allowing for a precise calculation of the soil's weight per unit volume. The temperature of 105°C is specifically chosen because it is high enough to evaporate all the moisture from the soil without causing any significant chemical or physical changes to the soil structure."}, {"question": "In the context of soil analysis, how does the measurement of bulk density relate to understanding soil properties?", "answer": "The measurement of bulk density is essential in understanding soil properties because it provides insight into the soil's composition and structure. Bulk density is a critical parameter in determining the soil's water-holding capacity, aeration, and root penetration, among other properties. By knowing the bulk density, hydrologists and soil scientists can better understand how the soil will behave under different conditions, such as rainfall or irrigation, which is vital for managing water resources and predicting hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the original volume in the calculation of bulk density, and why is it important to maintain it during the measurement process?", "answer": "The original volume is significant in the calculation of bulk density because it serves as the reference volume against which the weight of the dried soil is compared. Maintaining the original volume during the measurement process is crucial to ensure that the calculated bulk density accurately represents the soil's properties.

This standardized approach allows for the comparison of bulk density values across different soils and conditions, providing a consistent basis for understanding and predicting soil behavior. By removing all moisture, the method effectively normalizes the soil to a common state, enabling the accurate calculation of bulk density regardless of the initial moisture content."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is accurate measurement of bulk density important for predicting water movement through soils?", "answer": "Accurate measurement of bulk density is important for predicting water movement through soils because it directly affects the soil's hydraulic properties, such as permeability and water-holding capacity. Bulk density influences how water infiltrates, percolates, and is retained within the soil, which are critical processes in hydrological modeling. An accurate bulk density value helps in simulating these processes more realistically, leading to better predictions of groundwater recharge, runoff, and soil moisture dynamics, all of which are essential for water resource management and hydrological forecasting."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using a bulk density measurement method that does not account for soil moisture content variations?", "answer": "Using a bulk density measurement method that does not account for soil moisture content variations can lead to significant errors in understanding soil properties and predicting hydrological processes. Such a method would not provide a consistent basis for comparison across different soils and conditions, potentially leading to mismanagement of water resources. The implications include inaccurate predictions of water infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge, which can have profound effects on agricultural productivity, ecosystem health, and water supply management. Therefore, it is crucial to use a standardized method like drying at 105°C to ensure that bulk density measurements are reliable and applicable for hydrological analyses."}, {"question": "How does the temperature of 105°C affect the soil structure during the bulk density measurement process?", "answer": "The temperature of 105°C is chosen for drying the soil because it is high enough to evaporate all moisture without causing significant chemical or physical changes to the soil structure. At this temperature, the water molecules in the soil are evaporated, leaving the soil's mineral and organic components intact. This preservation of the soil structure is critical for maintaining the soil's original properties, ensuring that the measured bulk density accurately represents the soil's characteristics in its natural state. The choice of 105°C as the drying temperature is a balance between removing moisture and preserving the soil's structural integrity, which is essential for reliable bulk density measurements."}, {"question": "In the context of soil science, what is the relationship between bulk density and soil porosity, and how does this relationship impact hydrological processes?", "answer": "Bulk density is"}]}

Therefore, it's essential to validate this assumption with field observations and measurements to ensure accurate predictions and modeling outcomes."}, {"question": "How do near-surface biologic activities influence soil porosity, and what are the resulting effects on hydrologic processes?", "answer": "Near-surface biologic activities, such as root growth and soil fauna, create macropores that increase soil porosity near the surface. This increase in porosity enhances water infiltration and aeration, promoting healthy plant growth and microbial activity. However, the presence of these macropores can also lead to preferential flow paths, which may bypass the soil matrix and reduce the effectiveness of water retention and filtration. As a result, understanding the impact of biologic activities on soil porosity is vital for managing soil health and optimizing hydrologic functions."}, {"question": "In the context of soil compaction, why does porosity decrease with depth, and what are the hydrologic implications?", "answer": "Porosity decreases with depth due to soil compaction, which reduces the volume of pore spaces available for water storage and transmission. This decrease in porosity can lead to reduced water infiltration, increased runoff, and decreased groundwater recharge. Furthermore, compacted soils may exhibit reduced aeration and increased waterlogging, which can negatively impact plant growth and soil biota. Therefore, understanding the effects of compaction on soil porosity is essential for mitigating these hydrologic and environmental impacts."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between porosity and the presence of macropores in soils, and how does this relationship affect hydrologic processes?", "answer": "The presence of macropores in soils is closely related to porosity, as these large pores contribute significantly to the overall porosity of the soil. Macropores can enhance water infiltration and preferential flow, but they can also lead to bypass flow, reducing the soil's water retention capacity. The relationship between porosity and macropores is complex, and understanding this interaction is crucial for predicting hydrologic processes, such as infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic modeling, how does the assumption of constant porosity over time impact the accuracy of predictions?", "answer": "The assumption of constant porosity over time can impact the accuracy of hydrologic predictions, as it may not account for changes in soil properties due to land use changes, soil erosion, or other disturbances. If porosity changes over time, the model may not accurately capture the dynamics of water movement through the soil, leading to errors in predicting infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge. Therefore, it's essential to validate the assumption of constant porosity with field observations and measurements to ensure accurate modeling outcomes."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider both porosity and bulk density when analyzing hydrologic processes in soils?", "answer": "Considering both porosity and bulk density is essential because they are interconnected properties that influence the soil's hydrologic behavior. Porosity affects the soil's water-holding capacity and aeration, while bulk density impacts the soil's water infiltration and retention. Understanding the relationship between these properties is crucial for predicting hydrologic processes, such as infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge, and for managing soil health and optimizing hydrologic functions."}]}

This open structure allows for more pore space, resulting in higher porosity. In contrast, coarser-grained soils like sands have a more closely packed grain-to-grain architecture, leading to lower porosity. The arrangement of particles in finer-grained soils contributes to their ability to retain more water and have higher water-holding capacities."}, {"question": "In the context of calculating bulk density, porosity, and water content, what is the significance of determining the sample volume?", "answer": "Determining the sample volume is crucial because it allows for the calculation of bulk density, porosity, and water content.

The theoretical range of θ is from 0 (completely dry) to (saturation), but, as will be seen later, the lower limit for natural soils is greater than 0.

{"paragraph": "7.2.1.2 Measurement Standard  laboratory  measurements  of  small (~100  g)  soil  samples  are  made  by  the gravimetric method: A small soil sample of known volume V  is collected  in  the  field,  weighed,  oven-dried  at  105°C for 24 hr, and reweighed. θ is calculated as swet sdry where    and    are  the  soil  masses  (weights) swet sdry before and after drying, respectively.

Restrictions on the use of radioac- tive materials are increasingly stringent, so use of this technology is decreasing. Gamma-ray instruments consist of a radioactive source surrounded by a beam collimator that can be lowered into the soil at a fixed location. A detector mea- sures the absorption of gamma rays by water molecules in the soil between a source and a detector. Readings are unaffected by the state of the soil water. Restrictions on the use of radioactive materials are increasingly strin- gent, so use of this technology has decreased. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measures the propagation velocity of very short electromagnetic energy pulses sent through a probe. The pulse velocity decreases with soil-moisture content due to the rela- tively large dielectric value of water (Topp et al. 1980; Zegelin et al. 1989; Roth et al. 1990; Jacobsen and Schjønning 1993; Yu et al. 1997). Frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) is similar to TDR, but measures soil-moisture content based on variation in the frequency of a radio-frequency signal that depends on the dielectric properties, which in turn depend on water content (Bell et al. 1987; Dean et al. 1987; Eller and Denoth 1996). Capacitance probes determine water content by measuring the electrical capacitance between soil- implanted electrodes. Heat pulse probes consist of thin (approximately 1 mm) heater and temperature probes mounted in paral- lel with a 6-mm separation distance. A short-duration heat pulse is applied and the temperature response is recorded. The soil heat capacity and water content can then be estimated from theoretical heat-flow relations. Sayde et al. (2010) explored a promising technique that uses fiber-optic cables as thermal sensors to passively measure propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. These cables can be more than 10 km long, with measurements every 1 m. Tensiometers are probes that measure the moisture potential as a function of the pressure (suction) force exerted on water by soil. These instruments are described more fully in section 7.4.3.1. The water con- tent is determined from the pressure-water content rela- tion, which is discussed in section 7.4.3.2. Geophysical Methods The geophysical methods described below are ground-based techniques that provide measurements of water content over transects or areas, which is usually essential for hydrologic analysis. Robinson et al. (2008) provide more detail on these methods, and also describe mobile TDR systems mounted on all-terrain vehicles that can provide similar spatial information. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) uses the transmis- sion and reflection of high-frequency (1 MHz–1 GHz) electromagnetic waves within the subsurface to esti- mate θ to depths of up to tens of meters, depending on water content and soil texture. A simple application of GPR involves measuring the travel time of a direct ground wave from source to antenna through the sur- face layer to measure θ along transects. GPR can also be used in a surface-based system, where the transmitter and receiver antennas are moved across the surface, or where the antennas are positioned in boreholes. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) instruments mea- sure ground electrical conductivity between a transmitter loop and a receiver. The greater the spacing of the loops, the deeper the penetration into the ground. This method is well suited for field use and can be linked to global positioning systems to provide detailed water-content data over areas as large as 500 ha (Robinson et al. 2008). Direct-current resistivity is measured via evenly spaced electrodes inserted in the ground along a line, typically at 0.5- to 5-m spacing. Although resistivity depends on soil properties as well as water content, new electronic advances make the technique highly useful for monitoring spatial processes, and when calibrated or linked to point measurements with water-content sen- Chapter 7 Principles of Subsurface Flow sors, it can provide strong insight into subsurface pro- cesses, including changes in θ (Robinson et al. 2008). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) determines water content via the response of hydrogen nuclei to magnetic fields. Paetzold et al. (1985) developed and tested a system consisting of an electromagnet, detec- tion coil, and tuning capacitor that was tractor-mounted to provide a continuous measurement of water content at depths to 63 mm. Remote-Sensing Methods Remote-sensing measurements are made by instru- ments not in contact with the ground, and involve crane-, aircraft- or satellite-mounted detection of elec- tromagnetic fields whose strength is correlated with water content. The methods discussed here can provide measurements at the field-plot or small-watershed scale; methods based on detection of gravity fields can resolve water contents only at scales larger than 600 to 1,000 km (see section 1.8.2.4). The review by Robinson et al. (2008) provides more detail on these methods. Passive microwave measurements use radiometers , of the land to measure the brightness temperature, Ŧ surface. Brightness temperature is related to surface temperature, Ŧ , as = ε · Ŧ , (7B2.1) where ε is emissivity. At infrared wavelengths, ε = 1, so those wavelengths can be used to determine the temper- ature, Ŧ , of a very thin (< 0.001 m) surface layer. At micro- wave wavelengths (~ 0.01 to 0.20 m), ε is approximately an inverse linear function of θ, but it also depends on soil tex- ture, the surface roughness, vegetation, the angle of view, and the wave polarization (horizontal or vertical). The emitted microwave flux “sees” water content over depths of from 0.02 to 0.2 m. Water content can be mapped at scales of tens to hundreds of meters from aircraft, and tens of kilometers from satellites. However, infrared radiation cannot pass through clouds. Approaches to accounting for the effect of vegetation are described by Robinson et al. (2008). Piles et al. (2010) present an in-depth study of the retrieval configurations and ancillary data needed for the retrieval of soil moisture by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission of the European Space Agency, which was launched in November 2009. Active microwave (radar) measurements determine soil-water content by emitting a radiation flux and measur- ing the ratio of flux reflected by the surface to that emit- ted. Radiation at low radar frequencies can integrate water content over depths of ~0.05 m, can pass through clouds and low-density vegetation, and can be used at night as well as during the day. Aircraft-mounted radar can map at scales of tens to hundreds of meters, while minimum satel- lite-borne radar resolution is on the order of a kilometer.

{"paragraph": "7.3.1 Darcy’s Law The law governing water flow through a porous medium  was  discovered  in  1856  by  Henri  Darcy,  a French engineer. As a basis for designing a sand-fil- tration system for the water supply of the city of Di- jon,  Darcy  did  experiments  on  flow  through saturated sand using an apparatus like that shown in figure 7.8. His results can be summarized in the rela- tion now known as Darcy’s law: ∫ = -K , where    [L  is  the  discharge,  which  is specific [L3 T–1], per unit area of the volume rate of flow, Q porous medium at right angles to the x-direction, A of  the  medium  in saturated  hydraulic  conductivity the x-direction; and dh/dx is the gradient of total hy- head,  h,  of  the  fluid  in  the  x-direction.  The minus  sign  indicates  that  flow  moves  from  higher values of h to lower values. Hydraulic head (usually called simply “head”) represents the fluid potential, which is the mechanical energy per unit weight of fluid is the gradient of potential energy that induces the flow. Chapter 7 Principles of Subsurface Flow Figure 7.8 A simple experimental device illustrat- ing the terms in Darcy’s law [equation (7.9)]. The tubes measuring water levels at points 1 and 2 are piezometers. The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to “upstream” and “downstream” points, respectively. At a point, hydraulic head is the sum of (1) gravitational head, given by the elevation of the point above an arbitrary horizontal is equal to the pressure of the fluid at the point, p [F L–2], divided by the weight density of the fluid, γ [F L–3]; thus = + y = + . Pressure  is  conventionally  measured  as pressure,  which  is  the  difference  between  actual pressure and atmospheric pressure. As noted earlier, pressures in saturated porous media are greater than atmospheric,  so  that  p  >  0  and  >  0  in  saturated flow.  For  a  fluid  of  constant  density  (which  we  as- sume throughout this chapter), The total head z + ψ at a “point” in a saturated flow can be measured as the height above an arbitrary datum to which water rises in a piezometer, which is a tube connecting the point to the atmosphere (see figure 7.8). Part III: Water Movement on the Land law can be written as = -K = -K + dx Îdx dx The actual flow of water through a porous medium is extremely complex, with individual tiny “parcels” of water flowing with varying velocities along tortu- ous paths through the pores. In contrast, note that Darcy’s law describes the bulk flow in a particular direction through a “small” volume that is representative of the local medium, over which interpore and intrapore variations of velocity are averaged. This  hypothetical  “small”  volume  is  called  a repre- sentative elementary volume (REV); its dimensions are  on  the  order  of  several  grain  diameters.

{"paragraph": "7.3.3 Permeability and Hydraulic Conductivity Consider  again  the  experiment  of  figure  7.8. Suppose  the  experiment  was  run  twice  with  water under identical head gradients, first using a medium of uniform spheres of diameter d = 1 mm, and then with  d  4  mm.  It  is  intuitively  clear  that  the  flow rate q would be larger for the larger particles because water  would  move  more  rapidly  through  larger pores.  Now  imagine  that  the  experiment  was  re- peated with d = 1 mm, but first with water and then with  a  fluid  with  a  higher  viscosity,  like  motor  oil, maintaining  the  same  head  gradient  for  both  flows. Again,  it’s  clear  that  the  flow  rate  would  be  higher for the water flow. Thus we see that the hydraulic conductivity de- pends on both the nature of the medium and the na- ture of the fluid. The relationship is K C d C d where d is  average grain  diameter, g  is  gravitational acceleration, ρ is fluid mass density, μ is dynamic vis- ν  (≡  μ/ρ), cosity,  is  kinematic  viscosity  and  C  is  a proportionality  parameter  that  depends  on  proper- ties of the medium such as grain shape, size distribu- tion, and packing.

However, conduc tivities measured in permeameters may differ greatly from field values because: (1) it is often diffi- cult  to  avoid  disturbing  the  structure  of  materials when transferring samples to a permeameter and (2) Figure 7.9 Ranges of saturated hydraulic conductivities for various geologic materials [Heath (1982)]. Chapter 7 Principles of Subsurface Flow conductivities measured in small samples do not in- clude the effects of fractures and larger-scale geologic variability,  and  hence  are  generally  smaller  than  ef- fective regional-scale values. Larger-scale values of K  can be measured in the field  by  pumping  water  from  a  well  and  observing the rate at which water level changes in one or more nearby  observation  wells.  Details  of  these  methods can be found in most ground-water–hydrology texts (e.g., Todd and Mays 2014).

{"paragraph": "7.4.1.2 Capillary Rise and the Tension-Saturated Zone Consider a small (diameter of a few millimeters or less) cylindrical tube immersed in a body of water with a surface at atmospheric pressure (figure 7.12). If the material of the tube is such that the hydrogen bonds of the water are attracted to it, the molecules in contact with the tube are drawn upward. The de- gree of attraction between the water and the tube is reflected  in  the  angle  between  the  upper edge of the water surface, or meniscus, and the tube: the stronger the attraction, the smaller the angle. Be- cause of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the en- tire  mass of  water within the tube is drawn upward until the adhesive force between the molecules of the tube and those of the water is balanced by the down- ward force due to the weight of the water suspended within the tube. The  height  to  which  the  water  will  rise  in  the tube can thus be calculated by equating the upward and downward forces.

{"paragraph": "7.4.3.1 Measurement Piezometers cannot be used to measure h in the unsaturated zone. Instead, the pressure head ψ of soil moisture under field conditions is measured by tensi- ometers (figure 7.14). These devices consist of a hol- low metal tube, one end of which is closed off by a cup of porous ceramic material and the other end is fitted with a removable air-tight seal. A manometer, vacuum gauge, or pressure transducer is attached to the  tube.  The  tube  is  inserted  into  the  soil  to  the depth  of  measurement  and  filled  with  water.  Since the water in the tube is initially at a pressure above at- mospheric, there is a pressure-induced flow through the porous cup into the unsaturated soil that contin- ues until the (negative) pressure inside the tube equil- ibrates and equals that in a roughly spherical region immediately surrounding the cup. The value of ψ is then read on the manometer or gauge and h is deter- mined  by  adding  that  value  to  the  elevation  of  the point,  z.

{"paragraph": "7.4.3.2 Pressure–Water-Content Relations The relation between pressure head, |ψ|, (often plotted on a logarithmic scale) and given soil is its moisture-characteristic curve.

The non-linear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and water content means that the water balance can be highly sensitive to changes in water content, particularly near saturation. This sensitivity can lead to rapid changes in water movement and storage, highlighting the importance of accurately characterizing the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation in hydrological models."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, why is it important to account for the differences in hydraulic conductivity-water content relations among soils of different textures?", "answer": "Accounting for the differences in hydraulic conductivity-water content relations among soils of different textures is essential in hydrological modeling because it allows for more accurate predictions of water movement and storage. Soils with different textures have distinct hydraulic properties, and neglecting these differences can lead to significant errors in model predictions. By incorporating texture-specific hydraulic conductivity-water content relations, models can better capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of soil water systems, leading to improved predictions of hydrological processes such as infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge."}, {"question": "What are the challenges in modeling the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation, especially in soils with complex textures?", "answer": "Modeling the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation can be challenging, especially in soils with complex textures, due to the non-linear and heterogeneous nature of the relationship. The presence of hysteresis, although less marked in the hydraulic conductivity relation, can still introduce uncertainty and complexity. Additionally, the large variability in hydraulic conductivity values among different soils and textures requires careful characterization and parameterization of the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation. These challenges highlight the need for advanced modeling approaches and detailed field measurements to accurately capture the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation in diverse soil types."}, {"question": "How does the understanding of hydraulic conductivity-water content relations inform strategies for managing soil water resources?", "answer": "The understanding of hydraulic conductivity-water content relations is crucial for managing soil water resources effectively. By recognizing the non-linear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and water content, managers can develop strategies to optimize water use and minimize waste. For example, irrigation scheduling can be tailored to take advantage of the increased hydraulic conductivity at higher water contents, reducing the amount of water required for crop growth. Additionally, understanding the differences in hydraulic conductivity-water content relations among soils can inform decisions on soil selection and management practices, such as tillage and mulching, to improve water infiltration and reduce runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of water movement on land, why is it essential to consider the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation in understanding the dynamics of water infiltration and redistribution?", "answer": "Considering the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation is essential for understanding the dynamics of water infiltration and redistribution because it directly influences the rate and pathways of water movement in soils. The hydraulic conductivity-water content relation controls the partitioning of infiltrating water between runoff and infiltration, as well as the subsequent redistribution of water within the soil profile. By accounting for this relation, researchers and managers can better understand the complex interactions between soil, water, and vegetation, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions of hydrological processes and improved management of water resources."}, {"question": "How does the hydraulic conductivity-water content relation impact the prediction of groundwater recharge and discharge?", "answer": "The hydraulic conductivity-water content relation significantly impacts the prediction of groundwater recharge and discharge, as it influences the rate at which water can move through the"}]}

Analytical approximations of ψ(θ) and K (θ) re- lations  have  been  proposed  by  Brooks  and  Corey these  are  summarized  in  table  7.2  on  p.  336.  Note that all these models are single-valued functions that ignore  hysteresis.  The  van  Genuchten  model  is  the most  widely  used;  note  that  it  models  the  complete moisture-characteristic  curve  except  for  the  point corresponding to θ*  = 1, for which ψ = 0.

In the van Genuchten model, the parameters θ  and α should be  viewed  as  “fitting  parameters”  whose  values  are chosen so that the modeled curves provide a best fit to  measured  values:    is  typically  somewhat  less than  the  actual  porosity  ,  reflecting  the  fact  that field soils typically do not reach full saturation due to air entrapped in pores; α may approximate but does not equal the inverse of the air-entry tension, 1/ψ Figure  7.19  on  p.  336  shows  the  fit  of  the  Brooks– Corey  and  van  Genuchten  models  to  the  measure- ments  of  the  moisture-characteristic  relation  for  a sand soil. 7.4.6 ψ(θ) and K (θ) Relations and Soil Texture The parameters of the models in table 7.2 (b, n, , α, θ , θ* , ψ ,  ) depend primarily on the h r vG ae soil  grain-size  distribution  (texture),  but  also  on  or- ganic  content,  chemistry,  and  other  factors  (Clapp and  Hornberger  1978;  Cosby  et  al.  1984;  Mishra  et al.  1989;  Rawls  et  al.  1992;  Wösten  et  al.  2001). There are two basic approaches used to relate model parameters to texture: 1. functions  (PTFs)  are  continuous Pedotransfer functions  that  relate  soil-hydraulic  parameters  to measured soil properties such as bulk density and the  proportions  of  clay,  silt,  sand,  and  organic matter (carbon). The functions are established by regression-type analyses of large data sets. 2. classes  are  discontinuous  catego- Soil-hydraulic ries,  each  with  a  characteristic  suite  of  soil- hydraulic  parameters.  The  categories  are  deter- mined by the proportions of clay, silt, and sand, as in the soil-texture triangle. Table 7.3 on p. 337 gives an example of PTFs for the van Genuchten parameters; others can be found Loosvelt et al. (2011). PTFs can be “mapped” on the soil-texture  triangle,  as  shown  in  figure  7.20  on  p.

Note that the vertical axis gives the base-10 logarithm of the hydraulic conductiv- ity expressed in cm/s. Curves are based on typical values given by Clapp and Horn- berger (1978). 337.  Wösten  et  al.  (2001)  extensively  reviewed  the derivation  and  application  of  PTFs  and  concluded that, although significant variability and uncertainty in  some  of  the  relationships  must  be  recognized, they are a “powerful tool” for predicting soil-hydrau- lic properties. Table  7.4  on  p.  338  gives  the  Brooks–Corey  and Campbell  parameters  for  various  soil  textures  (figure 7.5).  The  most  recent  exploration  of  soil-hydraulic classes  was  by  Twarakavi  et  al.  (2010)  using  the  van Genuchten model. They estimated the parameters (n, ) as functions of fraction of sand, silt, and clay, then used objective methods to determine the optimal number of soil-hydraulic classes for estimating the  suite  of  values.  These  turned  out  to  be  the  12 classes shown on the soil-hydraulic triangle of figure 7.21 on p. 338: Sand-dominated soils are represented by the letter A, with a number that increases (from 1 to 4) as  the  sand fraction  decreases;  silt-dominated  soils are  represented  by  “B”;  and  clay-dominated  soils  by “C”, also with numbers ranging from 1 to 4. Interest- ingly,  the  optimal  soil-hydraulic  classification  is  very similar  to  the  soil-texture  classification,  especially  for soils in which the sand fraction is dominant; the simi- larities  between  the  soil-texture  triangle  and  the  soil- hydraulic  triangle  are  less  pronounced  for  finer  soils, where capillary forces have a greater impact on the wa- Table 7.2 Analytic Approximations of ψ(θ) and K (θ) Relations.

The average values and standard deviations of the van Genuchten parameters for each soil-hydraulic class are given in table 7.5. The relative uncertainty in these relations, reflected in the standard deviations, is quite large, especially for saturated hydraulic conduc- tivity.

Understanding  these  linked processes is an essential basis for forecasting and pre- dicting  hydrologic  response  to  rain  or  snowmelt events: Water that does not infiltrate typically moves relatively  quickly  as  flow  toward  a  stream overland channel  and  contributes  to  short-term  stream  re- sponse, perhaps causing soil erosion and flooding. In contrast,  infiltrated  water  either  (1)  moves,  usually much  more  slowly,  to  the  surface-water  system  via underground paths, (2) is retained in the soil and ul- timately evapotranspired, or (3) becomes ground-wa- ter  recharge.  Crucial  aspects  of  water-resource management  require  understanding  of  these  pro- cesses,  including  developing  strategies  for  crop  irri- gation and the movement of contaminants to ground and surface waters. Other  aspects  of  the  redistribution  of  water  in the  unsaturated  zone  (see  figure  7.1)  are  discussed elsewhere: exfiltration (soil evaporation) (chapter 6), uptake  by  plant  roots  (transpiration)  (chapter  6), Infiltration and ground-water  recharge  (chapter  9),  and  interflow (chapter 10).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of unsaturated flow, what is the significance of the Richards equation, and how does it differ from the general saturated-flow equation?", "answer": "The Richards equation is a fundamental equation in hydrology that describes the movement of water in unsaturated soils. It differs from the general saturated-flow equation in that it accounts for the change in water content in the control volume in response to a change in head, rather than the compressibility of the medium or fluid.

{"paragraph": "8.1.1 Field Capacity If  a  soil  is  saturated  and  then  allowed  to  drain without being subject to evapotranspiration, its wa- ter  content  will  decrease  indefinitely  in  a  quasi-ex- ponential  manner,  following  Darcy’s  law  [equation (7.26)], which can be written for vertical downward unsaturated flow as where z′ is the vertical down-directed coordinate, q (θ) is the is the vertical downward flow rate, K hy- draulic conductivity, θ is the water content, and ψ(θ) is  the  pressure  head.  An  example  of  gravity  drain- age is shown in figure 8.1: Note that the water con- tent  is  still  decreasing  after  156  days  of  drainage, although the drainage rate also declines quasi-expo- nentially  and  becomes  negligible  within  at  most  a few days. Part III: Water Movement on the Land Thus although gravity drainage is an indefinitely continuing  process,  it  has  proven  useful  to  define  a soil’s field capacity: Field capacity, θ , is the water-content at which the gravity-drainage rate becomes “negligible.” The field capacity is thus a measure of the water con- tent  that  can  be  held  against  the  force  of  gravity; when  water  content  reaches  this  point,  downward movement essentially ceases, and water content can only be further reduced by evapotranspiration.

Because gravity drainage  in real  soils continues indefinitely,  it  is  impractical  to  define  field  capacity as the water content when q  = 0, and various opera- tional  definitions  of  field  capacity  have  been  pro- posed:  (1)  the  water  content  remaining  after  a specified number of days of drainage (typically three days  for  sandy  soils  and  six  or  more  days  for  finer- grained soils); (2) the water content corresponding to a  specific  tension  (commonly  =  –33  kPa  =  –340 cm); or (3) the water content corresponding to a spe- cific  small  drainage  rate.  The  last  of  these  is  most consistent  with  the  conceptual  definition,  and  after examining  various  possibilities,  Twarakavi  et  al.

When water content reaches this point, downward movement essentially ceases, and water content can only be further reduced by evapotranspiration."}, {"question": "Why does gravity drainage in real soils continue indefinitely, and what implications does this have for defining field capacity?", "answer": "Gravity drainage in real soils continues indefinitely because the drainage rate declines quasi-exponentially but never actually reaches zero.

Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils The water table is at atmospheric pressure; it is the  level  at  which  water  would  stand  in  a  well.  In general, the water table rises and falls in response to seasonal climatic variations and to recharge from in- dividual  storm  events.  In  arid  regions  it  may  be  at depths of many tens of meters, while elsewhere (e.g., where the soil is developed in a thin layer of glacial till  overlying  dense  crystalline  bedrock),  there  may be no water table in the soil all or most of the time.

This dynamic nature of the water table is crucial for understanding groundwater behavior and its interaction with surface water systems. The fluctuations in the water table level can significantly impact the availability of groundwater for human consumption, agriculture, and ecosystems, highlighting the importance of considering these variations in water resource management."}, {"question": "In arid regions, why may the water table be at depths of many tens of meters?", "answer": "In arid regions, the water table may be at great depths due to low precipitation rates, which result in minimal recharge to the groundwater system. This, combined with high evaporation rates, leads to a deep water table. The depth of the water table in such regions poses significant challenges for accessing groundwater, requiring deeper wells or more extensive water supply infrastructure, which can be costly and logistically complex."}, {"question": "What are the primary ways water may enter or leave the upper ground-water zone?", "answer": "Water may enter the upper ground-water zone as flow from below in a ground-water discharge zone or as recharge from above.

They play a critical role in the overall hydrological cycle, with discharge zones contributing to the output of groundwater into streams, rivers, and lakes, and recharge zones replenishing the groundwater system. Understanding the dynamics of these zones is essential for managing groundwater resources sustainably, as it helps in predicting groundwater levels, quality, and flow rates, which are vital for various human activities and environmental health. The balance between discharge and recharge zones can significantly impact the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources, making their study crucial for hydrological research and water resource planning."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater movement, what is the significance of the water table being at atmospheric pressure?", "answer": "The water table being at atmospheric pressure is significant because it marks the level at which water would stand in a well, serving as a reference point for measuring groundwater depth and pressure.

This movement maintains the zone's thickness at a value determined by the air-entry tension, ψ, which is equal to the height of capillary rise. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the zone's characteristics, such as its saturation and pressure distribution, are preserved despite changes in water input or output."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the air-entry tension, ψ, in the context of the tension-saturated zone?", "answer": "The air-entry tension, ψ, is significant because it represents the pressure head at the top of the tension-saturated zone and is equal to the height of capillary rise. It varies with soil type, ranging from about 10 mm for gravel to 1.5 m for silt and several meters for clay. This variation affects the extent and behavior of the tension-saturated zone, influencing how water moves into and out of this zone."}, {"question": "How do surface evaporation and plant transpiration affect the tension-saturated zone?", "answer": "Surface evaporation and plant transpiration induce head gradients that cause water to move upward from the tension-saturated zone. This upward movement is part of the water balance in the zone, where water is withdrawn to supply plant transpiration or is lost through evaporation, influencing the zone's dynamics and the overall groundwater flow."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrostatic pressure distribution, what characterizes the pressure in the tension-saturated zone?", "answer": "Despite water being under tension (p(z′) < 0), the pressure distribution in the tension-saturated zone remains hydrostatic. This means that the pressure at any point in the zone is determined by the weight of the water column above it, similar to saturated conditions, but with the added effect of capillary forces maintaining saturation near the water table."}, {"question": "Why is the capillary fringe important in understanding groundwater recharge?", "answer": "The capillary fringe, or tension-saturated zone, is crucial for understanding groundwater recharge because it acts as a buffer zone where water from the surface infiltrates and moves downward to recharge the groundwater. The characteristics of this zone, such as its thickness and the air-entry tension, influence the rate and amount of recharge, making it a key component in hydrological studies."}, {"question": "How does the soil type affect the behavior of the tension-saturated zone?", "answer": "The soil type significantly affects the behavior of the tension-saturated zone, primarily through its influence on the air-entry tension, ψ. Different soils have varying capillary rise heights, with finer soils like clay having higher ψ values (and thus thicker tension-saturated zones) compared to coarser soils like gravel. This variation impacts the zone's response to water input and output, affecting groundwater recharge and flow dynamics."}, {"question": "In the context of water movement, what is the role of head gradients in the tension-saturated zone?", "answer": "Head gradients play a critical role in the tension-saturated zone by driving the movement of water. These gradients, induced by surface evaporation, water withdrawal by roots, or other factors, cause water to move upward or downward, influencing the water balance within the zone and the overall groundwater flow. The direction and magnitude of these gradients determine the direction of water movement, either toward the surface or deeper into the groundwater system."}, {"question": "How does the tension-saturated zone contribute to the understanding of vadose zone hydrology?", "answer": "The tension-saturated zone contributes significantly to the understanding of vadose zone hydrology by highlighting the complex interactions between water, soil, and atmospheric conditions.

Pedologists identify soil horizons on the basis of color,  texture,  and  structure  and  designate  them  by letters, as shown in figure 2.47. Not all horizons are present in all soils, and the boundaries between lay- ers are commonly gradational. The relative develop- ment of these horizons is the basis for identifying soil orders  (table  2.14)  and  for  more  detailed  pedologic classification.  The  development  of  pedologic  hori- zons  is  determined  largely  by  climate,  but  depends also  on:  (1)  local  topography;  (2)  the  effects  of  ero- sion, deposition, and other disturbances; (3) the type of parent material; and (4) the time over which soil- forming processes have been operating. The develop- ment  of  these  horizons  may  vary  significantly  over short  distances  depending  on  local  conditions,  but does not vary temporally over the time scale of most hydrologic analyses. Because of the variability in development of pedo- logic and hydrologic horizons, only a few generaliza- tions can be made about the relations between them. In  non-wetland  soils,  the  root  zone  usually  occupies the zone of eluviation and may extend throughout the solum. Ordinarily the zones of eluviation and illuvia- tion  develop  only  in  the  unsaturated  zone  above  the capillary  fringe,  but  in  some  soils  the  seasonal  high water  table  may  move  into  the  solum.  Large  water- conducting  pores  called  macropores,  produced  by roots and animal activity, may occur in the root zone. Bluish,  grayish,  and  greenish  mottling  of  sub- soils, called gleying, usually indicates reduced aera- tion because the horizon is below the water table for a significant fraction of the year. In wetlands, where the water table is at or near the ground surface, the soil may consist almost entirely of organic layers or, where  mineral  soils  are  present,  the  solum  may  be absent or poorly developed. Soil-hydraulic  properties  may  change  relatively abruptly  in  successive  pedologic  horizons.  In  some cases  impermeable  or  nearly  impermeable  layers called hardpan or fragipan develop at or below the B layer,  and  percolating  water  may  accumulate  above these  layers,  forming  a  table  above perched  water the general regional water table. However, other soils show  a  more  or  less  gradual  decrease  in  hydraulic conductivity and porosity with depth (Beven 1984).

However, other soils show a more gradual decrease in hydraulic conductivity and porosity with depth. This variability in soil-hydraulic properties affects water movement, as it can lead to the formation of perched water tables or influence the rate of water infiltration."}, {"question": "Why do bluish, grayish, and greenish mottling of subsoils, known as gleying, indicate reduced aeration in soils?", "answer": "Gleying indicates reduced aeration because it usually occurs in horizons that are below the water table for a significant fraction of the year. This reduced aeration is due to the prolonged saturation of the soil, which limits the availability of oxygen and leads to the formation of these characteristic mottling patterns."}, {"question": "In the context of wetlands, how does the presence of a water table at or near the ground surface affect soil development and properties?", "answer": "In wetlands, the presence of a water table at or near the ground surface can lead to soils that consist almost entirely of organic layers or have a poorly developed solum. This is because the constant saturation of the soil limits the development of distinct pedologic horizons and can result in soils with unique properties, such as high water-holding capacity and low hydraulic conductivity. The soil-hydraulic properties in these environments are often distinct from those in non-wetland soils, requiring special consideration in hydrologic analyses."}, {"question": "How does the depth to the water table influence the equilibrium water-content profile in soils, and what are the implications for soil moisture?", "answer": "A higher water table maintains the overlying soil in a wetter state, as shown in figure 8.8. This means that the equilibrium water-content profile will be higher for soils with a shallower water table. The implications of this are that soils with a higher water table will tend to have higher soil moisture contents, which can affect plant growth, infiltration rates, and other hydrologic processes. This relationship highlights the importance of considering the depth to the water table when modeling or analyzing soil moisture dynamics."}, {"question": "What is the effect of net recharge rate on the climatic-equilibrium water-content profile, and how does it compare to the effect of water table depth?", "answer": "The effect of net recharge rate on the climatic-equilibrium water-content profile is minor, as shown in figure 8.9.

As water enters a dry soil in the first stages of infiltration, the pressure gradient at the surface is much larger than the unit gravitational gradient, and the infiltration rate is almost entirely due to pressure forces and tends to be large. Thus infiltration into un- saturated soils typically occurs at high rates at the be- ginning of the event. As the process continues, near- surface water content increases, causing the pressure- gradient forces and the infiltration rate to decline; if water  input  continues  for  a  long  enough  time,  the pressure forces become small and the infiltration rate declines quasi-exponentially to a near-constant value that approximates the rate due to gravity alone (fig- ure 8.10). Typical vertical profiles of water content during an infiltration event are shown in figure 8.11. The re- gion of rapid downward decrease in water content is called  a  front,  which  in  this  case  was  at  a depth of about 3 cm after 0.83 hr and had progressed to about 33 cm after 83 hr of steady infiltration. Wet- ting fronts in clay soils like that in figure 8.11 tend to be  relatively  diffuse  due  to  the  effect  of  capillarity, but  are  quite  sharp  (i.e.,  quasi-horizontal)  in  sandy soils  (figure  8.12).

This change occurs because as the near-surface water content increases, the pressure-gradient forces decrease, leading to a reduction in the infiltration rate. The decline in pressure forces is a result of the soil becoming less dry and the pressure gradient becoming less significant compared to gravity."}, {"question": "In the context of wetting fronts, what is the effect of capillarity on the shape of the front in different soil types?", "answer": "Capillarity affects the shape of the wetting front, making it relatively diffuse in clay soils but quite sharp (quasi-horizontal) in sandy soils. This difference is due to the varying effects of capillarity on water movement in different soil types, with clay soils having a more pronounced effect that leads to a more gradual change in water content with depth."}, {"question": "Why may the wetting front become unstable and lead to concentrated downward flow in certain conditions?", "answer": "The wetting front may become unstable and lead to concentrated downward flow into vertical \"fingers\" when the hydraulic conductivity increases with depth. This instability occurs because the increased hydraulic conductivity with depth can cause the water to preferentially flow through certain paths, leading to the formation of these fingers."}, {"question": "In the context of infiltration events, what is the role of gravity in determining the long-term infiltration rate?", "answer": "Gravity plays a significant role in determining the long-term infiltration rate, as the infiltration rate declines to a near-constant value that approximates the rate due to gravity alone when the pressure forces become small. This indicates that gravity is the dominant force driving infiltration in the long term, once the initial pressure-driven flow has decreased."}, {"question": "How do the initial stages of infiltration into dry soil differ from the later stages in terms of the driving forces behind the flow?", "answer": "The initial stages of infiltration are driven primarily by pressure forces, resulting in high infiltration rates. In contrast, the later stages are driven more by gravity, as the pressure gradient forces decrease and the infiltration rate declines to a near-constant value. This transition reflects the changing balance between pressure and gravity as the soil becomes less dry and the pressure gradient becomes less significant."}, {"question": "In the context of soil properties, how does the type of soil affect the shape and progression of the wetting front during an infiltration event?", "answer": "The type of soil significantly affects the shape and progression of the wetting front.

This difference is crucial in understanding how infiltration rates and patterns vary across different soil types and how these variations impact hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the wetting front becoming unstable and forming \"fingers\" for water movement and infiltration in soils?", "answer": "The formation of \"fingers\" due to the instability of the wetting front has significant implications for water movement and infiltration. It can lead to preferential flow paths, where water moves more quickly through certain areas of the soil, potentially bypassing other regions. This phenomenon can affect the overall infiltration rate, soil moisture distribution, and the transport of solutes and contaminants, highlighting the complexity of infiltration processes in heterogeneous soils."}, {"question": "How does the progression of the wetting front relate to the increase in near-surface water content during an infiltration event?", "answer": "As the infiltration event progresses, the near-surface water content increases, causing the pressure-gradient forces to decrease.

The progression of the wetting front, which is the region of rapid downward decrease in water content, reflects this change, as it moves downward into the soil profile over time, indicating the advancing front of infiltrating water."}, {"question": "In the context of infiltration dynamics, what factors influence the rate at which the wetting front moves downward into the soil?", "answer": "The rate at which the wetting front moves downward into the soil is influenced by factors such as the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, the pressure gradient, and the effect of capillarity. These factors interact to determine the infiltration rate and the shape of the wetting front, with changes in these factors over time and with depth affecting the progression of the infiltration event.

Root  growth  and  de- cay and the action of worms, soil insects, and bur- rowing  mammals  contribute  to  the  surface porosity.  This  effect  occurs  also  in  grass  (Hino  et al.  1987)  and  even  in  arid  scrubland,  where  infil- tration  was  found  to  be  nearly  three  times  higher under individual bushes than in the open (Lyford and  Qashu  1969).  In  deciduous  broad-leaved  for- ests, the leaf litter can produce a “shingling” effect that can have the opposite result and prevent infil- tration, at least locally. Frost:  If  surface  soil  with  a  high  water  content freezes, “concrete frost” can form, making the sur- face nearly impermeable. However, frost action as- sociated with lower water contents can sometimes markedly  increase  the  surface  permeability (Schumm  and  Lusby  1963;  Dingman  1975).  In some  permafrost  areas,  seasonal  freezing  at  the surface  produces  a  polygonal  network  of  cracks that can admit much of the spring melt water. Swelling-drying:  Some  soils,  especially  Vertisols (section  2.3.1),  contain  clay  minerals  that  swell when  wet  and  shrink  when  dry.  During  the  rainy season,  or  during  a single  rain  storm,  swelling  can reduce  effective  surface  porosity  and  permeability and limit infiltration; during dry periods polygonal cracks develop that can accept high infiltration rates. Rain compaction: The impact of rain on bare soils causes  the  surface  to  compact,  producing  a  soil seal  that  markedly  decreases  infiltration.  The  in- tensity of the effect is determined by the kinetic en- ergy  of  the  rain  modified  by  the  physical  and chemical  nature  of  the  soil  (Assouline  and Mualem 1997). sediment:  Where  surface  ero- Inwashing  of  fine sion occurs due to flow over the surface, or where mineral grains are brought into suspension by the splashing of  raindrops,  fine  sediment  may  be  car- ried  into  larger  pores  and  effectively  reduce  the surface  pore  size  and  permeability.

The increased porosity is also contributed by root growth and decay, as well as the action of worms, soil insects, and burrowing mammals."}, {"question": "Why can frost have different effects on the surface permeability of soils?", "answer": "Frost can have different effects on the surface permeability of soils because its impact depends on the water content of the soil. If the surface soil has a high water content and freezes, it can form \"concrete frost\" that makes the surface nearly impermeable. However, if the water content is lower, frost action can sometimes increase the surface permeability.

{"paragraph": "8.2.3.3 Water Content of Surface Pores Saturation  from  below  occurs  when  local  re- charge  and/or  ground-water  flow  from  upslope causes the local water table to rise to the surface.

Either situation may reduce or prevent perco- lation  at  depth,  which  in  turn  causes  an  accumula- tion  of  water  arriving  from  above  and  may  lead  to creation of a saturated zone. If water input continues at a high enough rate, the saturated zone can reach the surface and prevent further infiltration regardless of  the  hydraulic  conductivity,  the  rate  of  input,  or any other factor.

However, a soil that is relatively wet at the beginning of a water-input event will be more likely to become saturated during the event, resulting in a longer period of reduced infiltration.

This highlights the importance of understanding the vertical variability in soil properties for predicting infiltration and groundwater recharge."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to predict the net effect of antecedent water content on infiltration without considering specific site conditions?", "answer": "Predicting the net effect of antecedent water content on infiltration is challenging because it depends on several factors, including the water-input rate and duration, the distribution of soil-hydraulic conductivity with depth, the depth of the local water table, and the initial water content itself. These factors can vary significantly from one site to another, making it essential to consider the specific conditions of each site to accurately evaluate the impact of antecedent water content on infiltration. The complexity of these interactions necessitates the development of models, like the one mentioned in section 8.4.3, to quantitatively assess these factors."}, {"question": "How does the initial water content of the soil influence its likelihood of becoming saturated during a water-input event?", "answer": "The initial water content of the soil significantly influences its likelihood of becoming saturated during a water-input event. A soil that is relatively wet at the beginning of the event is more likely to become saturated, as it has less capacity to absorb additional water. This increased likelihood of saturation can lead to a longer period of reduced infiltration, affecting the overall hydrological response of the soil to the water-input event."}, {"question": "In what scenarios can surface saturation occur, and what are the consequences for infiltration and groundwater recharge?", "answer": "Surface saturation can occur when the local water table rises to the surface due to local recharge and/or groundwater flow from upslope, or when a saturated zone forms and reaches the surface due to continued high water input. The consequences of surface saturation include the prevention of further infiltration, regardless of hydraulic conductivity or input rate, leading to runoff and potentially affecting groundwater recharge.

Conversely, rougher surfaces impede the flow, leading to slower overland flow rates."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between surface slope, roughness, and infiltration rates once ponding has begun and overland flow starts?", "answer": "Once ponding begins and overland flow starts, steeper slopes and smoother surfaces promote more rapid overland flow, which in turn leads to less accumulation of ponded water on the surface. This results in lower infiltration rates because more water is being quickly transported away from the surface as overland flow, rather than infiltrating into the soil."}, {"question": "How does the hydraulic resistance of the surface influence the onset of overland flow?", "answer": "The hydraulic resistance of the surface plays a crucial role in the onset of overland flow. Once ponding begins, the ponding depth increases until it is sufficient to overcome the hydraulic resistance of the surface. At this point, downslope runoff or overland flow begins, indicating that the hydraulic resistance acts as a threshold that must be surpassed for overland flow to initiate."}, {"question": "In the context of water balance, why do smoother surfaces and steeper slopes lead to lower infiltration rates?", "answer": "Smoother surfaces and steeper slopes lead to lower infiltration rates because they facilitate more rapid overland flow once ponding has begun. This rapid overland flow results in less water being available for infiltration into the soil, as more of it is quickly transported away from the surface. This highlights the importance of surface characteristics in determining the balance between infiltration and runoff in hydrological processes."}, {"question": "What implications does the relationship between surface slope, roughness, and infiltration have for understanding hydrological processes?", "answer": "The relationship between surface slope, roughness, and infiltration has significant implications for understanding hydrological processes. It underscores the complex interplay between surface characteristics, infiltration, and overland flow. For instance, in areas with steep slopes and smooth surfaces, the potential for rapid overland flow and consequent lower infiltration rates must be considered in hydrological modeling and water resource management.

{"paragraph": "8.3.1 Ring Infiltrometers A  infiltrometer  is  a  device  for  direct  field measurement of infiltration over a small area (0.02–1 m2). The area is defined by an impermeable bound- ary, usually a cylindrical ring extending several centi- meters above the surface, and sealed at the surface or extending several centimeters into the soil. A  condition  of  ponding  due  to  saturation  from above is created within the ring by direct flooding of the surface or by applying a sufficiently high rate of simulated rainfall. The rate of infiltration is obtained by: (1) measuring the rate at which the level of pon- ded water decreases; (2) measuring the rate at which water has to be added to maintain a constant level of Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils ponding; or (3) solving a water-balance equation for the ponded surface: where f (t) is the average infiltration rate over the pe- riod  of  measurement,  W  is  the  volume  of  water applied  in  Q  is  the  volume  of  ponded  water  re- moved from the plot (usually by a small pump) dur- ing Δt, ΔH is the change in ponded-water level during Δt, and A is the area covered by the infiltrometer. As  noted,  infiltration  rates  during  the  early stages of the process are usually high, and gradually decrease to a nearly constant value; it is this constant value  that  is  usually  taken  as  the  infiltrability  at  a particular location. We will see later that this rate is approximately equal to the saturated hydraulic con- ductivity of the near-surface soil. Because  water  infiltrating  into  an  unsaturated soil  is  influenced  by  both  capillary  (pressure)  and gravity forces, the water applied within an infiltrom- eter ring moves laterally as well as vertically (figure 8.13) and the measured infiltration rate thus exceeds the rate that would be obtained if the entire surface were  ponded.  One  way  of  reducing  this  effect  is  to use concentric rings (a double-ring infiltrometer) in which  areas  within  both  rings  are  ponded;  the  area between  the  two  rings  acts  as  a  “buffer  zone”  and measurements on the inner ring only are used to cal- culate the infiltration rate (figure 8.14). Swartzendr- uber  and  Olson  (1961a,  1961b)  suggested  that  the inner-  and  outer-ring  diameters  be  at  least  100  and 120 cm, respectively. A  more convenient approach  is to use  a  single- ring infiltrometer and apply a correction for the cap- illary effect; Tricker (1978) showed that this gave sat- isfactory  results  using  a  single  ring  of  15-cm diameter  and  correction  factors  that  depend  on  the measured rate and the duration of the measurement.

{"paragraph": "8.4.2 Solutions to the Richards Equation The  Richards  equation  [equation  (8.16)]  is  the basic  theoretical  equation  for  infiltration  into  a  ho- mogeneous porous medium. Because it is nonlinear, Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils there is no closed-form analytical solution except for highly simplified ψ–θ and K –θ relations and bound- ary conditions. However, as noted in section 7.4.7, the Richards equation can be used as a basis for numerical model- ing of infiltration, exfiltration, and redistribution by specifying  appropriate  boundary  and  initial  condi- tions, dividing the soil into thin layers, and applying the equation to each layer sequentially at small incre- ments of time. Tests have shown good agreement be- tween  the  predictions  of  the  numerically  solved Richards equation and field and laboratory measure- ments  (Nielsen  et  al.  1961;  Whisler  and  Bouwer 1970). Šimůnek and van Genuchten (2009) described a flexible numerical model for solving  the  Richards equation in a variety of applications. Numerical solutions, however, are not very use- ful for providing a conceptual overview of the ways in  which  various  factors  influence  infiltration,  and they are generally too computationally intensive for inclusion  in  operational  hydrologic  models.  Thus there  have  been  many  attempts  to  develop  approxi- mate  analytical  solutions  to  the  Richards  equation that can be applied to specific situations such as infil- tration  (Wang  and  Dooge  1994).  The  first  and  best known  of  these  was  developed  by  Philip  (1957, 1969), who formulated an infinite-series solution for ponded infiltration into an indefinitely deep soil with a uniform initial water content: –1 2 1 2 f t A A t where S  is the soil sorptivity (box 8.2, figure 8.16). As  noted  in  box  8.2,  the  first  term  of  (8.19)  comes from an analytical solution to the Richards equation that applies to the early stages of infiltration when the process  is  controlled  almost  exclusively  by  the  pres- sure gradient. Inclusion of subsequent terms extends the applicability to longer durations, but usually only the first two terms are used. A  has the dimensions of a hydraulic conductivity [L T–1] and is designated K so that the Philip equation is usually written as The cumulative infiltration F(t) is given by the time- integral of equation (8.20a): · t1/2 + K F(t) = S  · t. Part III: Water Movement on the Land Box 8.2 Approach to Analytical Solutions of the Richards Equation: Diffusivity, Sorptivity, and the Boltzmann Transformation Diffusivity In some situations, problems of soil-water movement can be more readily solved by defining the hydraulic diffusivity, D (θ), as (q) (q)◊ Note that D (θ) has appropriate dimensions of a diffusiv- write Darcy’s law for vertical unsaturated flow [equation (7.26)] as z’ x h h (q) (q)◊ - (8B2.2) Using (8B2.1), diffusivity can be expressed as an ana- lytical function of soil properties and water content using the relations in table 7.2. For example, using the Brooks–Corey relations, · θ* b+2; thus diffusivity increases with water content for a given soil, and increases as soil-grain size increases (figure 8.15). Sorptivity As noted in section 8.2.2, in the earliest stages of ver- tical infiltration into dry soils, the pressure forces are much greater than the gravity forces. The soil sorptivity, S , is a measure of the rate at which water will be drawn into an unsaturated soil in the absence of gravity forces (equivalent to horizontal infiltration), and is a function of the initial water content, porosity, hydraulic conductiv- ity, and air-entry tension. Sorptivity arises in formulating analytical solutions for infiltration based on the Richards equation, as described below. Note that the dimensions 7.2), it can be related to soil properties and the initial soil wetness prior to infiltration, θ , as p 0 h ae (Rawls et al. 1992). Figure 8.16 shows S  for sand, loam, and clay soils as a function of initial soil dryness (f ). Horizontal Infiltration Figure 8.17 on p. 364 shows an experimental setup for measuring horizontal infiltration. The Richards equa- tion [equation (8.16)] for this situation can be written as ∂x ∂x ∂t where x is the horizontal coordinate. This can be written using (8B2.1) as ∂ ∂q˘ ∂q D . (8B2.6) ∂x ∂x ∂t For horizontal infiltration, the conditions for application of (8B2.5) are t = 0, θ = θ  at x > 0; x = 0, θ = θ  at t ≥ 0. The upper graph in figure 8.17 is a schematic plot of data (θ versus x at successive times t , t , t ) obtained with the experimental apparatus shown. The Boltzmann Transform Boltzmann (1894) formulated a mathematical trans- form for solving diffusion problems that combines the space and time variables into a single variable Φ: Φ ≡ x · t –1/2. This transform allows θ to be expressed as a function of a single variable Φ rather than of both x and t, so that (8B2.5) can be written as an ordinary, rather than a par- tial, differential equation: dF dF 2 dF Because of the definition of Φ, the transform is only appropriate when the boundary conditions for x = 0 are the same as for t → ∞, and vice versa. This is true in the present case, and the new boundary conditions are θ = θ  for Φ → ∞, θ = θ  for Φ = 0. Now the data can be replotted as a single curve of θ ver- sus Φ, as shown in the lower graph of figure 8.17. Analytical Solution for Horizontal Infiltration Following Brutsaert (1992), note that the cumulative volume of infiltrated water, F, is Dingman 08.fm  Page 363  Tuesday, November 11, 2014  10:09 AM Substituting the Boltzmann variable [equation (8B2.7)], this becomes Since the integral in (8B2.9) has constant limits, it has a constant value in a given situation, which in fact is the formal definition of the sorptivity (Philip 1957), i.e., Combining (8B2.9) and (8B2.10) gives a relation for total horizontal infiltration as a function of time: F(t) = S Figure 8.15 Diffusivity, D , of typical sand, loam, and clay soils as a function of degree of saturation, θ* Figure 8.16 Sorptivity, S , of typical sand, loam, and clay soils as a function  of  initial Chapter 8 Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils and taking the derivative of this gives an expression for the rate of infiltration as a function of time, f (t): (8B2.13) (8B2.10) These results for horizontal infiltration are applicable to the early stages of vertical infiltration, when the gravi- tational force is negligible relative to the pressure force that results from the strong contrast in water contents at and near the surface. As discussed in section 8.4.2, addi- (8B2.11) tional terms must be added to equations (8B2.11) and (8B2.12) to capture later stages of the process.

Part III: Water Movement on the Land Note  that  equation  (8.20a)  reproduces  the  gen- eral behavior apparent in figure 8.10: Infiltration rate decreases  with  time  and  becomes  asymptotic  to  a constant  value.  However,  Swartzendruber  (1997) showed that equation (8.20) is the exact solution of the  Richards  equation  only  when  is  a  linear function of θ and the level of ponded water increases in proportion to t1/2, which are generally unrealistic conditions.  Philips’s  approach  has  three  additional limitations: (1) since it applies only to ponded condi- tions,  it  is  not  directly  applicable  to  flux-controlled infiltration  [equation  (8.13)],  a  common  situation discussed  further  below;  (2)  equations  (8.19)  and (8.20a) give an infinite initial infiltration rate [ verges as t increases beyond a certain time and thus ceases to portray the actual behavior. In  spite  of  these  theoretical  limitations,  the Philip equation has been widely used. It can be ap- plied  to  modeling  flux-controlled  infiltration  after the  time  of  ponding  by  applying  a  time-adjustment approach.  To  do  this,  a  time,  ,  is compression found by solving equation (8.20a) for the time when the infiltration rate equals the water-input rate, w: Figure 8.17 Experimental set-up for measuring horizontal infiltration.

Chapter 8 Box 8.3 Least-Squares Estimates of Parameters of the Philip Equation The Least-Squares Method Field or laboratory experiments are often conducted to determine the values of parameters that appear in a theoretical equation that characterize a particular pro- cess. In such situations, one wants to find the values of the parameters that will give the “best fit” of the equa- tion to the data. “Best fit” is usually interpreted to mean the parame- ter values that minimize the sum of the squared differ- ences between the measured values and the values predicted by the theoretical equation. This is called the least-squares criterion, and it is represented mathe- matically as minimize (SS), (8B3.1) x  is the ith measured value of the process of interest, is the ith value of the process according to the theoreti- cal equation, and N is the number of measured values. Application to Determining Parameters of the Philip Equation To determine the values of   and   that provide the best fit of the Philip equation [equation (8.20b)] for a particular soil, we measure the cumulative infiltration at successive times using an infiltrometer under ponded case equation (8B3.2) becomes Sˆ ◊t1 2 where F(t ) are the cumulative infiltration amounts mea- sured at N successive times t .

The values of   and   that minimize SS are found by taking the derivative of equation (8B3.4) with respect to each of the parameters, setting the results equal to zero, and solving for the parameters.

They are more suited for specific, detailed predictions rather than for understanding the broader, conceptual aspects of infiltration and water movement in soils."}, {"question": "How does the concept of sorptivity relate to the infiltration process, and what factors influence its value?", "answer": "Sorptivity (S) is a measure of the rate at which water is drawn into an unsaturated soil in the absence of gravity forces, reflecting the soil's ability to absorb water. It is influenced by the initial water content, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and air-entry tension of the soil. Sorptivity plays a crucial role in formulating analytical solutions for infiltration, such as the Philip equation, and its value can be determined experimentally or estimated from soil properties."}, {"question": "In the context of applying the Philip equation to flux-controlled infiltration, what adjustments are necessary, and why?", "answer": "To apply the Philip equation to flux-controlled infiltration, a time-adjustment approach is used. This involves finding the time of ponding and then using an effective time that accounts for the period before ponding occurs. This adjustment is necessary because the Philip equation was originally derived for ponded conditions, and flux-controlled infiltration does not meet these conditions until after the soil surface becomes saturated."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the limitations of analytical solutions like the Philip equation for practical applications in hydrology, and how are these limitations addressed?", "answer": "The limitations of analytical solutions, such as the Philip equation, include their restricted applicability to specific conditions (e.g., ponded infiltration) and their simplifying assumptions (e.g., linear relationships between hydraulic properties and water content). These limitations can be addressed through the development of more complex numerical models that can handle a wider range of conditions and nonlinear relationships. Additionally, empirical parameters derived from field and laboratory measurements can be used to improve the accuracy of these models for specific applications. However, the trade-off between model complexity and computational feasibility must be carefully considered to ensure that the models remain useful for practical hydrologic predictions and decision-making."}, {"question": "How do the least-squares method and experimental data contribute to determining the parameters of the Philip equation, such as S and K?", "answer": "The least-squares method is used to find the values of S and K that best fit the measured infiltration data. By minimizing the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted cumulative infiltration values, the method provides estimates for these parameters. Experimental data from infiltrometers are crucial for this process, as they provide the necessary measurements of cumulative infiltration over time. These data are then used in equations derived from the least-squares criterion to solve for S and K, allowing for the application of the Philip equation to specific soils and conditions."}]}

This condition sets the stage for the infiltration process, as the introduction of water at the surface at time t = 0 creates a gradient that drives the movement of water into the soil.

Thus  the  infiltration rate decreases with time (as in figure 8.10 and 8.21b) because  the  gradient  producing  the  pressure  force (capillary  suction)  decreases  with  time  as  the  wet- ′(t) increases. ting-front depth z Since  H(t)  is  in  general  a  complicated  function that depends on the amount of infiltration up to time t and the surface slope and roughness, and since sat- isfactory  results  for  many  natural  situations  have been obtained by assuming H(t) is negligible (as will be shown later), our subsequent analysis will assume H(t) = 0. Then noting that ′(t) and substitute it we can solve this expression for z into equation (8.32) to yield = ◊ + £ £ which  is  the  Green-and-Ampt  equation  for  infiltra- bility after ponding occurs. Equation  (8.34)  gives  the  infiltration  rate  as  a function of the total infiltration that has occurred af- ter  the  time  of  ponding.  For  this  to  be  useful,  we need a relation between f (t) or F(t) and t, and we can derive such a relation if we recognize that With  equation  (8.35),  we  see  that  equation (8.34) is a differential equation that can be solved to yield  a  relation  for  t  as  a  function  of  F(t)  after  the time of ponding: Chapter 8 Ampt model states that If the water-input rate is greater than or equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity (w ≥ K ), ponding occurs. As input continues the infiltration rate f (t) gradually declines, becoming asymptotic to K . Thus  the  Green-and-Ampt  model  predicts  the same behavior given by the approximate solutions to the  Richards  equation  in  equation  (8.20)  and  ob- served  in  nature.  Unfortunately,  however,  equation (8.36)  cannot  be  inverted  to  give  F(t)  as  an  explicit function of t, which would be more convenient. Thus application  of  equation  (8.36)  requires  arbitrarily choosing values of F(t) and solving for t. If the cho- or t > T , it is invalid. sen value of F(t) gives t < T The corresponding infiltration rate f (t) is then found by substituting valid values of F(t) in equation (8.34), and the corresponding depth of wetting front, z can be computed from equation (8.33).

This raises the water content and the hydraulic conductivity. However, the water content cannot exceed its value at saturation, and the hydraulic conductivity cannot increase beyond its saturation value."}, {"question": "How does the infiltration rate change over time when the water-input rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and why does this change occur?", "answer": "The infiltration rate decreases with time because the gradient producing the pressure force (capillary suction) decreases with time as the wetting front depth increases. This happens as the surface layer reaches saturation, and the excess water accumulates on the surface as ponding. The decrease in infiltration rate is a result of the balance between the pressure force and the gravity force, with the pressure force decreasing as the wetting front descends, while the gravity force remains constant."}, {"question": "In the scenario where the water-input rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity, why does ponding occur, and what is the significance of the time of ponding (T)?", "answer": "Ponding occurs because the water-input rate exceeds the saturated hydraulic conductivity, causing the surface layer to become saturated. The time of ponding (T) is significant because it marks the instant when the surface layer becomes saturated, and all the rain that has fallen up to this point has infiltrated. The time of ponding is crucial in determining the infiltration rate and the depth of the wetting front after ponding occurs."}, {"question": "What is the Green-and-Ampt equation for infiltrability after ponding occurs, and how does it relate to the infiltration rate and the total infiltration that has occurred after the time of ponding?", "answer": "The Green-and-Ampt equation for infiltrability after ponding occurs is given by equation (8.34), which expresses the infiltration rate as a function of the total infiltration that has occurred after the time of ponding. This equation is derived by assuming that the depth of ponding (H(t)) is negligible and by applying Darcy's law in finite-difference form between the surface and the depth of the wetting front. The equation shows that the infiltration rate decreases with time as the total infiltration increases, and it provides a useful tool for predicting the infiltration rate and the depth of the wetting front after ponding occurs."}, {"question": "In the context of the Green-and-Ampt model, how does the infiltration rate change as input continues after the time of ponding, and what are the implications of this change for the infiltration process?", "answer": "According to the Green-and-Ampt model, as input continues after the time of ponding, the infiltration rate gradually declines, becoming asymptotic to the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K). This change implies that the infiltration process becomes less efficient over time, with the infiltration rate approaching a steady-state value. The model also predicts that the infiltration rate will decrease with increasing water deficit, initial soil moisture, and hydraulic conductivity, and will increase with increasing water-input rate."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to apply the Green-and-Ampt equation (8.36) in practice, and what are the limitations of this equation?", "answer": "The Green-and-Ampt equation (8.36) is challenging to apply in practice because it cannot be inverted to give the cumulative infiltration (F(t)) as an explicit function of time (t). This means that the equation requires arbitrarily choosing values of F(t) and solving for t, which can be time-consuming and may not always yield valid results. Additionally, the equation is only valid for t > T, and if the chosen value of F(t) gives t < T, the equation is invalid. These limitations highlight the need for alternative approaches or approximations to the Green-and-Ampt equation."}, {"question": "In the context of infiltration, what is the significance of the wetting front, and how does its depth change over time?", "answer": "The wetting front is a critical concept in infiltration, representing the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones in the soil.

The depth of the wetting front changes over time, increasing as the infiltration continues and the soil becomes more saturated. The wetting front plays a key role in determining the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration, and its depth is an important parameter in models such as the Green-and-Ampt equation."}, {"question": "How does the infiltration rate relate to the hydraulic conductivity and the water-input rate, and what are the implications of this relationship for infiltration modeling?", "answer": "The infiltration rate is closely related to the hydraulic conductivity and the water-input rate.

{"paragraph": "8.4.3.8 Summary The  system  of  equations  (8.26)  through  (8.36) provides a complete model of the infiltration process for cases where w > K  and the other assumptions of the idealized situation apply—most importantly, the representation of the wetting front as an abrupt “pis- ton-like”  discontinuity  and  a  homogeneous  initial water-content profile. Mein and Larson (1973) com- pared  infiltration  predictions  using  this  model  with those derived by numerical solution of the Richards equation,  and  found  the  excellent  correspondence shown in figure 8.24. Thus in spite of its development from idealized conditions, the Green-and-Ampt model captures the essential aspects of the infiltration process, in partic- ular the complete infiltration of rain up to the time of ponding and the quasi-exponential decline of infiltra- tion rate thereafter. This decline is due to the steadily decreasing pressure gradient, ψ ′(t), as the wetting front  descends,  and  is  asymptotic  to  .  Thus  the minimum value of infiltrability for a soil is its satu- rated  hydraulic  conductivity.  A  valuable  feature  of the model is that its parameters are measurable bulk physical properties of the soil that  affect  infiltration in intuitively logical ways. The assumption of a piston-like wetting front is closer to reality for sands than for clays, in which the wetting front tends to be less distinct. The computa- tion of equilibrium water-content profiles (figure 8.7) suggests that the assumption of homogeneous initial water content is better for clays than sands; the pro- file also becomes more homogeneous for deeper wa- ter tables for all soil types (figure 8.8).

{"paragraph": "8.5.1 Spatial and Temporal Variability of Infiltration Detailed field studies generally show a very high degree  of  spatial  variability  of  infiltrability  and  the factors that affect infiltration rates, particularly satu- rated  hydraulic  conductivity.  The  experiments  of Burgy and Luthin (1956) give a striking example of this variability.  They  first  measured the infiltrability of an unvegetated clay soil by flooding a 335-m2 ba- sin  and  measured  the  rate  of  decline  of  the  water level.  After  this  water  had  completely  infiltrated, they  made  ring-infiltrometer  measurements  at  119 sites  evenly  spaced  throughout  the  basin.  The  aver- age  value  for  the  infiltrometer  measurements,  16.8 cm/hr,  was  reasonably  close  to  the  basin  value  of 10.8 cm/hr, but the infiltrometer values ranged from near zero to over 110 cm/hr.

(1980) found an 11-fold and 29-fold variation in the Philip-equation parameters S  and K , respectively,  and  a  7.5-fold  variation  in  total  infiltra- tion for a 30-min storm over a 0.096-km2 watershed in Oklahoma, with no consistent relation between these quantities  and  location  or  soil  type.  In  another  de- tailed study in that same watershed, Loague and Gan- der  (1990)  found  that  the  scale  of  spatial  correlation Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils (defined in section 4.3.2.6) of infiltration was less than 20 m, that there was little spatial structure to the data, and that infiltration rates were strongly influenced by animal activity, vegetation, and climate rather than by soil texture. Buttle and House (1997) found similar re- sults in Ontario, where saturated hydraulic conductiv- ity was largely determined by macropores. In other small-watershed-scale studies in humid areas, Tricker (1981) measured infiltrability (infiltra- tion rates after 1 hr of ponded infiltration) over a 3.6- km2 watershed in England and found values ranging from near zero to 256 cm/hr; these values were posi- tively related to the thickness of the surface organic layer but unrelated to soil texture or soil-water con- 15.7-km2 tent.  Measurements  on  a  watershed  in Northern  Ireland  found  a  considerably  lower  range of  variability  in  infiltrability,  but  a  similar  depen- dence on soil organic matter rather than soil texture (Wilcock  and  Essery  1984).  This  latter  study  also found a substantial seasonal variability, with average infiltrability considerably higher in summer (0.9 cm/ hr in June) than in winter (0.06 cm/hr in January). Springer  and  Gifford  (1980)  repeatedly  mea- sured infiltrability with infiltrometers at 20 to 25 lo- cations  on  a  plowed  and  grazed  rangeland  area  in Idaho  and  found  coefficients  of  spatial  correlation [equation (4.25)] in the range of 0.40 to 0.68 and lit- tle seasonal variation.

If the rainfall rate exceeds the hydraulic conductivity, there is potential for ponding, and the infiltration rate is constant at the rainfall rate until the time of ponding is reached. This method provides a way to assess the likelihood of ponding and its impact on infiltration rates."}, {"question": "Why is the infiltration rate constant at the rainfall rate from t = 0 to t = 0.461 hr in the given scenario?", "answer": "The infiltration rate is constant at the rainfall rate from t = 0 to t = 0.461 hr because the rainfall rate exceeds the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, leading to potential ponding. During this period, the soil's ability to absorb water is exceeded by the rainfall rate, resulting in a constant infiltration rate equal to the rainfall rate. This constant rate continues until the time of ponding is reached, after which the infiltration rate may change."}, {"question": "In the context of the Philip equation, how does the initial water content of the soil affect infiltration-rate calculations?", "answer": "Although the paragraph does not directly discuss the Philip equation's handling of initial water content, it implies that the initial water content (θ) is an important factor in infiltration-rate calculations. The initial water content affects the soil's hydraulic properties and, consequently, its infiltration capacity. However, the specific relationship between initial water content and infiltration rate in the Philip equation is not detailed in the provided text."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the soil being classified as hydraulic class B3 in the given example?", "answer": "The soil being classified as hydraulic class B3 indicates its hydraulic properties, such as infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity. This classification, based on the soil's composition (20% sand, 60% silt, and 20% clay), allows for the determination of specific hydraulic parameters, like f = 0.413 and K, which are crucial for infiltration-rate calculations using methods like the Green-and-Ampt implicit and explicit approaches."}, {"question": "How do the Green-and-Ampt implicit and explicit methods compare in terms of handling infiltration-rate calculations?", "answer": "The Green-and-Ampt implicit and explicit methods are both used for infiltration-rate calculations but differ in their approach. The implicit method is used when the rainfall rate exceeds the hydraulic conductivity, potentially leading to ponding, and it computes the time of ponding. In contrast, the explicit method does not require the computation of ponding time and can be used for scenarios where ponding is not a concern. The choice between these methods depends on the specific conditions of the infiltration event, such as the rainfall rate and soil properties."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the time of ponding in infiltration-rate calculations?", "answer": "Considering the time of ponding is crucial because it affects the infiltration rate and the overall water balance. When the rainfall rate exceeds the soil's infiltration capacity, ponding occurs, and the infiltration rate becomes constant at the rainfall rate until the ponding time is reached. After this point, the infiltration rate may decrease as the soil becomes saturated. Accurately predicting the time of ponding and its impact on infiltration rates is essential for understanding and modeling water movement in soils."}, {"question": "In the context of the given example, what are the implications of the soil composition on infiltration-rate calculations?", "answer": "The soil composition, with 20% sand, 60% silt, and 20% clay, classified as a silt loam, has significant implications for infiltration-rate calculations. This composition determines the soil's hydraulic properties, such as its infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity, which are critical parameters in methods like the Green-and-Ampt implicit and explicit approaches. The specific values of these parameters, such as f = 0.413 and K, derived from the soil composition, directly influence the calculated infiltration rates and the potential for ponding. Understanding the relationship between soil composition and hydraulic properties is essential for accurate infiltration-rate predictions."}, {"question": "How does the initial water content of the soil influence the infiltration capacity in the context of the Green-and-Ampt implicit method?", "answer": "The initial water content of the soil (θ) is a critical factor in determining the infiltration capacity in the Green-and-Ampt implicit method. Although the exact relationship is not detailed in the provided text, the initial water content affects the soil's hydraulic properties, which in turn influence the infiltration rate calculations. A higher initial water content would generally reduce the infiltration capacity,"}]}

This approach is  problematical  for  infiltration  because,  as  we  have just  seen,  soil  properties  and  initial  conditions  are highly  variable  spatially  and  temporally,  and  suffi- cient measurements to characterize this variability are usually  unavailable.  Furthermore,  infiltration  rates are  nonlinearly  related  to  soil  properties  [equations ter values does not provide meaningful areal-average values of infiltration rate. Even more fundamentally, recall that Darcy’s law and the Richards equation, on which  the  Philip  and  Green-Ampt  approaches  are based, were derived for representative elemental volumes, i.e., at scales many orders of magnitude smaller than of practical hydrologic interest, and it is not clear to what extent these relations can be scaled up. Thus, as Kabat et al. (1997, p. 369) concluded, An area-average solution for [the Darcy–Richards] equation, which would retain the physical meaning of the soil hydraulic characteristics (i.e. soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves), remains compu- tationally laborious, non-trivial and in many cases an almost impossible task, requiring an extended knowledge of local-scale information. However, Kabat et al. (1997) also concluded that models  using  a  physics-based  structure  are  “too  at- Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils Green-Ampt explicit Green-Ampt 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 1.80 2.00 Time (hr) tractive to be discarded” and can be applied to large areas if the parameters that represent hydraulic con- ductivity, porosity, etc., are treated as calibration pa- rameters  that  do  not  necessarily  have  a  direct relation to field-measurable quantities. These param- eters can be determined on the basis of geometric scal- ing or dynamic scaling. Geometric scaling is based on the concept that two soils that are geometrically similar are related by a scale factor α, where where λ  and λ are the characteristic lengths (grain sizes) of a soil at a given location x and a reference soil,  respectively.  Then  other  properties  are  related as powers of this scale factor that depend on their di- mensional character; for example, = α0 · θ = α–1 · ψ = α2 · K = α1/2 · S These  equations  imply  that  the  soil-water-retention and hydraulic-conductivity characteristics at a given water content at any location can be related to mean (reference)  moisture-characteristic  and  hydraulic- Part III: Water Movement on the Land characteristic  curves.  In  theory,  the  values  calcu- lated for all properties should be identical. Dynamic scaling is based on writing the govern- ing  equation  in  dimensionless  form,  using  dimen- sionless time and depth variables. For example, after defining a dimensionless cumulative infiltration, b(t ) (t ), and a dimensionless time, the Philip equation [equation (8.20b)] can be written as β(t) = τ1/2 + τ. Sharma  et  al.  (1980)  tested  the  applicability  of geometric and dynamic scaling. They found that in- filtrometer measurements at 26 sites on a small wa- tershed were well fit by the Philip equation [equation (8.20)],  but  that  the  variation  in  parameters  was large: S  varied by one order of magnitude and K  by two orders of magnitude (figure 8.26a), and neither was  related  to  soil  type  or  topographic  position.  In spite of this, the combined data from all 26 infiltrom- eters  was  well  fit  by  equation  (8.57)  (figure  8.26b), suggesting that dynamic scaling is valid. However, using reference soil properties defined as the averages of the values at the 26 sites,   and , the α values calculated from measured and   values differed, suggesting that strict geo- metrical  scaling  was  violated.  This  difference  is likely due to spatial differences in initial water con- tent, which affects S  [equation (8B2.4)] but not K . The  correspondence  between  the  values  was greatly  improved  when  the  harmonic  or  geometric, rather than arithmetic, mean was used to define S , and Sharma et al. (1980) concluded that the concept of geometrical scaling should be investigated further. Kabat  et  al.  (1997)  also  found  support  for  dy- namic scaling based on the Richards equation. They found  that  soils  with  similar  hydrologic  response have  similar  values  of  the  characteristic  response time δ, where Examination of field data showed that the reference curve  determined  by  scaling  closely  approaches  the “effective”  area-average  curve  that  reproduces  the hydrologic behavior, and that characteristic values of δ can be associated with soil-texture classes. A  recent  study  by  Jana  and  Mohanty  (2012) used a hydrologic model based on the Richards equa- tion  to  compare  four  techniques  for  up-scaling  soil- hydraulic parameters from a 30-m to a 1-km resolu- tion. They found that a topographically based scaling algorithm captured much of the variation in soil-hy- draulic parameters at the larger scale and was gener- ally successful at reproducing hydrologic behavior at that  scale.

Therefore, developing models that can effectively incorporate and account for this variability remains a significant research and application challenge in hydrology."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of representative elemental volume important in the context of Darcy's law and the Richards equation?", "answer": "The concept of representative elemental volume (REV) is crucial because Darcy's law and the Richards equation were derived for conditions at the scale of the REV, which is much smaller than the scales typically of interest in hydrologic applications. The REV is the smallest volume over which the properties of the porous medium can be considered homogeneous, and scaling these equations up to larger, more heterogeneous areas poses significant challenges.

The harmonic or geometric mean may provide a better representation, especially for properties like sorptivity, which is affected by initial water content. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting the appropriate method for averaging and scaling soil properties to ensure that the scaled values accurately represent the behavior of the system."}, {"question": "How does the choice of scaling method impact the accuracy of infiltration modeling, and what are the implications for hydrologic applications?", "answer": "The choice of scaling method, whether geometric or dynamic, significantly impacts the accuracy of infiltration modeling.

In  the  second  pattern,  a  “bulge”  in  water  con- tent  develops  due  to  rapid  gravitational  drainage soon after infiltration ceases and persists as redistri- bution  progresses.  A  sharp  wetting  front  is  main- tained, but the water contents above the bulge form a gradual “drying front” that is transitional to the field capacity.  This  situation  occurs  when  the  gravita- tional  force  is  significant  (i.e.,  the  water  content above  the  initial  wetting  front  exceeds  the  field  ca- pacity),  and  hence  characterizes  coarser-grained soils and higher F(T ). In this case the rate of redis- tribution increases with greater F(T ), and in the “fi- nal”  condition  the  infiltrated  water  is  distributed over a depth z Once this “final” state is reached, there will be slow redistribution by pressure forces at the wetting front. Biswas  et  al.  (1966)  showed  several  examples  of  re- distribution in the absence of a water table in labora- tory experiments. In the absence of evapotranspiration, the equilib- rium  profile  (figures  8.7–8.9),  rather  than  a  uniform water content, more realistically approximates the an- tecedent  conditions  encountered  by  an  infiltration event. If infiltration ceased when the wetting front was Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils at one of the levels shown in figure 8.23, subsequent redistribution  due  to  gravity  and  pressure  gradients would cause the profile to “rotate” counterclockwise toward the equilibrium curve. Using numerical solutions to the Richards equa- tion, Rubin (1967) showed that hysteresis has a signifi- cant effect on soil-water profiles during redistribution. Interestingly,  he  found  that  profiles  accounting  for hysteresis were not intermediate between those using nonhysteretic wetting and nonhysteretic drying mois- ture-characteristic curves (figure 8.30). 8.6.2. Redistribution with Evapotranspiration In  many  natural  situations,  extraction  of  water from  the  upper  soil  layers  by  evapotranspiration strongly  affects  water  redistribution  following  infil- tration. This process is  governed by  and  can be nu- merically modeled via the Richards equation, adding a “sink” term to represent uptake of water by plants in the root zone: where S is the rate of uptake per unit volume ([L3 T–1/ into  a  number  of  layers  (generally  on  the  order  of  a few  centimeters  thick)  and  the  equations  are  solved for  successive  time  steps  (generally  on  the  order  of Part III: Water Movement on the Land minutes to hours) (e.g., Rubin 1967; Milly 1988; Mu- siake et al. 1988). However, numerical solutions of (8.61) are com- putationally expensive, and sufficient data to capture the  variability  in  soil  properties  in  a  watershed  are seldom available. Thus for many purposes, the drain- age from a soil layer can be satisfactorily modeled us- ing  a  simpler  approach  based  on  an  approximation of Darcy’s law in which the capillary gradient is ig- Figure 8.30 Numerically simulated water-content profiles 2 hr after cessation of rain on a sandy soil.

For example, Black et al. (1970) used equation (8.24) in a simple water-balance  pro- cedure applied to a soil layer supporting a vegetable crop.  In  their  application,  the  change  in  water  con- tent of the soil layer over time period t,  , was cal- culated as - q Dt - - where ET  and F  are the evapotranspiration and to- tal infiltration during period t, respectively, Δt is the time step, and Δz is the thickness of the layer. The av- erage  soil-water  content  at  the  end  of  period  t,  , was then found as q = q + Dq . Black et al. (1970) found that water contents esti- mated in this way compared well with measured val- ues even with Δt = 1 day and Δz = 150 cm. However, this  approach  can  become  numerically  unstable  un- , so it may be necessary to make Δt less  Dq << q < 1 day. With this modification, equations (8.62) and (8.63) appear to be sound bases for simulating perco- lation in general hydrologic models (see also Groves 1989), although the problem of adequately account- ing for the variability of soil properties remains. When  evapotranspiration  occurs  following  an infiltration  event,  an  upward-decreasing  water-con- tent  gradient  is  produced  similar  to  that  of  figure 8.29b. Figure  8.31 shows  total  head  (water-content) changes following infiltration in a forest soil; most of the water loss in this case was due to evapotranspira- tion rather than to gravitational drainage, as in figure 8.29b.

{"paragraph": "8.7 Summary Infiltration and soil-water movement are critical hydrologic  processes  since  they  determine  the  rates and amounts of water available for surface and sub- surface  runoff,  evapotranspiration,  and  recharge  to ground water. These processes are also crucial in de- termining water quality (see Nielsen et al. 1986 for a review  of  solute  transport  in  the  vadose  zone).  In Chapter 8 Figure 8.31 Daily profiles of total head changes due largely to evapotranspiration from a forest soil during a rainless period. The soil-water tension, which reflects the water content, is the horizontal distance between each profile and the gravitational head line [reproduced from Musiake et al.

Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils Part III: Water Movement on the Land fact,  it  has  been  said  that  “hydrology  is  mostly  soil physics” (Youngs 1988). The classical theory of unsaturated flow based on Darcy’s law and the Richards equation is well devel- oped  and  tested,  and  has  been  successfully  incorpo- rated in hydrologic models in various forms. Some of these models employ approximate analytical solutions or  numerical  approximations  of  the  basic  equations, while others use simpler but physically based represen- tations  like  the  Green-Ampt  and  Philip  approaches. However, we need to be aware that the classical theory may  inadequately  represent  soil-water  processes  in many situations. This is especially true where macro- pores are important routes of water and solute trans- port  and  where  soil-water  movement  is  affected  by temperature gradients and freezing and thawing. The  quantitative  characterizations  of  equilib- rium  soil-water  profiles  developed  by  Salvucci  and are  important  contributions  to  understanding  how soil-water  conditions  are  affected  by  climate,  soil type,  and  water-table  depth,  and  appear  to  be  very useful for large-scale water-balance modeling and for rainfall-runoff  modeling  (discussed  further  in  chap- ter 10). The most critical theoretical and practical ques- tions in the application of theory concern the repre- sentation  of  the  typically  wide  variability  in  the conditions  that  determine  infiltration.  Because  of our limited understanding of this variability and the paucity of field data, we are often led to highly sim- plified model representations of the process. Promis- ing approaches in this area include the application of various statistical methods (e.g., Berndtsson and Lar- son  1987)  and  scaling  and  similarity  theory  (e.g., Sharma  et  al.  1980;  Wood  et  al.  1990;  Kabat  et  al. 1997; Jana and Mohanty 2012). There is a continu- ing  need  for  field  data  so  that  we  can  understand what  we  are  attempting  to  model,  and  the  remote sensing of soil moisture and other surface factors will be essential in this regard.

The water table is the fluctu- ating  upper  boundary  of  the  ground-water  zone  at which pressure is atmospheric (denoted on diagrams by the hydrat symbol,  ). Figure 9.1 shows the gen- eral relations between ground water and surface wa- ter.  Most  water  enters  the  ground-water  reservoir when  infiltrated  water  arrives  at  the  table  as recharge;  recharge  can  also  occur  by  horizontal  or vertical  seepage  from  surface-water  bodies.  Under natural  conditions  ground  water  eventually  dis- charges  into  rivers  or  lakes  or,  in  coastal  areas,  di- rectly into the ocean; water can also leave the ground- water reservoir by moving upward from the water ta- ble into the capillary fringe and thence into the unsat- urated zone, where it is subject to evapotranspiration. Ground  water  constitutes  about  30%  of  the world’s total fresh water and 99% of its total stock of liquid fresh water (table 2.5). As with all hydrologic stocks,  ground  water  is  in  continual  motion,  albeit slow (typically much less than 1 m/d). Using the val- ues from figure 2.20 in equation (1.25), one can cal- culate  that  the  overall  residence  time  for  the  global ground-water reservoir is about 235 yr; for moderate- Ground Water in the Hydrologic Cycle to large-scale regional flow systems in various parts of the world residence time varies from a few years to  1,000  years  or  more.  In  spite  of  its  slow  pace, ground water is a crucial link in the hydrologic cycle because it is the source of most of the water in rivers and lakes. Ground water is, of course, also important as the direct source of water withdrawn for domestic water use, irrigation, and industrial uses worldwide. In the United States, about one-fourth of the water used for these  purposes  comes  from  ground  water,  and  the proportion is much higher for many regions; concern about  the  quantity  and  quality  of  ground  water  is one of the major water-resource issues in many parts of the world. The  material  properties  of  porous  media  were described in sections 7.1 and 7.2, and the basic phys- ics  of  ground-water  flow  were  developed  in  section 7.3.  For  convenience,  the  basic  equations  and  con- cepts  of  ground-water  flow  are  summarized  in  box 9.1 on p. 391. Our focus in this chapter is on ground water as a link in the hydrologic cycle. We will examine the ef- fects of topography and geology on natural ground- water flows in drainage basins; how ground water in- Part III: Water Movement on the Land Figure 9.1 Unconfined and confined aquifers in a region of folded sedimentary rocks.

We will also briefly examine the hydraulics of wells, how human  use  of  ground  water  affects  the  basin  water balance, and the concept of “safe yield.” We do not explore the chemical evolution of ground water or its relation  to  geotechnical  problems  or  geologic  pro- cesses;  these  topics  are  well  covered  in  many  texts devoted  exclusively  to  hydrogeology  (e.g.,  Freeze and Cherry 1979; Fetter 2001).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of hydrologic processes, what role do infiltration and soil-water movement play in determining water availability?", "answer": "Infiltration and soil-water movement are critical hydrologic processes that determine the rates and amounts of water available for surface and sub-surface runoff, evapotranspiration, and recharge to groundwater.

This distinction highlights the multifaceted nature of aquifers and their importance in various aspects of hydrology."}, {"question": "What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes an aquitard from an aquifer?", "answer": "The primary characteristic that distinguishes an aquitard from an aquifer is its inability to transmit water at hydrologically significant rates. Aquitards are formations that do not allow water to move through them quickly enough to contribute significantly to groundwater flow or supply, setting them apart from aquifers which are defined by their capacity for significant water storage and transmission."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, why is it important to consider the potential-energy field of an aquifer?", "answer": "Considering the potential-energy field of an aquifer is important in the context of groundwater flow because it helps in understanding the flow field induced within the aquifer. The potential-energy field drives the movement of groundwater, and recognizing its role allows hydrologists to predict how water will move within an aquifer, which is crucial for managing groundwater resources and understanding hydrological processes."}, {"question": "How do the properties of a formation influence its classification as an aquifer, aquitard, or aquiclude?", "answer": "The properties of a formation, particularly its lithology and permeability, influence its classification as an aquifer, aquitard, or aquiclude. Formations with high permeability and the ability to store and transmit significant amounts of water are classified as aquifers. Those with lower permeability that cannot transmit water at significant rates are considered aquitards, and the term aquiclude, although less commonly used due to the recognition of few truly impermeable materials, would theoretically apply to formations with extremely low permeability. The classification is critical for hydrological studies and water resource management, as it determines the role of the formation in the groundwater system."}, {"question": "Why is the term aquiclude less frequently used in modern hydrology?", "answer": "The term aquiclude is less frequently used in modern hydrology because it is now recognized that few, if any, geologic materials are strictly impermeable. This understanding has led to a shift away from categorizing formations as completely impermeable, instead acknowledging a spectrum of permeabilities among different geologic materials. This nuanced view is more accurate and useful for hydrological modeling and water resource assessment."}]}

(9B1.2) Total head at a point in a saturated porous medium is measured as the elevation of the water surface in a piezometer, which is a tube connecting the point to the atmosphere (see figure 7.8). Gravitational head at the point is measured as the elevation of the point above an arbitrary datum. Pres- sure head at the point can be determined as ψ = h – z.

Grain diameters of geologic materials range over more than six orders of magnitude (< 10–6 m to > 1 m); at near-surface conditions, viscosity varies approxi- mately twofold as a function of temperature, and water density is essentially constant. Thus K  of granular geologic materials varies over 12 orders of magnitude (figure 7.9).

For unconfined aquifers, the upper boundary is a water surface at atmospheric pressure, known as the water table. In contrast, confined aquifers are bounded above and below by formations with significantly lower hydraulic conductivity, resulting in pressures greater than atmospheric throughout."}, {"question": "How does recharge occur in unconfined versus confined aquifers?", "answer": "Recharge to unconfined aquifers typically occurs from infiltrated water percolating vertically to the water table over a significant portion of the upper surface. In contrast, major recharge to confined aquifers occurs from water infiltrating at its \"upstream\" end, where the flow is not confined and a water table is present. This difference in recharge mechanisms reflects the distinct hydrological characteristics of each aquifer type."}, {"question": "Why do flow and storage in unconfined aquifers correlate, whereas they do not in confined aquifers?", "answer": "Flow and storage in unconfined aquifers are correlated because the elevation of the water table changes as the flow through the aquifer varies. This correlation is similar to that observed in streams. In contrast, the boundary of the flow in a confined aquifer does not change with time, leading to a lack of correlation between flow and storage, akin to flow in pipes. This fundamental difference in behavior has significant implications for the management and modeling of these aquifer systems."}, {"question": "In the context of hydraulic conductivity, how do the properties of the medium and the fluid influence its value?", "answer": "Hydraulic conductivity is determined by properties of both the medium and the fluid. The intrinsic permeability of the medium, which depends on grain shape, size distribution, and packing, is a key factor. Additionally, the fluid's mass density, gravitational acceleration, and dynamic viscosity also influence hydraulic conductivity. As a result, hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude in granular geologic materials, depending on factors such as grain diameter and temperature."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the potentiometric surface in confined aquifers?", "answer": "The potentiometric surface is an imaginary surface in confined aquifers that represents the level to which water would rise in an observation well penetrating the aquifer. It is analogous to the water table in unconfined aquifers. The potentiometric surface is a useful concept for understanding the pressure distribution and flow behavior in confined aquifers, as it indicates the level at which the water is under pressure greater than atmospheric."}, {"question": "How do the characteristics of unconfined and confined aquifers impact their management and modeling?", "answer": "The distinct characteristics of unconfined and confined aquifers have significant implications for their management and modeling. Unconfined aquifers, with their correlated flow and storage, require consideration of the dynamic interaction between the water table and the aquifer. In contrast, confined aquifers, with their lack of correlation between flow and storage, can be managed and modeled more similarly to pipes. However, the three-dimensional spatial variability of geologic conditions can produce flows that exhibit characteristics of both types, adding complexity to their management and modeling. Furthermore, the potential for leaky aquitards to transmit significant amounts of groundwater must also be considered, as this can impact the overall hydrological behavior of the system."}, {"question": "In the context of ground-water flow, what is the role of Darcy's Law?", "answer": "Darcy's Law states that the ground-water flow rate in a given direction is equal to the product of the local total head gradient and the local hydraulic conductivity of the medium in that direction. This law is valid for laminar (viscous) flow and is a fundamental principle for understanding and modeling ground-water flow. Darcy's Law provides a basis for predicting flow rates and pressures in aquifers, which is essential for managing groundwater resources effectively."}, {"question": "Why is it important to recognize the idealized nature of the unconfined/confined categories?", "answer": "Recognizing the idealized nature of the unconfined/confined categories is important because real-world aquifers often exhibit characteristics of both types due to the three-dimensional spatial variability of geologic conditions. This complexity can lead to flows that do not fit neatly into one category, and understanding these nuances is crucial for accurate modeling and management of groundwater systems. Additionally, acknowledging the potential for leaky aquitards to transmit significant amounts of groundwater highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to groundwater management that considers the interconnectedness of different aquifer systems."}, {"question": "How does the specific storage of an aquifer relate to its ability to store water?", "answer": "Specific storage is defined as the volume of water entering or leaving a control volume per unit increase or decrease in head, divided by the control volume.

In this case, the decrease of stor- age  accompanying  the  head  decrease  is  due  to:  (1) compaction of the aquifer as part of the weight of the overlying  material  is  transferred  from  the  liquid  to the solid grains, resulting in an increase in effective stress  and  a  slight  decrease  in  porosity  and  (2)  ex- pansion  of  the  water  due  to  the  lowered  pressure (box 9.2 on p. 395). The changes are reversed for an increase in head. Following  Freeze  and  Cherry  (1979),  when  a volume    of  a  saturated  aquifer  is  subjected  to  an increase in effective stress dσ , it is compacted by an amount –dV , and an equal volume of water dV  is expelled. Thus from equations (9B2.5) and (9B2.6), dV  = –dV w T T eff T where α [L2 F–1] is the aquifer compressibility and γ [F L–3] is the weight density of water. Thus for a unit the volume of water expelled becomes = α · γ. The  increase  in  effective  stress  produces  a  de- crease in fluid pressure and head [equations (9B2.3) and  (9B2.4)],  which  produces  an  expansion  in  the water. From equation (9B2.1), this is given by = –β · V dV  · dp. The total volume of water in the unit volume of medium  is  ·  ,  where  is  porosity.  Thus  using equation (9B2.4), equation (9.7) becomes dV = b f g. Thus the specific storage for a confined aquifer is the sum  of  the  water-volume  changes  due  to  compac- tion/expansion  of  the  medium  [equation  (9.6)]  and of the water [equation (9.8)]: = + f g. The  dimensionless  storage  coefficient,  S,  for  a  con- fined aquifer is often called the storativity; combin- ing equations (9.2) and (9.9) gives = + f g .

If the pressure is increased by an amount dp, the volume will decrease by an amount –dV . The compressibility of water, β, is defined as the relative decrease in volume per unit increase in pressure [L2 F–1]: This is a reversible process, so a decrease in pressure (dp < 0) causes a concomitant expansion (dV  > 0). β for water is very small and is effectively constant at near-sur- face pressures and temperatures at β = 4.4×10–10 m2/N. Effective Stress Consider a horizontal plane within a saturated porous medium. The total stress (≡ force per unit area [F L–2]) acting on the plane is due to the weight of the overlying mineral medium and water. Part of this stress is borne by the solid particles of the medium and part by the fluid, which is reflected in the fluid pressure. Thus = p + σ , (9B2.2) where σ  is total stress, p is fluid pressure, and σ  is the stress borne by the medium, which is called the effec- tive stress. In most hydrologic situations, the weight of the over- lying rock and water do not change, so that dσ  = 0 and dσ  = –dp. (9B2.3) Thus if pressure decreases, stress is transferred from the fluid to the medium, and effective stress increases. This increase causes the grains of the medium to become somewhat more densely packed, so the medium com- pacts. If pressure increases, the effective stress decreases, and the medium tends to expand. However, the process is not quantitatively reversible, and the expansion is less than the compaction in response to a given dp. This means that a medium tends to become increasingly compacted in response to repeated cycles of increasing and decreasing pressure changes.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of confined aquifers, how does a decrease in head affect the aquifer and the water within it?", "answer": "A decrease in head in a confined aquifer results in a lowering of the piezometric surface.

Additionally, the water within the aquifer expands due to the lowered pressure. These changes are reversible, with the opposite effects occurring when the head increases."}, {"question": "Why does the specific storage for a confined aquifer include both the compaction/expansion of the medium and the expansion of the water?", "answer": "The specific storage for a confined aquifer includes both components because the decrease in head leads to two distinct responses: the compaction of the aquifer medium due to increased effective stress and the expansion of the water due to decreased pressure. The compaction of the medium results in a decrease in porosity, while the expansion of the water is a direct response to the pressure change.

The significant difference between these two hydrologic properties highlights the distinct behaviors of confined versus unconfined aquifers in response to changes in head or pressure."}, {"question": "How does the concept of effective stress influence the compressibility of water and aquifers in hydrologic situations?", "answer": "Effective stress plays a crucial role in the compressibility of both water and aquifers. In most hydrologic situations, the weight of the overlying rock and water remains constant, leading to a direct relationship between changes in fluid pressure and effective stress (dσ = –dp). This relationship means that a decrease in pressure results in an increase in effective stress, causing the aquifer medium to compact. Conversely, an increase in pressure decreases the effective stress, allowing the medium to expand, albeit not to the same extent as it compacted. This process is fundamental to understanding the dynamic behavior of aquifers under varying hydrologic conditions."}, {"question": "Why is the compressibility of water, β, considered a constant in hydrologic calculations, and what are the implications of this assumption?", "answer": "The compressibility of water, β, is considered a constant (β = 4.4×10–10 m2/N) because it is very small and effectively constant at near-surface pressures and temperatures. This assumption simplifies hydrologic calculations by allowing the use of a fixed value for β. However, it implies that the model may not fully capture the behavior of water under extreme pressure or temperature conditions, potentially affecting the accuracy of predictions in certain scenarios."}, {"question": "In the context of aquifer behavior, what is the difference between specific yield and storativity, and how do these concepts relate to confined and unconfined aquifers?", "answer": "Specific yield refers to the volume of water that an aquifer releases from storage per unit decline in hydraulic head, per unit area of the aquifer. Storativity, on the other hand, is a dimensionless quantity that represents the volume of water released from storage in an aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head, per unit area of the aquifer, and is often used to describe confined aquifers. The key difference lies in their application to confined versus unconfined aquifers, with specific yield being more relevant to unconfined aquifers and storativity to confined aquifers. Understanding these concepts is crucial for predicting and managing groundwater resources."}, {"question": "How does the process of compaction and expansion in aquifers respond to repeated cycles of increasing and decreasing pressure changes, and what are the implications for aquifer behavior?", "answer": "The process of compaction and expansion in aquifers is not quantitatively reversible. When pressure decreases, the effective stress increases, causing the aquifer to compact. Conversely, when pressure increases, the effective stress decreases, and the aquifer expands, but to a lesser extent than it compacted. This means that with repeated cycles of pressure changes, the aquifer tends to become increasingly compacted. The implications of this behavior include potential long-term changes in aquifer properties, such as reduced porosity and permeability, which can affect groundwater flow and storage. This non-reversible compaction can have significant implications for the long-term management and sustainability of groundwater resources."}]}

{"paragraph": "9.1.5 Aquifer Response Time and Residence Time Unconfined aquifers are reservoirs in which out- flow is related to storage [equation (1.23)], and stor- age  is  related  to  inflow  and  outflow.  A  relative measure  of  the  time  scale  at  which  aquifer  storage and outflow vary is given by where τ is aquifer response time [T], L is a measure of  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  aquifer  [L],  and  the other symbols are as defined earlier. The inverse of τ is often called the aquifer response rate (Erskine and Papaioannou  1997).  These  response  characteristics appear in various contexts later in this chapter. As  noted,  the  S  values,  and  hence  response times,  for  unconfined  aquifers  are  orders  of  magni- tude greater than those for confined aquifers, because changes in storage in unconfined aquifers reflect the Chapter 9 actual filling and emptying of soil pores rather than the very minor effects of water and aquifer compress- ibility. Unconfined aquifers may also be subject to re- charge  by  infiltration  and  water  loss  in  response  to evapotranspiration over their entire extents. Thus Unconfined aquifers are much more interactively related to the regional hydrologic cycle than are confined aquifers, and unconfined aquifers will be the sole focus of sub- sequent ground-water treatments in this text.

A  boundary  streamline flows  vertically  downward  at  the  divides,  horizon- tally along the impermeable base, and vertically up- ward under the streams.

In  figure  9.7b,  on  the other  hand,  each  hill  in  the  water  table  produces  a small-scale recharge-discharge system that circulates above  a  larger-scale  flow  in  the  left  half  of  the  sys- tem,  and  both  these  systems  circulate  above  a  still larger-scale flow system extending from the major di- vide to the major valley. Patterns like that in figure 9.7b led Tóth (1963) to  conclude  that,  in  many  situations,  one  can  iden- tify local flow systems, in which water moves from a recharge area to the next adjacent discharge area; re- systems,  in  which  the  flow  is  from  the gional  flow recharge  area  farthest  from  the  main  valley  to  the discharge area in the main valley; and intermediate flow systems, in which the flow path is longer than local but shorter than regional (figure 9.8 on p. 401).

However,  the pattern  of  development  of  flow  systems  of  various scales is affected also by the overall system geometry: Development  of  local  flow  systems  is  favored  where the depth to the impermeable layer is small relative to Part III: Water Movement on the Land the  distance  from  the  main  valley  to  the  divide,  and the  more  pronounced  the  relief,  the  deeper  the  local systems  extend;  regional  systems  are  favored  where the impermeable layer is deep relative to that distance. (These relations are examined further in section 9.2.5.) Thus, as noted by Freeze and Cherry (1979), to- pography  alone  can  create  complex  ground-water flow patterns. In general, uplands are recharge areas and  lowlands  are  discharge  areas;  hinge  lines  are usually closer to the valleys than to the divides and discharge areas typically constitute less than 30% of a given drainage basin.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of groundwater flow in hilly humid areas, what is the relationship between surface divides, streams, and groundwater flow systems?", "answer": "Surface divides and streams are usually the boundaries of groundwater flow systems, with the balance between net vertical recharge and lateral groundwater flow producing a water table that is a subdued replica of the ground surface."}, {"question": "How does the ratio of recharge rate to hydraulic conductivity affect the water table's replication of topography in hilly humid areas?", "answer": "The higher the ratio of recharge rate to hydraulic conductivity, the more closely the water table replicates the topography, indicating a direct relationship between these factors and the water table's shape."}, {"question": "In the context of arid regions or areas with asymmetric topography or heterogeneous geology, why may groundwater divides not coincide with surface-water divides and bodies?", "answer": "Groundwater divides may not coincide with surface-water divides and bodies in arid regions or areas with asymmetric topography or heterogeneous geology because these conditions can disrupt the typical flow patterns and boundaries seen in more uniform or humid environments. This discrepancy highlights the importance of considering local geological and hydrological conditions when assessing groundwater flow systems. The complexity introduced by these factors can lead to more intricate flow patterns, making it challenging to predict groundwater behavior without detailed knowledge of the area's specific characteristics."}, {"question": "What is the effect of topography on the development of local, intermediate, and regional flow systems in groundwater?", "answer": "Topography plays a significant role in the development of these flow systems. Regions with little local relief typically have only regional systems, while regions with pronounced local relief typically have only local systems. The development of local flow systems is favored where the depth to the impermeable layer is small relative to the distance from the main valley to the divide, and the more pronounced the relief, the deeper the local systems extend. Conversely, regional systems are favored where the impermeable layer is deep relative to that distance. This relationship underscores the complex interplay between topography, geology, and groundwater flow, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of these interactions to accurately predict and manage groundwater resources."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow patterns, how do uplands and lowlands typically function in terms of recharge and discharge?", "answer": "Uplands are typically recharge areas, while lowlands are discharge areas. This general pattern is influenced by the topography, with hinge lines usually closer to the valleys than to the divides. Discharge areas typically constitute less than 30% of a given drainage basin, indicating that the majority of the area is involved in recharge or other parts of the groundwater flow cycle. Understanding this distribution is crucial for managing groundwater resources effectively, as it helps in identifying areas of high recharge potential and areas where discharge might impact surface water bodies or ecosystems."}, {"question": "Why can topography alone create complex groundwater flow patterns, according to Freeze and Cherry (1979)?", "answer": "Topography alone can create complex groundwater flow patterns because it influences the distribution of recharge and discharge areas, the depth to the impermeable layer, and the overall geometry of the groundwater flow system. These factors can interact in complex ways, leading to the development of local, intermediate, and regional flow systems. The complexity arises from the variability in topography, which can cause groundwater flow paths to diverge, converge, or change direction in response to changes in the water table's slope and the underlying geology. This complexity highlights the challenges in predicting groundwater flow and the importance of considering topographic factors in hydrological analyses."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow systems, what role does the depth to the impermeable layer play in the development of local and regional systems?", "answer": "The depth to the impermeable layer plays a crucial role in the development of local and regional groundwater flow systems. For local systems, a smaller depth to the impermeable layer relative to the distance from the main valley to the divide favors their development, allowing for more pronounced local relief to influence groundwater flow. In contrast, regional systems are favored when the impermeable layer is deep relative to this distance, indicating a more extensive and deeper flow system. This relationship suggests that the geometry of the groundwater flow system, influenced by the depth to the impermeable layer, is a key factor in determining the scale and complexity of groundwater flow patterns."}, {"question": "How do the patterns of development of flow systems of various scales affect the overall understanding of groundwater flow?", "answer": "The patterns of development of flow systems of various scales significantly affect the overall understanding of groundwater flow by highlighting the complexity and variability of groundwater systems. These patterns, influenced by topography, geology, and the depth to the impermeable layer, demonstrate that groundwater flow is not uniform but rather consists of interconnected systems operating at different scales. This understanding is essential for accurately predicting groundwater behavior, managing groundwater resources, and assessing the potential impacts of human activities or climate change on groundwater flow systems. It also underscores"}]}

{"paragraph": "9.2.5.1 Hydrologic Landscapes Winter (2001) introduced the concept of hydro- landscape  as  a  framework  for  synthesis  and analysis of the interactions between topography, ge- ology, and climate. This concept is based on the idea that  a  simple  landform—an  upland  adjacent  to  a lowland  separated  by  an  intervening  steeper  slope (figure  9.14  on p. 406)—along  with  its  geology  and climate, is the basic building block of all hydrologic landscapes.  Winter  (2001)  called  this  feature  a damental hydrologic landscape unit (FHLU). The central hydrologic feature of an FHLU is a simple ground-water flow cell from the upland to the lowland,  involving  the  movement  of  water  between the  atmosphere  (precipitation  and  evapotranspira- tion), surface water (controlled by the slopes and per- meability  of  the  unit’s  surfaces),  and  ground  water (controlled  by  the  hydraulic  characteristics  of  the unit’s geologic framework).

Figure 9.15 shows six general FHLU types that occur commonly in various parts of the world. In all these systems • The water table is a subdued replica of the topog- raphy; and • Downward  components  of  ground-water  flow  oc- cur at downward breaks-in-slope of the water table, and upward components at upward breaks-in-slope. In  some  settings,  this  may  result  in  wetlands  in  the area of lower slope; wetlands may also occur where the water table intersects the lower part of the steeper land-surface slope.

Equation  (9B4.9)  gives  significant  insight  into the  water-balance  relations  between  ground-water and  surface-water  flows:  It  shows  that  average ground-water discharge to streams depends only on the average rate of recharge from infiltration, which is essentially climatically determined, and the stream spacing.  The  hydraulic  conductivity  determines  the configuration of the water table required to transmit the  recharge  to  streams  [equation  (9B4.5)],  but  not the flow rate. Note that q  in equation (9B4.9) is the ground- water  contribution  to  streamflow per  unit  length  of stream from one-half of the drainage basin above the cross section. Thus for a drainage basin, Ground Water in the Hydrologic Cycle Figure 9.19 Flood-control effect of bank storage.

This allows for the development of useful approximate analytical solutions to many unconfined flow problems."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to characterize flow in unconfined aquifers without the Dupuit approximation?", "answer": "Characterizing flow in unconfined aquifers is inherently difficult because the position of the upper flow boundary, the water table, changes with time. This dynamic nature of the water table makes it complex to model and predict flow behavior without simplifying assumptions like those introduced by the Dupuit approximation."}, {"question": "In the context of the Dupuit equation for time-varying flow, what is the significance of the equation ∂2h/∂x2 + ∂2h/∂y2 = R/S?", "answer": "The equation ∂2h/∂x2 + ∂2h/∂y2 = R/S represents the Dupuit equation for time-varying flow in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer.

This provides a method to evaluate recharge, which is essentially climatically determined and a critical component of the water balance between groundwater and surface water flows."}, {"question": "In the context of bank storage, how does the process affect flood peaks and the hydrograph?", "answer": "Bank storage affects flood peaks by reducing their magnitude and delaying their timing. As shown in figure 9.19, the solid line represents the hydrograph with bank storage, which peaks later and at a lower magnitude than the dashed line representing the hypothetical flood wave without bank storage. This indicates that bank storage can mitigate the impact of flooding by temporarily storing water in the banks and releasing it later, thus altering the flood hydrograph."}, {"question": "Why is the Dupuit approximation useful for developing analytical solutions to unconfined flow problems?", "answer": "The Dupuit approximation is useful because it introduces simplifying assumptions that do not significantly alter the flow behavior for water-table slopes less than 0.18. This allows for the derivation of equations like the Dupuit equation, which can be applied to various scenarios, such as steady-state aquifer drainage to streams, providing valuable insights into groundwater flow dynamics and water balance relations."}, {"question": "How does the water table configuration change in response to variations in recharge rate and stream elevations?", "answer": "The water table configuration, as described by equation (9B4.5), changes in response to variations in the recharge rate (R) and stream elevations (h1 and h2). An increase in recharge rate or a change in stream elevations would result in a change in the curvature of the water table. This dynamic relationship highlights the importance of considering both recharge and boundary conditions (like stream elevations) when analyzing groundwater flow and aquifer behavior."}, {"question": "What are the implications of the Dupuit approximation for understanding groundwater contribution to streamflow?", "answer": "The Dupuit approximation has significant implications for understanding groundwater contribution to streamflow. It shows that the average groundwater discharge to streams depends only on the average rate of recharge from infiltration and the stream spacing, not on the hydraulic conductivity. This insight is crucial for managing water resources, as it suggests that efforts to enhance groundwater recharge could directly impact streamflow, and thus, the water balance between groundwater and surface water. Additionally, understanding these relationships can inform strategies for sustainable water resource management, especially in regions where groundwater is a primary source of stream"}]}
{"paragraph": "9.3.2 Ground Water and Lakes and Wetlands Lakes  have  the  same  range  of  relations  to ground  water  as  shown  for  streams  in  figure  9.17. Like  gaining  streams,  perennial  lakes  usually  occur in discharge zones, although some are flow-through systems.  Seasonal  lakes  can  be  local  sources  of  re- charge,  like  losing  streams.  In  gaining  and  flow- through situations, the lake surface is at the water-ta- ble elevation. Most fresh-water wetlands are on the borders of streams or lakes, or are former lakes that have been largely or wholly filled with mineral and organic soil and vegetation in various proportions. Thus they are hydrologically  similar  to  lakes,  and  the  discussion here  can  also  be  applied  to  bogs,  swamps,  and marshes. Dooge (1975) and LaBaugh (1986) provide useful  reviews  of  wetland  hydrology  and  Doss ter (1997) describe field investigations. As with regional flow systems, much of our un- derstanding  of  ground-water–lake  interactions  is based on mathematical simulations of idealized situ- ations (McBride and Pfannkuch 1975; Winter 1976, 1978,  1983;  Cheng  and  Anderson  1994),  supple- mented increasingly by field studies (e.g., Crowe and Schwartz  1985;  Cherkauer  and  Zager  1989;  Shaw and Prepas 1990; Winter 1999; Winter et al. 2003). Figure 9.22 shows examples of some of the complex ground-water–lake  interactions  that  can  exist  in  a simple  topographic  setting  as  revealed  by  modeling studies.  In  figure  9.22a  the  subsurface  has  uniform Chapter 9 system disappears and the highest lake receives discharge near its edge and contributes recharge in its center face water bodies are flow-through with respect to ground water [reproduced from Winter et al.

Here  the  lakes  are  in  the  discharge  zones  of  local flow  systems;  there  is  a  regional  flow  system  at depth,  and  an  intermediate  system  that  discharges into the lowest lake. Figure 9.22b shows a situation topographically  identical  to  figure  9.22a,  but  here discontinuous  lenses  of  high  hydraulic  conductivity at depth change the flow net so that the highest lake contributes recharge through its bottom while receiv- Ground Water in the Hydrologic Cycle ing  discharge  around  its  perimeter.  Flow-through lakes tend to occur where water tables do not rise un- der topographic highs (figure 9.22c). Modeling  and  field  studies  have  also  shown that, even where the surrounding geologic materials are  homogeneous,  ground-water  inflow  to  lakes  is concentrated  in  the  littoral  zone  whether  or  not there  are  relatively  impermeable  sediments  present in  the  deeper  part  of  the  lake.  However,  high-con- ductivity  zones  in  the  lake  bed  can  be  loci  of  local Part III: Water Movement on the Land concentration  of  inflows  (springs),  or  zones  of  out- flow  (recharge),  depending  on  the  regional  ground- water  configuration  (Cherkauer  and  Nader  1989; Winter 1999). In  some  situations,  lakes  can  be  recharge  sites exclusively,  at  least  at  certain  seasons.  Meyboom (1966) showed that, in southern Saskatchewan, Can- ada,  spring  snowmelt  runoff  accumulates  in  small depressions  (prairie  potholes)  that  are  above  the  re- charge  zone  of  a  regional  flow  system.  The  subse- quent  leaking  of  these  small  ponds  produces localized  ground-water  mounds  representing  re- charge to this  system. This local ground-water flow pattern reverses in the summer, when trees growing around the edges of the potholes extract ground wa- ter and thereby make the potholes sites of discharge for temporary local flow systems. and Anderson and Cheng (1993) also showed signifi- cant seasonal changes in local ground-water flow sys- tems adjacent to lakes. Winter et al. (2003) reviewed field  studies  of  ground-water–lake  interactions  and noted  that  surface-water  and  ground-water  water- sheds of lakes commonly do not coincide. It is often difficult  to  determine  the  extents  of  subsurface  con- tributing areas because of the lack of detailed subsur- face  information,  the  coexistence  of  ground-water circulations of local to regional scales, and often the effects of seasonal variability on  system boundaries. They  found that  lakes  and  wetlands  in small  water- sheds  at  the  lower  end  of  extensive  ground-water flow  systems  may  receive  subsurface  inflow  from shallow  flow  systems  that  extend  far  beyond  their surface watershed, and may also receive ground-wa- ter inflow from deeper regional flow systems. The above review makes it clear that the hydro- logic setting of lakes and wetlands may be complex and very difficult to determine without detailed sub- surface information, perhaps over an extensive area. This makes it difficult to quantify the most basic hy- drologic  characterization—the  water-balance  equa- tion relating inflows, outflows, and storage changes.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, how do lakes interact with the surrounding groundwater system?", "answer": "Lakes can interact with the surrounding groundwater system in various ways, including as discharge zones where groundwater flows into the lake, or as recharge sites where lake water seeps into the groundwater. The interaction can also be a combination of both, known as flow-through systems, where groundwater flows into the lake in one area and out of it in another. This interaction is influenced by factors such as the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface materials and the slope of the water table."}, {"question": "Why do flow-through lakes tend to occur in certain topographic settings?", "answer": "Flow-through lakes tend to occur where water tables do not rise under topographic highs. This is because the flow of groundwater is influenced by the topography of the area, with groundwater flowing from areas of high elevation to areas of low elevation. In areas where the water table does not rise under topographic highs, the groundwater flow is not restricted, allowing for the formation of flow-through lakes."}, {"question": "In the context of wetland hydrology, what is the significance of high-conductivity zones in the lake bed?", "answer": "High-conductivity zones in the lake bed can be loci of local concentration of inflows (springs) or zones of outflow (recharge), depending on the regional groundwater configuration. These zones can play a crucial role in the hydrologic balance of the lake, as they can either contribute to the lake's water budget or remove water from it. The presence of these zones highlights the complexity of groundwater-lake interactions and the need for detailed subsurface information to understand these interactions."}, {"question": "How do seasonal changes affect the hydrologic setting of lakes and wetlands?", "answer": "Seasonal changes can significantly affect the hydrologic setting of lakes and wetlands. For example, in the summer, trees growing around the edges of prairie potholes can extract groundwater, making the potholes sites of discharge for temporary local flow systems. In contrast, during spring snowmelt, these potholes can accumulate runoff and become recharge sites for the regional flow system. This seasonal variability can make it challenging to determine the extents of subsurface contributing areas and to quantify the water balance of lakes and wetlands."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow systems, why is it often difficult to determine the extents of subsurface contributing areas?", "answer": "It is often difficult to determine the extents of subsurface contributing areas because of the lack of detailed subsurface information, the coexistence of groundwater circulations of local to regional scales, and the effects of seasonal variability on system boundaries. Additionally, the hydrologic setting of lakes and wetlands can be complex, with multiple flow systems interacting and influencing each other.

Furthermore, the complexity of these systems highlights the need for detailed subsurface information and advanced modeling techniques to accurately understand and predict their behavior."}, {"question": "In the context of lake hydrology, how do perennial lakes differ from seasonal lakes in terms of their interaction with groundwater?", "answer": "Perennial lakes usually occur in discharge zones, where groundwater flows into the lake, whereas seasonal lakes can be local sources of recharge, similar to losing streams. This difference in interaction with groundwater is due to the varying water levels and flow regimes of these lakes, with perennial lakes typically having a more stable water level and seasonal lakes experiencing significant changes in water level throughout the year."}, {"question": "Why are surface-water and groundwater watersheds of lakes often not coincident?", "answer": "Surface-water and groundwater watersheds of lakes are often not coincident because the flow of groundwater is influenced by the subsurface geology and topography, which can be different from the surface topography. This can result in groundwater flowing into the lake from areas outside of the surface watershed, or flowing out of the lake into areas outside of the surface watershed. The non-coincidence of surface-water and groundwater watersheds highlights the importance of considering both surface and subsurface flow paths when studying the hydrology of lakes."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater-lake interactions, what is the role of modeling studies in understanding these interactions?", "answer": "Modeling studies play a crucial role in understanding groundwater-lake interactions, as they allow for the simulation of ideal"}]}

{"paragraph": "9.4 Ground Water in the Regional Water Balance In  this  section  we  apply  the  basic  water-balance equation  (section  1.8.1)  to  the  ground  water  of  a  re- gion. The main purposes of the analysis are to (1) de- fine  the  ground-water  balance  components  and  (2) show how the ground-water balance relates to the over- all  regional  water  balance.  Section  9.5  then  describes approaches to quantifying the various components. The surface extent of the control volume for the water-balance equation can be defined arbitrarily—it could  be  a  political  division,  an  aquifer,  or  a  topo- graphically  defined  watershed.  The  lower  boundary of the control volume is usually defined as the “depth at which ground-water flow is negligible”; if the geol- ogy is known, this can be more precisely specified. Choosing  a  watershed  as  a  control  volume  has one  important  advantage:  It  is  usually  possible  to measure at least one of the balance components, sur- face-water outflow (streamflow), accurately. However, researchers studying small watersheds need to be aware that ground water flow divides do not under- lie surface divides in many settings. Only if a surface watershed of a research site is at the highest ridge Chapter 9 Figure 9.23 Definition sketch for deriving the Ghyben–Herzberg relation (box 9.5). The salt-water–fresh-water interface position predicted by this hydrostatic relation differs somewhat from the actual position near the coast due to the dynamics of the flow, which produces an outflow face of width X tion (8B5.8). away from major hydrologic sinks such as regional rivers, can one be sure that ground water is not mov- ing into the area from distant sources. For most other watersheds, ground water can move into watersheds either because ground water divides are not present beneath the surface divides or because ground water moves into the area from deeper flow systems. Ground water divides move in response to changing recharge conditions, which in turn is related to the dynamics of climate and precipitation.

For regional water bal- ances, these errors are likely to result from (1) insuffi- cient  knowledge  of  the  system  boundaries  and  (2) failure to fully account for regional variability. Part III: Water Movement on the Land Box 9.5 The Fresh/Salt Ground-Water Interface in Coastal Aquifers Ghyben–Herzberg Relation Figure 9.23 shows the interface between fresh and salt ground water in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer at a coastline. If we assume that this interface is a static sharp boundary, the hydrostatic pressure on the fresh- water side of the fresh/salt interface, p (x), is f  f f  s where x is distance inland from the coast, γ  is the weight density of fresh water, h (x) is the elevation above sea level of the water table, and z ′(x) is the dis- tance below sea level of the interface. The hydrostatic pressure on the sea-water side of the interface, p (x), is where γ  is the weight density of sea water. N/m3 N/m3 10,045 9,800 i.e., at any distance inland, x, the depth below sea level to the salt/fresh interface is 40 times the height above sea level of the water table. This analysis of the fresh/salt ground-water interface was formulated over 100 years ago, and is known as the Ghyben–Herzberg relation. Todd (1953) used the Ghyben–Herzberg assumptions along with the Dupuit equation (box 9.4) to give the depth to the interface as a function of the ground-water discharge and the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer: z , (9B5.6) where q  is the ground-water discharge to the ocean per unit length of coastline [L2 T–1] and K is hydraulic conductivity. Equating (9B5.3) and (9B5.6) gives relations for the height of the water table as a function of distance from the coast, discharge, and conductivity: Ground-Water Outflow to Ocean Analogously to equation (9.17), q  is the product of the average recharge rate, R [L T–1], and the distance from the ground-water flow divide to the coast, X [L]: q  = R · X. (9B5.8) The Ghyben–Herzberg analysis does not provide for a sub-sea zone in which this discharge must occur. To account for this, Glover (1964) developed a simple model that gives the seaward extent of the outflow face, X ′, as X 20 . (9B5.9) To account for this, an additional term is included in equa- tion (9B5.6) giving the depth to the salt/fresh interface: z , 0 x¢, (9B5.10) where x′ is the distance seaward from the coast. The rela- tive importance of this additional term increases toward the coast, and at the coast (x′ = 0) the interface depth is (9B5.11) Here we use the relations derived above to calculate aspects of the ground-water discharge to the Atlantic Ocean from the southern part of Long Island, New York. The region is underlain by relatively homogeneous glacial sands and gravels about 120 m thick overlying coastal- plain sedimentary rocks, which are relatively imperme- able. The distance from the central ground-water divide to the south coast is about 16 km. The average annual recharge is about 0.57 m/yr, the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is about 50 m/day = 18,250 m/yr. Thus using equation (9B5.8), the discharge to the ocean is q  = 0.57 m/yr × 16,000 m = 9,120 m2/yr per m of coastline. Our analysis will not be valid for points landward of where the fresh/salt interface depth equals the aquifer thickness; to calculate that distance, X*, we rearrange equation (9B5.6) and find the distance corresponding to the aquifer thickness: X * 360 m; 2 40 (9,120 Chapter 9 Table 9B5.1 compares the depths to the interface at increasing distances from the coast computed via equa- Table 9B5.1 Equation (9B5.7) Distance, x  Interface Depth, z ′  Water-Table Height, h 10 20 0.5 20 28 0.7 50 45 1.1 100 63 1.6 200 89 2.2 250 100 2.5 300 110 2.7 360 120 3.0 Figure 9.24 Island Lake area in Nebraska showing surface-water bodies, surface watersheds, contours of the water table (m), and direction of ground-water flow on October 28, 1982.

Long-term average water-balance data are given in table 9B6.1. P estimates were based on data collected at five stations and Q esti- mates on records at five gauging stations. ET was esti- mated based on average monthly temperatures via the Thornthwaite approach (see chapter 6).

In general, this approach  has  severe  limitations,  usually  because  of incomplete  knowledge  of  ground-water  divides. These are probably fairly well known in this case, but even if we also make the assumptions that long-term average  values  of  P,  Q,  and  ET  are  well  known,  we can  at  best  use  equation  (9.20)  to  estimate  (G   – SW GW GW Thus  even  under  ideal  conditions  where  stan- dard network data provides good estimates of P, ET, and  Q,  firm  knowledge  of  a  basin’s  water  balance usually  requires  independently  evaluating  at  least some of the terms in equation (9.21). Approaches to obtaining  quantitative  estimates  of  these  terms  are described in the following section.

This choice is crucial because it influences what is considered as input or output in the balance equation. For instance, choosing a watershed as a control volume allows for the accurate measurement of surface-water outflow, but it may not always coincide with groundwater divides, leading to potential inaccuracies in the analysis."}, {"question": "Why do groundwater divides not always coincide with surface-water divides in small watersheds?", "answer": "Groundwater divides do not always coincide with surface-water divides in small watersheds because groundwater flow can move into the area from distant sources or deeper flow systems, and the groundwater flow divides can shift in response to changing recharge conditions related to climate and precipitation dynamics. This discrepancy can lead to complexities in accurately determining the groundwater balance within a watershed, as it may receive groundwater from outside its surface boundaries or lose groundwater to adjacent areas."}, {"question": "In the context of coastal aquifers, what is the Ghyben-Herzberg relation, and how does it relate to the depth of the fresh/salt interface?", "answer": "The Ghyben-Herzberg relation is an analysis of the fresh/salt groundwater interface in coastal aquifers, which predicts that the depth below sea level to the salt/fresh interface is approximately 40 times the height above sea level of the water table at any distance inland from the coast. This relation provides a simplified model for estimating the position of the interface based on hydrostatic pressures on both the freshwater and saltwater sides of the interface. However, it does not account for the dynamics of flow near the coast, which can affect the actual position of the interface."}, {"question": "How does the width of the outflow face extending seaward from the coast influence the groundwater discharge to the ocean?", "answer": "The width of the outflow face, as given by the Glover model, affects the groundwater discharge to the ocean by providing an additional pathway for groundwater to flow into the ocean. This width can be calculated using the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the average recharge rate, and it is essential for accurately estimating the groundwater discharge. The outflow face's width and the groundwater discharge are interrelated, with the discharge influencing the width and vice versa, highlighting the complexity of groundwater flow in coastal areas."}, {"question": "In the context of regional water balances, why are measurement errors propagated through calculations, leading to large uncertainties in final estimates?", "answer": "Measurement errors in regional water balances are propagated through calculations because the water-balance equation involves the summation and subtraction of various components, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and stream outflow. Small errors in measuring these components can accumulate and lead to significant uncertainties in the final estimates of groundwater inflow or outflow. This issue is exacerbated by insufficient knowledge of system boundaries and the failure to fully account for regional variability, making it challenging to achieve accurate water-balance estimates."}, {"question": "What are the implications of not accounting for the sub-sea zone in the Ghyben-Herzberg analysis for estimating groundwater discharge to the ocean?", "answer": "Not accounting for the sub-sea zone in the Ghyben-Herzberg analysis can lead to inaccuracies in estimating groundwater discharge to the ocean because it neglects the additional pathway for groundwater flow into the ocean provided by this zone. The Glover model addresses this limitation by including the width of the outflow face extending seaward from the coast, which is essential for accurately calculating the groundwater discharge. Ignoring this aspect can result in underestimation of the discharge, highlighting the need for comprehensive models that consider all relevant factors influencing groundwater flow in coastal areas."}, {"question": "How does the choice of control volume affect the estimation of groundwater balance components, such as recharge and discharge?", "answer": "The choice of control volume significantly affects the estimation of groundwater balance components because it determines the boundaries within which these components are measured. For example, choosing a watershed as a control volume may allow for the accurate measurement of surface-water outflow but may not capture groundwater flow into or out of the area accurately. This choice can lead to differences in estimated recharge and discharge rates, emphasizing the importance of carefully selecting the control volume based on the specific goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the study area."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to estimate the groundwater balance in small watersheds, and what are the implications for water resource management?", "answer": "Estimating the groundwater balance in small watersheds is challenging due to the potential for groundwater flow across surface-water divides, the complexity of groundwater flow systems, and the difficulty in accurately measuring all components of the water balance.

{"paragraph": "9.5.1 Recharge from Infiltration, R Infiltrated  water  can  carry  contaminants  from agriculture, industries, and waste-disposal sites to the ground-water  reservoir,  so  quantification  of    has important implications for the study of water quality as well as quantity. As  noted,  the  water-table  configurations  in  the regional  ground-water  flows  depicted  in  figures  9.5 to  9.7  and  9.10  to  9.12  were  specified  as  boundary conditions  to  illustrate  typical  flow  configurations, and these conditions determined the locations of re- charge and discharge zones. Since recharge from in- filtration  is  the  principal  source  of  water  to unconfined  aquifers  and  is  the  ultimate  source  of most  streamflow,  it  is  of  interest  to  explore  further the natural factors that determine the regional distri- bution of recharge and discharge. Direct measurement of recharge requires elabo- rate  instrumentation  and  is  feasible  only  in  a  re- search setting. In one of the few such studies, Wu et al. (1996) installed lysimeters consisting of 60-cm di- ameter  soil-filled  cylinders  in  which  the  water  table was kept at depths ranging from 1.5 to 5 m. At the shallowest  depth  almost  every  water-input  event caused a separate recharge event that was reflected in a rise, peak, and decline of the water table; but at 5 m individual events were not identifiable and there was a  single  annual  peak.  At  intermediate  depths,  indi- vidual  recharge  events  were  associated  with  input events separated by a “critical” time interval that in- creased  with  depth.  The  relationship  between  re- charge,  precipitation  (P),  and  evapotranspiration (ET) for individual events were 1.5-m depth: R  = 0.87 · (P – 5.25) where all quantities are in cm. In nature the depth of the water table at a given location is determined by feedbacks among precipita- tion,  infiltration,  runoff,  and  evapotranspiration  at that location along with the regional flow, which inte- grates those quantities throughout the drainage basin under  the  influence  of  topography  and  geology.  On average,  the  water  table  is  at  an  equilibrium  depth such that the net recharge (i.e., percolation minus cap- illary rise to supply evapotranspiration) from above is just balanced by the net ground-water flow away from (recharge areas) or toward (discharge areas) the water table. When the water table is above this depth, losses to evapotranspiration exceed recharge and a discharge zone exists; when below this depth, recharge exceeds evapotranspiration and a recharge zone exists. Levine and Salvucci (1999) quantitatively mod- eled  these  relations  and  showed  how  water-table depth is related to net recharge for various soil types. They  found  that  net  recharge  increases  and  evapo- transpiration  and  surface  runoff  generally  decrease as  water-table  depth  increases  (figure  9.26).  Figure 9.27  on  p.  424  shows  regional  ground-water  flow and  recharge  and  discharge  zones  modeled  using these  more  realistic  relationships  in  climatic,  topo- graphic, and geologic conditions similar to those as- sumed  in  figure  9.7b.  Note  that  local,  intermediate, and regional circulations occur in both, but that dis- charge  zones  are  more  concentrated  in  figure  9.27. Salama et al. (1994) showed that aerial photographs and satellite imagery can be used to map regional re- charge and discharge areas. Because  of  the  difficulty  in  direct  measurement of  recharge,  hydrologists  have  attempted  to  evaluate by applying various combinations of water-balance concepts,  applications  of  Darcy’s  law,  soil-physics principles, mathematical systems models, and water- quality measurements.

When the water table is at its equilibrium depth, the net recharge from above is balanced by the net ground-water flow away from or toward the water table.

To evaluate recharge,  the  hydrographs  are  combined  with  hyeto- graphs showing the timing and amount of water input Part III: Water Movement on the Land (figure 9.28). Recharge is reflected in the rise of the hy- drograph  following  a  water-input  event,  after  which drainage to surface-water bodies is reflected in a grad- ual decline. There are several approaches to estimating Figure 9.27 Recharge areas, discharge areas, and streamlines for a cross section of a drainage basin in Alberta, Canada, as determined by coupling recharge estimated via unsaturated flow modeling with a ground-water flow model. Note that the discharge areas are more concentrated than predicted from ground-water flow modeling with imposed water-table configuration (compare figure 9.7) [Levine and Salvucci (1999).

Ground Water in the Hydrologic Cycle Part III: Water Movement on the Land Box 9.7 Drainage of a Linear-Reservoir Aquifer Figure 9.29 shows an idealized unconfined aquifer of area A and specific yield S  receiving recharge from infil- [L T–1], and discharging to a stream at a rate tration, R [L3 T– 1]. Assuming constant density, the conserva- tion-of-mass equation for a time period dt for this situa- Defining q  ≡ Q  /A, this becomes R q S . (9B7.2) If the aquifer behaves as a linear reservoir, outflow rate is proportional to storage [see equation (1.24)], where h  is a level below which no discharge occurs and k of the aquifer. With equation (9B7.3), (9B7.2) becomes R k S h S . (9B7.4) Figure 9.29 Definition diagram for analysis of drainage of a horizontal aquifer (box 9.7). If there is no recharge or capillary rise and the aquifer is draining, R  = 0 and equation (9B7.4) can be written as -k dt . (9B7.5) Integrating (9B7.5) yields and evaluating the constant of integration, C, from the initial condition h = h  when t = 0 leads to Equation (9B7.7) shows that drainage of a linear aqui- fer follows an exponential decay asymptotic to h  with decay constant k. Substituting equation (9B7.7) into equation (9B7.3) yields and we see that a linear aquifer produces ground-water outflow that also follows an exponential decay with the same decay constant. For well-hydrograph analysis, k is usually evaluated empirically as the slope of the hydro- graph when plotted on a semilogarithmic graph. If  recharge  from  streams  and  capillary  rise  are negligible,  the  ground-water  balance  equation,  ac- counting for storage changes, is where  now  denotes  the  change  in  storage  in  the aquifer. If the aquifer behaves as a linear reservoir, the analysis in box 9.7 shows that equation (9.27) becomes R k S h S has units of [L T–1], h is the water level in the aquifer, and h  is the level at which Q  becomes negligible. As shown in figure 9.28, the parameter k is evaluated as the slope of the straight line that best defines the hydrograph recessions when plotted on a semilogarithmic  graph,  and    can  be  evaluated  as the level to which the recessions become asymptotic during extended periods of no recharge. The seasonal variation  of    can  then  be  estimated  by  observing water-table elevations in monitoring wells and using equation (9.28).

Another  approach  to  well-hydrograph  analysis applies the linear-reservoir model in a somewhat dif- ferent  way.  Again,  assuming  an  exponential  reces- sion and referring to figure 9.28, recharge for event i, [L], becomes where h  and h  are the peak water levels associ- p,i p,i–1 ated with events i and i – 1, respectively; t  and t p,i p,i–1 are  the  times  of  occurrence  of  the  successive  peak water levels; and S is the specific yield. Rasmussen and  Andreasen  (1959)  obtained  reasonable  results with this method in Maryland, with a constant S  de- termined via successive approximations as the value most consistent with weekly water-balance data. A  third  approach  to  estimating  recharge  from well  hydrographs applies a simplified water-balance equation to the entire aquifer of area A: I y in out where    is  the  spatial  average  increase  in  aquifer water level in response to a water-input event and G and G  are the ground-water inflows and outflows, respectively, to the aquifer. Van Tonder and Kirchner (1990) suggested estimating the G terms by approxi- mating Darcy’s law as Ground Water in the Hydrologic Cycle where G is the appropriate flow rate, T is the trans- missivity [equation (9.11)] for the inflow or outflow boundary, L is the width of the boundary, and i  and are the hydraulic gradients at the boundary at the beginning and end of the observation period, respec- tively.  Van  Tonder  and  Kirchner  (1990)  found  that this  method  was  the  only  one  to  give  reliable  esti- mates  of  recharge  in  clastic  sedimentary  rock  aqui- fers in South Africa. Das Gupta and Paudyal (1988) showed  how  an  approximate  analytical  solution  of the  one-dimensional  ground-water  flow  equation could be used to account for the G terms when equa- tion (9.31) is applied to an aquifer. Although  the  studies  cited  above  have  claimed success in estimating recharge from well-hydrograph analysis,  the  approach  is  subject  to  two  sources  of potentially large uncertainty: Difficulty  of  determining  the  appropriate  areal yield:  A  characteristic  value  of value  of  specific for  the  aquifer  material  is  often  assumed,  but this can range widely (table 9.1). Furthermore, the specific  yield  cannot  in  general  be  assumed  con- stant in the near-surface zones of aquifers. This is especially  true  if  the  water  table  is  within  a  few meters of the surface, where water contents are a function of depth due to the complex interplay of infiltration, percolation, and capillary rise. In gen- eral,  the  equilibrium  water-content  profile  varies with  the  water-table  elevation  (figure  8.8),  so  a Part III: Water Movement on the Land given water-table rise represents different amounts of recharge depending on the elevation range cov- ered. Another cause of inconstancy in S  is related t o   th e   w e t ti n g / d r y i n g   h y s t e re s is   in   s o i ls   (f i g u r e 7 .1 7 ):   I n  a   w e t ti n g   s o i l,   a ir   b u b b le s  a r e   ty p i c a l ly trapped in the pores, so that S  for a rising water table  is  generally  less  than  for  a  falling  water table.

This latter  phenomenon  is  especially  likely  to  occur where  the  capillary  fringe  extends  up  to  the  soil surface;  infiltrating  water  can  then  cause  an  al- most  instantaneous  rise  of  the  water  table  to  the surface with virtually no change in ground-water storage  (Novakowski  and  Gillham  1988;  this  is discussed further in section 10.4.3.2).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of well hydrograph analysis, what is the significance of the rise and decline of the hydrograph following a water-input event?", "answer": "The rise of the hydrograph following a water-input event reflects recharge, while the gradual decline represents drainage to surface-water bodies.

These methods provide valuable insights into groundwater recharge but are subject to uncertainties, such as determining the appropriate areal yield and specific yield for the aquifer material."}, {"question": "Why is determining the specific yield of an aquifer material challenging, and what factors contribute to its variability?", "answer": "Determining the specific yield of an aquifer material is challenging because it can range widely and is not constant in the near-surface zones of aquifers. The specific yield varies with the water-table elevation due to the complex interplay of infiltration, percolation, and capillary rise. Additionally, the wetting/drying hysteresis in soils affects the specific yield, making it generally less for a rising water table than for a falling water table. This variability in specific yield can lead to significant errors in recharge estimates if a constant value is assumed, as demonstrated by Sophocleous and Perry (1985)."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, how does the concept of a linear-reservoir aquifer simplify the analysis of drainage and recharge?", "answer": "The concept of a linear-reservoir aquifer simplifies the analysis of drainage and recharge by assuming that the outflow rate is proportional to storage. This assumption allows for the use of a conservation-of-mass equation to model the aquifer's behavior, where the change in storage is related to the recharge and discharge rates. The linear-reservoir model provides a straightforward way to estimate parameters such as k, which represents the decay constant of the aquifer, and to analyze the exponential decay of the hydrograph recessions. However, this simplification may not always accurately represent the complex dynamics of real aquifers, especially when factors like capillary rise and pressurization of the capillary fringe are significant."}, {"question": "What are the potential sources of uncertainty in estimating recharge from well-hydrograph analysis, and how do they impact the accuracy of recharge estimates?", "answer": "The potential sources of uncertainty in estimating recharge from well-hydrograph analysis include the difficulty of determining the appropriate areal yield and the assumption of a constant specific yield for the aquifer material. These uncertainties can lead to significant errors in recharge estimates, as the specific yield can vary widely and is affected by factors such as the water-table elevation and wetting/drying hysteresis in soils.

The balance for such a tracer is given by the equation W = C · R, where W is water input, C is the concentration of the tracer in the water input, and R is the concentration in groundwater at the water table.

This cessation of production means that CFCs can no longer be used as tracers for groundwater recharge because their concentrations in the atmosphere and, consequently, in precipitation and groundwater, will decrease over time, making them unreliable for estimating recharge rates."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater recharge estimation, how do the criteria for selecting a chemical tracer impact the accuracy of recharge estimates?", "answer": "The criteria for selecting a chemical tracer significantly impact the accuracy of recharge estimates. If a tracer is not present in measurable amounts in precipitation, or if it is taken up or released in the vadose zone or by vegetation, it can lead to inaccurate estimates of recharge. For instance, if a tracer is involved in soil-chemical reactions, its concentration in groundwater may not accurately reflect the recharge rate, leading to errors in estimation.

By measuring the concentration of a tracer in groundwater and comparing it to its concentration in precipitation, researchers can estimate the recharge rate using the equation W = C · R. This relationship provides a powerful tool for quantifying groundwater recharge and understanding the dynamics of the hydrologic cycle."}, {"question": "Why is it essential to consider the long-term averages of water input, tracer concentration, and recharge rate when using chemical tracers for groundwater recharge estimation?", "answer": "Considering long-term averages is essential because it helps to account for temporal variability in precipitation, tracer concentration, and recharge rate. By averaging these parameters over a long period, researchers can smooth out short-term fluctuations and obtain a more representative estimate of the recharge rate.

{"paragraph": "9.5.3.6.3 Arbitrary Base-Flow Separation Methods In  practice,  base-flow  separation  is  assumed  to represent  ,  and  base-flow  separation  is  usually Part III: Water Movement on the Land done  by  plotting  the  measured  stream  hydrograph and constructing by arbitrary methods a line coinci- dent with or below the hydrograph that is designated the  base  flow.  Construction  of  the  line  requires  an- swers to the following questions: (1) How does base flow behave while the stream is responding to water input? and (2) At what point does base flow become equal to total flow? The  theoretical  analyses  just  described  may  pro- vide plausible guidance in answering these questions. However,  because  no  information  as  to  the  true sources  of  stream  flow  is  usually  available,  many purely  arbitrary  approaches  to  separation  have  been proposed. In fact, base-flow separation has been called “one of the most desperate analysis techniques in use in hydrology” (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967, p. 276). Three  arbitrary  separation  methods  that  have been  used  on  relatively  small  watersheds  are  de- scribed  in  figure  9.34;  others  are  described  by  Na- Arnold and Allen (1999), and Chapman (1999). One of  the  most  widely  used  methods  for  larger  water- sheds  was  developed  by  the  Institute  of  Hydrology (UK) (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology); this  is  described  in  box  9.8  and  illustrated  in  figure 9.35.  This  method  is  usually  used  to  calculate  the base-flow index (BFI), defined as where Q   are  daily  base-flow  values  determined  by the  method,  and    are  average  daily  streamflows. Similar  computations  of  the  relative  magnitude  of base flow can be based on other separation methods. In  a  region  of  generally  similar  geology,  larger watersheds  tend  to  have  more  storage  and  a  higher proportion  of  base  flow.  A  watershed  containing very  permeable  soils  or  low  slopes  typically  has  a high proportion of base flow (e.g., BFI > 0.95), while one with high slopes underlain by impermeable ma- terial  has  a  low  proportion  (BFI  <  0.2).  If  relations between BFI and watershed properties can be estab- lished, they may provide a basis for inferring stream behavior  in  watersheds  where  flow  measurements have  not  been  made.  Kling  and  Nachtnebel  (2009) presented  a  simple  method  for  the  regional  estima- tion of runoff-separation parameters for the monthly water-balance  model  using  the  BFI  and  catchment characteristics, and Santhi et al. (2008) mapped BFI values for the United States and related them to hy- drologic landscape regions and watershed properties such as relief and percentage of sand. Note  that  the  total  volume  of  base  flow  varies greatly  depending  on  the  separation  method  used. This  illustrates  the  crucial  point:  If  a  consistent method is applied, base-flow separation can be a use- ful  tool  for  comparing  the  relative  contributions  of ground water to streamflow in different watersheds. However, All base-flow separation methods are based on assumptions and require arbitrary decisions; thus, by themselves they cannot be used to identify the actual ground-water component of streamflow (Freeze 1972a; Anderson and Burt 1980).

In humid regions with gaining streams, lakes, and wetlands, much of this increase in recharge will be due to water loss from surface water."}, {"question": "In what situations can a new equilibrium state be reached in which there is no further change in storage, and what conditions must be met for this to occur?", "answer": "A new equilibrium state may eventually be reached in which there is no further change in storage (ΔS/Δt = 0) if a constant rate of ground-water extraction is imposed on a region for a sufficient time. For this to occur, the extraction rate (ΣQ ) must be supplied by increased recharge (ΔR  + ΔR > 0) and/or reduced discharge (ΔQ < 0). However, the time required to reach this equilibrium may be very long indeed, depending on the region’s size, hydrology, and geology, and on the locations and pumping rates of wells."}, {"question": "How does the cone of depression from wells near streams affect the local potential gradient and induce recharge from the stream?", "answer": "The cone of depression from wells near streams can extend to the stream, locally reverse the potential gradient, and induce recharge from the stream. This effect is particularly significant in humid regions with gaining streams, where the lowered water table can intercept water that was flowing to the river, thereby increasing recharge."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to evaluate the impact of groundwater extraction on a given situation, and what type of studies are required to assess this impact?", "answer": "It is challenging to evaluate the impact of groundwater extraction on a given situation because the time required to reach a new equilibrium state may be very long, and the system's response to pumping depends on various factors, including the region's size, hydrology, and geology, and the locations and pumping rates of wells. Detailed ground-water modeling studies are required to evaluate a given situation and assess the impact of groundwater extraction on the system. These studies can help predict the effects of pumping on the water table, recharge, and discharge, and inform management decisions to ensure sustainable groundwater use."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater development, what is meant by \"mining\" of aquifer storage, and does it occur with any extraction rate?", "answer": "\"Mining\" of aquifer storage refers to the removal of water from aquifer storage, which occurs with any extraction rate. However, if a constant rate of ground-water extraction is imposed on a region for a sufficient time, a new equilibrium state may eventually be reached in which there is no further change in storage, and the extraction rate is supplied by increased recharge and/or reduced discharge."}, {"question": "How does the placement and pumping rate of wells influence the magnitude of the effect of groundwater development on recharge and discharge?", "answer": "The placement and pumping rate of wells can significantly influence the magnitude of the effect of groundwater development on recharge and discharge. Wells located near streams or surface-water bodies can induce recharge from these sources, while wells located in areas with low permeability or high water tables may have a more limited impact on recharge. The pumping rate of wells also affects the magnitude of the cone of depression and the resulting changes in recharge and discharge. Therefore, careful consideration of well placement and pumping rates is essential for managing groundwater resources sustainably."}]}

{"paragraph": "9.6.2.3 Salt-Water Intrusion Consider  a  well  located  above  the  fresh-salt  in- terface in a coastal aquifer like that shown in figure 9.23.  By  the  Ghyben–Herzberg  principle  (box  9.5), the  elevation  of  the  interface  will  increase  by  40  m for every 1 m in drawdown caused by pumping. Thus if the drawdown at the well approaches 1/40th of the vertical distance between the bottom of the well and the interface, the well is likely to pump salt water. To  the  extent  that  the  idealized  conditions  as- sumed  in  deriving  them  are  not  satisfied,  equations (9.57)–(9.59)  will  not  exactly  predict  the  drawdown in a coastal aquifer. This may occur when the aquifer is not quasi-infinite, the well is not fully penetrating, or  the  interface  between  fresh  and  salt  water  is  not sharp.  Modified  versions  of  those  equations  are available  to  account  for  these  complicating  condi- tions (Freeze and Cherry 1979). 9.6.3 “Safe Yield” It is widely believed, even by many hydrologists and  water-resource  managers,  that  the  sustainable rate of extraction—or “safe yield”—of ground water Figure 9.43 The stream- depletion function, D (t)/Q , · t/(x2 · as a function of K  · h S ).

It should be clear from the preceding discussion that this is not true: Equation (9.62) shows that the rate of extraction is supplied by a decrease in storage and, in general, by changes in recharge and/or discharge. itself  does  not  enter  into  that  equation,  and  in fact is relevant to the determination of safe yield only to  the  extent  that  it  should  be  accounted  for  in ground-water models (Bredehoeft et al. 1982; Brede- hoeft 1997, 2002; Zhou 2009). Instead, Safe yield (or sustainable yield) is best defined as the rate at which ground water can be withdrawn without producing undesirable effects (Lohman 1979). The preceding discussion has identified the most important  hydrologic  impacts  of  ground-water  ex- traction, and most of these have potentially undesir- able effects: • Reductions  of  streamflow  may  seriously  reduce surface  water  available  for  instream  (e.g.,  wildlife habitat,  waste  dilution,  hydropower,  recreation, navigation)  and  withdrawal  (water  supply,  irriga- tion) uses. • Levels  and/or  extents  of  lakes  and  wetlands  may be reduced, with consequent loss of valued habitat and recreational value. Chapter 9 • Extent  of  areas  where  water  is  available  to  plants that  exploit  the  capillary  fringe  (phreatophytes) may be reduced, with consequent loss of habitat. • Ground-water  outflow  to  the  ocean  may  be  re- duced, with consequent effect on coastal wetlands and/or nearshore benthic marine habitats. • Lowered water table may cause land subsidence as some  of  the  overburden  stresses  formerly  sup- ported by ground water are transferred to the min- eral grains (box 9.2). Land subsidence of up to 9 m has occurred due to extraction of ground water for irrigation in the Central Valley of California. • Costs of pumping, which are proportional to depth of water table, rise. • Water tables lowered by one developer may fall be- low  depths  of  nearby  wells  belonging  to  others, perhaps resulting in legal action.

What are the most important potential adverse impacts of ground-water development in your  region?  Is  there  evidence  that  any  of  these  impacts would you recommend for determining safe yield in your region? Ground-water hydrologists often distinguish between the primary porosity, which is the original inter- granular  porosity  of  a  soil  or  sedimentary  deposit,  and  the secondary spaces developed subsequently by fracturing and/or dissolution. The effect of pumping on the ground-water balance is considered in the last section of this chapter. As described in sections 7.4.1 and 8.1.4, this water movement occurs in response to pressure gradients created by evapotranspiration that reduces the liquid water content in the vadose zone. Capillary rise can be a significant portion of basin evapotranspiration in many semiarid and arid regions where a class of vascular plants called phreatophytes grows near streams and obtains water via roots that extend to the capillary fringe. Saltcedar, arrowweed, cottonwood, cattails, and willows are common phreatophytes.

Resources.  The  flow  in  streams  constitutes the  sustainable  water  resource  available  for human  use  and  management  (section  1.8.1)  and for stream organisms. (Note that this includes the ground-water  resource,  because  virtually  all ground water discharges to surface-water bodies.) 2. Forecasting. Flood  Prediction  and Flood  predic- tions are estimates of the probabilities of floods of various  magnitudes;  they  are  the  basis  for  the design of bridges, dams, and levees and the formu- lation  of  floodplain  land-use  plans  and  regula- tions.  forecasts  are  estimates  of  the magnitudes  of  flooding  produced  by  a  rain  or snowmelt event that is occurring or is forecast to occur; these are used to guide the operation of res- ervoir  systems  and  to  provide  flood  warnings  to floodplain occupants. Runoff Generation and Streamflow 3. Water Quality. Water quality (temperature, inorganic and  organic  dissolved  constituents,  and  particulate material),  which  affects  the  suitability  of  water  for use  by  humans  and  natural  organisms,  is  strongly influenced by physical processes and chemical and biological reactions that occur as water moves over and through the land surface toward streams. The principal focuses of this chapter are: (1) a re- view  of  the  watershed  concept  and  a  description  of stream networks; (2) a conceptual overview of the es- sential characteristics of stream responses to water in- puts;  (3)  a  survey  of  the  processes  and  routes  by which  water  enters  streams  and  moves  through  the watershed  stream  network  in  response  to  rain  and snowmelt  events;  and  (4)  an  introduction  to  some commonly  used  approaches  to  forecasting  and  pre- dicting stream responses (“rainfall-runoff modeling”).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of coastal aquifers, how does the Ghyben-Herzberg principle relate to salt-water intrusion?", "answer": "The Ghyben-Herzberg principle states that the elevation of the fresh-salt interface will increase by 40 m for every 1 m in drawdown caused by pumping, thus increasing the likelihood of salt-water intrusion if the drawdown at the well approaches 1/40th of the vertical distance between the bottom of the well and the interface."}, {"question": "Why is the concept of \"safe yield\" in groundwater extraction complex and not simply equal to the rate of natural recharge?", "answer": "The concept of \"safe yield\" is complex because it involves considering various hydrologic effects of groundwater extraction, such as reductions in streamflow, lake and wetland levels, and ground-water outflow to the ocean, as well as economic, social, environmental, and legal consequences. It is not simply equal to the rate of natural recharge because the rate of extraction is supplied by a decrease in storage and changes in recharge and/or discharge, and the sustainable rate of extraction must be determined by balancing the benefits of groundwater use against the undesirable consequences of extraction."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater flow, what are some of the potential adverse impacts of groundwater development?", "answer": "Some potential adverse impacts of groundwater development include reductions in streamflow, lowered water tables, land subsidence, increased costs of pumping, and salt-water intrusion. These impacts can have significant economic, social, environmental, and legal consequences, and must be carefully considered when determining the safe yield of a groundwater system."}, {"question": "How do the assumptions involved in deriving the well function apply to a typical aquifer in a given region?", "answer": "The assumptions involved in deriving the well function, such as the aquifer being homogeneous and isotropic, may not always apply to a typical aquifer in a given region. The specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and other aquifer properties can vary significantly, affecting the accuracy of the well function. Therefore, it is essential to consider the local hydrogeology and adjust the well function accordingly to ensure accurate predictions of drawdown and groundwater flow."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between groundwater and surface water in terms of streamflow generation?", "answer": "Groundwater plays a crucial role in streamflow generation, as it contributes to the base flow of streams and rivers. The interaction between groundwater and surface water is complex, with groundwater feeding into streams and rivers, and surface water recharging groundwater. Understanding this relationship is essential for managing water resources and predicting stream responses to rainfall and snowmelt events."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to determine the safe yield of a groundwater system?", "answer": "Determining the safe yield of a groundwater system is challenging because it requires considering multiple factors, including the hydrologic effects of groundwater extraction, economic and social consequences, and environmental and legal implications. The safe yield is not simply a function of the rate of natural recharge, but rather a complex balance of these factors. Additionally, the uncertainty in estimates of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and other hydrologic parameters can make it difficult to accurately determine the safe yield."}, {"question": "In the context of groundwater modeling, what is the significance of the stream-depletion function?", "answer": "The stream-depletion function is a critical component of groundwater modeling, as it describes the relationship between groundwater extraction and streamflow depletion. The function takes into account the distance between the well and the stream, the aquifer properties, and the pumping rate, allowing for the prediction of streamflow depletion and the evaluation of the impacts of groundwater extraction on surface water resources."}, {"question": "How does the concept of \"safe yield\" relate to the environmental and social implications of groundwater extraction?", "answer": "The concept of \"safe yield\" is closely tied to the environmental and social implications of groundwater extraction, as it aims to balance the benefits of groundwater use against the potential adverse impacts on the environment and society. The safe yield must consider factors such as the protection of aquatic ecosystems, the maintenance of groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and the prevention of land subsidence, salt-water intrusion, and other negative consequences. By considering these factors, the safe yield can be determined in a way that minimizes harm to the environment and society while still allowing for the sustainable use of groundwater resources."}, {"question": "What are the implications of groundwater extraction on the water table and land subsidence?", "answer": "Groundwater extraction can lead to a decline in the water table, resulting in land subsidence as the overburden stresses formerly supported by groundwater are transferred to the mineral grains. This can cause significant damage to infrastructure, ecosystems, and human settlements, and can also lead to increased costs of pumping and decreased water quality. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage groundwater extraction to prevent or mitigate these impacts."}]}
{"paragraph": "10.1.1 The Watershed As  defined  in  section  1.7,  a  watershed  (also called  drainage  basin,  river  basin,  or  catchment)  is Part III: Water Movement on the Land the  area  that  topographically  appears  to  contribute all  the  water  that  passes  through  a  specified  cross section  of  a  stream  (the  watershed  outlet;  figure 1.10).

These factors influence how precipitation is transformed into streamflow, affecting the volume, rate, and chemical composition of the water."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological processes, how does the concept of a watershed outlet relate to the overall water balance of a watershed?", "answer": "The watershed outlet is a critical point in the hydrological process, as it marks the location where water accumulated from the entire watershed is discharged. The water balance of a watershed is essentially the balance between inputs (such as precipitation) and outputs (such as streamflow at the outlet and evapotranspiration) over a given period. Understanding the watershed outlet's role in this balance is essential for assessing the overall hydrological behavior of the watershed and for managing water resources effectively. The outlet's streamflow characteristics, such as volume and quality, reflect the integrated effects of all hydrological processes occurring within the watershed, making it a key indicator of watershed health and function."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the origin of water passing through a stream cross-section important for hydrological studies?", "answer": "Understanding the origin of water, specifically that at least most of it originates as precipitation on the watershed, is important for hydrological studies because it highlights the direct link between watershed characteristics and streamflow. This understanding is crucial for predicting how changes in precipitation patterns, land use, or other watershed attributes might impact streamflow and water quality, allowing for more informed decision-making in water resource management and conservation efforts."}, {"question": "In the context of water resource management, what are the implications of changes in watershed characteristics on streamflow and water quality?", "answer": "Changes in watershed"}]}

Figure 10.1 shows the most common approach to quantita- tively  describing  stream  networks  (Strahler  1952): Streams  with  no  tributaries  are  designated first-or- streams;  the  confluence  of  two  first-order streams  is  the  beginning  of  a  stream; second-order the  confluence  of  two  second-order  streams  pro- duces a third-order stream, etc. When a stream of a given  order  receives a tributary  of a lower  order, its order  does  not  change.  The  order  is  the watershed order of the stream at the watershed outlet. The ac- tual size of the streams designated a particular order depends on the scale of the map or image used and the  conventions  used  in  defining  stream  channels (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral; section 9.3.1.2).

Additionally, the dynamic nature of stream networks, with channels changing over time due to erosion or human intervention, can make it challenging to maintain an up-to-date and accurate representation of the network magnitude. These challenges can be addressed through the use of advanced remote sensing technologies, such as high-resolution satellite imagery or lidar, to improve mapping accuracy, and by incorporating temporal dynamics into stream network models to account for changes over time.

It  can  be  shown  from straightforward geometry that the average spacing of streams, X, is Therefore the divide-to-stream distance (i.e., the av- erage hillslope length) is approximately 1/(2 · D) and the average distance that a drop of water travels to a stream is about 1/(4 · D). Thus drainage density is an indicator  of  the  efficiency  of  a  stream  network  in draining an area, especially if its definition is modi- fied to eliminate the effects of stream sinuosity: where ΣL is the total length of stream valleys and D   is called the effective drainage density (Dingman 1978).

A continuous graph of stream dis- charge  versus  time  is  a  hydrograph;  for streamflow direct  comparison  with  the  input,  discharge  may  be divided by watershed area and expressed as [L T–1]. The  hydrograph  of  a  stream  responding  to  an isolated  period  of  rain  or  snowmelt  of  significant magnitude  and  areal  extent  usually  has  the  charac- teristic form shown in figure 10.4a: At some time af- ter the beginning of the event the flow rate begins to increase relatively rapidly from the preevent rate to a well-defined peak discharge; this period is called the rise.

Figure 10.3 shows that streamflow is a spatially and  temporally  integrated  response  determined  by: (1) the spatially and temporally varying input rates; (2) the time required for each drop of water to travel from  where  it  strikes  the  watershed  surface  to  the stream  network  (determined  by  the  length,  slope, vegetative cover, soils, and geology of the watershed hillslopes);  and  (3)  the  time  required  for  water  to travel from its entrance into the channel to the point of  measurement  (determined  by  the  length  and  na- ture of the channel network). In small watersheds (less than about 50 km2 area), the travel time to the watershed outlet is typically determined mostly by the hillslope travel time; for larger watersheds the travel time in the stream network becomes increasingly important (Kirkby 1993).

Figure  10.5  shows  a  typical  example  of  how  the effects of hillslope-response mechanisms are gradually modified by the effects of spatial and temporal integra- tion and channel hydraulics through a stream network. The hydrograph shape for the smallest watershed (fig- ure 10.5b) is strongly influenced by the form of the hy- etograph (figure 10.5a). Subsequently, the hydrograph is increasingly affected by tributary inputs and by the storage effects of the watershed and stream channels, and the net result is an increase in the lag time between the rainfall inputs and the peaks and a decrease in hy- drograph  ordinates  (when  scaled  by  drainage  area). The  hydrograph  also  becomes  smoother,  and  at  the lowest two gauges the formerly multiple-peaked hydro- graph has become single-peaked. In attempting to analyze and model these event- response  processes,  it  is  important  to  keep  the  fol- lowing points in mind. On the hillslopes: • Water moves in an infinite number of surface and/or  subsurface  flow  paths  of  varying length and character. Chapter 10 • During the  water-input event,  each flow  path is  an  accumulation  of  inflows  of  pre- cipitation and/or snowmelt that vary in space and time (figure 10.3b). • Flow  in  each  path  can  in  principle  be  de- scribed  by  invoking  the  conservation  of  mass and an equation of motion appropriate to the mode  of  flow.  The  principles  of  unsaturated and saturated subsurface  flow were discussed in chapter 7; the principles of surface overland flow are discussed in section 10.4.2.

[Dunne and Leopold (1978)]. Runoff Generation and Streamflow In the stream network: • During the event, and while the land surface is draining,  flow  is  an  accumulation  of  tempo- rally and spatially varying lateral inflows from the  hillslope  flow  paths  distributed  along  the channel length (figure 10.3b). • Movement  of  water  in  the  stream  can  be  de- scribed  by  invoking  the  conservation  of  mass and  the  equation of  motion  for  open-channel flow.  These  principles  are  introduced  in  sec- tion 10.5. Part III: Water Movement on the Land • Flow  in  the  stream  takes  the  form  of  a  flood wave  that  moves  downstream  through  the stream network (figure 10.4). • The  observed  hydrograph  records  the  move- ment of the flood wave past the stream-gauging station at the watershed outlet (figure 10.4). In the overall watershed response: • The  volume  of  water  appearing  in  the  appar- ent  response  hydrograph  for  a  given  event  is usually only a fraction (often a very small frac- tion) of the  total input. The  remainder  of the water input ultimately leaves the watershed as: (1) evapotranspiration; (2) streamflow that oc- curs  so  long  after  the  event  that  it  cannot  be associated with that event; or (3) ground-water outflow from the watershed. • The water identified as the response to a given event  may  originate  on  only  a  fraction  of  the watershed;  this  fraction  is  called  the contrib- uting area. • The  extent  of  the  contributing  area  may  vary from event to event and during an event. • At least some of the water identified as the re- sponse  to  a  given  event  may  be  “old  water” that entered the watershed in a previous event.

It is also influenced by the spatial and temporal integration of flow paths and the effects of hillslope-response mechanisms. As the flood wave moves through the stream network, its shape changes due to additional inputs, hydraulic effects, and storage effects."}, {"question": "How do hillslope travel times and stream network travel times influence the hydrograph in small versus large watersheds?", "answer": "In small watersheds, the travel time to the watershed outlet is typically determined mostly by the hillslope travel time, whereas in larger watersheds, the travel time in the stream network becomes increasingly important. This difference affects the timing and shape of the hydrograph, with larger watersheds exhibiting a more complex response due to the greater influence of the stream network. The relative importance of hillslope versus stream network travel times has implications for understanding and predicting watershed response to rainfall or snowmelt events."}, {"question": "Why does the hydrograph become smoother and less peaked as it moves downstream through the stream network?", "answer": "The hydrograph becomes smoother and less peaked as it moves downstream because the effects of spatial and temporal integration and channel hydraulics gradually modify the hillslope-response mechanisms. As the flood wave passes through the stream network, it is influenced by tributary inputs, storage effects, and hydraulic effects, which tend to dampen the peaks and increase the lag time between rainfall inputs and the peaks. This process results in a more uniform and less variable hydrograph shape, as observed in the example of the Sleepers River in Danville, Vermont."}, {"question": "In the context of streamflow generation, what is the role of the conservation of mass and the equation of motion for open-channel flow?", "answer": "The conservation of mass and the equation of motion for open-channel flow are fundamental principles that describe the movement of water in the stream network. These principles allow for the analysis and modeling of streamflow generation, taking into account the accumulation of temporally and spatially varying lateral inflows from the hillslope flow paths. By invoking these principles, hydrologists can better understand the complex processes involved in streamflow generation and predict the response of watersheds to rainfall or snowmelt events."}, {"question": "How does the contributing area of a watershed vary during an event, and what implications does this have for understanding watershed response?", "answer": "The contributing area of a watershed may vary from event to event and during an event, as different parts of the watershed respond to rainfall or snowmelt. This variability has significant implications for understanding watershed response, as the water identified as the response to a given event may originate on only a fraction of the watershed. Furthermore, at least some of the water identified as the response to a given event may be \"old water\" that entered the watershed in a previous event, highlighting the complexity and dynamic nature of watershed response."}, {"question": "Why is it important to consider the spatial and temporal integration of flow paths when analyzing watershed response?", "answer": "Considering the spatial and temporal integration of flow paths is crucial for understanding watershed response because it allows for the accounting of the various flow paths and their contributions to the overall response. By integrating the effects of hillslope-response mechanisms, channel hydraulics, and tributary inputs, hydrologists can better predict the timing, shape, and magnitude of the hydrograph. This integrated approach is essential for accurately modeling and analyzing watershed response to rainfall or snowmelt events."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed response, what happens to the water input that does not appear in the apparent response hydrograph?", "answer": "The water input that does not appear in the apparent response hydrograph ultimately leaves the watershed as evapotranspiration, streamflow that occurs long after the event, or groundwater outflow from the watershed. This highlights the importance of considering the various pathways and fate of water in the watershed, as the response to a given event is often only a fraction of the total input."}, {"question": "How do channel characteristics, such as geometry, slope, and bed and bank material, influence the shape of the hydrograph?", "answer": "Channel characteristics, such as geometry, slope, and bed and bank material, influence the shape of the hydrograph by affecting the movement of the flood wave through the stream network. These characteristics can modify the timing, shape, and magnitude of the hydrograph, with steeper slopes and narrower channels tend to produce more rapid and peaked responses, while gentler slopes and wider channels produce more gradual and smoothed responses. The interaction between channel characteristics and the flood wave is complex, and understanding these relationships is essential for predicting watershed response."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to analyze and model watershed response to rainfall or snowmelt events?", "answer": "Analyzing and modeling watershed response to"}]}

Figure  10.6  shows  the  response  of  a  small watershed to an isolated rainfall lasting about 15 hr. As  in  most  humid-region  streams,  there  is  nonzero flow  before  the  event  and  gradually  declining  flow Box 10.1 In this chapter, we use the following notation: p rate of water input (rain plus snowmelt) in a storm event [L T–1] p* rate of effective water input (≡ water that appears as streamflow in response to a water-input event) P total volume of water input in a storm event [L] or P* total  volume  of  effective  water  input  in  a  storm event [L] or [L3] persisting long after the event and the obvious hydro- graph response. Clearly some of the flow during the hydrograph rise must have entered the watershed in previous events, and some of the water that entered during  the  current  event  will  flow  out  of  the  water- shed well after the identifiable hydrograph response. In the context of analyzing stream responses to rain events,4 usually for the purpose of developing meth- ods for predicting or forecasting floods, this raises a central question: How do we identify the portion of stream response that is associated with a given event? Note  that  this  practical  question  is  different  from, but  related  to,  the  more  scientific  question,  “What are  the  sources  of  streamflow  and  the  routes  by which water enters streams?” This latter question is addressed in sections 10.3 and 10.4. Except  in  specialized  research  situations,  the only data available on which to base the quantifica- tion of event flow are measurements of total rainfall and total streamflow. Since this streamflow includes water  from  the  event  of  interest  plus  an  indetermi- nate  number  of  preceding  events,  the  problem  of identifying response to a particular event arises. This problem is the complement of the question of base- separation,  used  to  identify  probable  ground- water  contributions  to  streamflow  discussed  in  sec- tion 9.5.3.6.

Base flow, on the other hand, is the portion of streamflow presumed to have entered the watershed in previous events, derived from persistent, slowly varying sources like groundwater.

This variability highlights the importance of considering antecedent conditions in hydrological modeling and prediction. The implications of not accounting for these conditions can lead to inaccurate predictions, especially during periods of extreme wetness or dryness, underscoring the need for dynamic models that incorporate temporal variability."}, {"question": "In what scenarios might it be less important to account for temporal variability in watershed conditions?", "answer": "It might be less important to account for temporal variability if one restricts consideration to large floods, when the watershed is generally wet and contributing area may be fairly constant, as suggested by Askew (1970) and Pilgrim (1976). However, this does not negate the importance of understanding temporal variability for other hydrological events or conditions."}, {"question": "What is the implication of the high degree of temporal variability in Q*/P for hydrological modeling and prediction?", "answer": "The high degree of temporal variability in Q*/P implies that hydrological models must account for time-varying watershed conditions to accurately predict watershed response. This requires a deep understanding of the physical processes that produce the Q*/P relation and the ability to incorporate these processes into predictive models. The challenge lies in capturing the dynamic nature of watershed wetness and its impact on hydrological response, which can vary significantly over time and between different regions."}, {"question": "How does watershed wetness influence the hydrological response of a watershed to a storm event?", "answer": "Watershed wetness, or antecedent condition, has a major influence on the Q*/P ratio, indicating that it significantly affects the hydrological response of a watershed to a storm event. A wet watershed will have a higher Q*/P ratio compared to a dry watershed, given similar storm characteristics, due to the increased runoff potential in wet conditions. This relationship underscores the importance of considering watershed wetness in hydrological analyses and predictions."}, {"question": "In the context of the provided examples, what can be inferred about the role of antecedent conditions in determining hydrological response?", "answer": "The examples, such as the comparison between the hydrological responses in the summers of 1963 and 1965 in northern Alaska, infer that antecedent conditions play a critical role in determining the hydrological response of a watershed. The significant difference in Q*/P ratios between these two periods highlights the impact of watershed wetness on runoff generation and the importance of accounting for these conditions in hydrological assessments."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the physical processes behind the Q*/P relation crucial for hydrological modeling?", "answer": "Understanding the physical processes behind the Q*/P relation is crucial because it allows for the development of more accurate and dynamic hydrological models. These models can better capture the temporal variability in watershed response and provide more reliable predictions of hydrological events. The physical processes, influenced by factors such as watershed wetness, are key to explaining the variability observed in Q*/P ratios and must be well-represented in models to ensure their applicability across different hydrological scenarios."}, {"question": "How does the temporal variability in Q*/P ratios across different storms and periods reflect the complexity of hydrological systems?", "answer": "The temporal variability in Q*/P ratios reflects the complexity of hydrological systems by demonstrating how watershed response can change significantly over time due to factors like watershed wetness. This variability indicates that hydrological systems are dynamic and influenced by a range of factors, including antecedent moisture conditions, which can complicate predictions and modeling efforts. The complexity underscores the need for comprehensive and adaptive approaches to hydrological modeling and prediction."}, {"question": "What are the implications of temporal variability in watershed response for water resource management and planning?", "answer": "The implications of temporal variability in watershed response for water resource management and planning are significant, as it affects the accuracy of predictions and the effectiveness of management strategies.

{"paragraph": "10.2.4 Quantitative Description of Response Hydrographs The terms used to analyze response hydrographs and relate them to event hyetographs are defined on figure 10.12 and in table 10.2 and are discussed be- low. Note that here we are focusing only on (1) the portion  of  streamflow  identified  as  event  flow,  Q*, and  (2)  the  fraction  of  water  input  that  appears  as event  flow,  called  the  rainfall  or effective  excess rainfall, P*. These volumes are equal: P* = Q*. Runoff Generation and Streamflow For  forecasting  or  predicting  the  runoff  response  to rainfall, we need some a priori method of separating P*  from  total  for  a  given  storm.  Various  ap- proaches  to  this  problem  are  discussed  in  sections 10.6.3 and 10.6.4. In  figure  10.12,  water  input  begins  at  time and  ends  at  ;  the  input  duration  (often  called storm duration), is T  – t . Stream response, or hydrograph rise, begins at t  and usually continues more or less steadily to a peak flow, q , at time t . Typically  the  peak  occurs  when  or  soon  after  input ceases.  The  delay  between  the  beginning  of  input and the beginning of the rise is the response lag, T . The time between the beginning of input and peak is the lag-to-peak, T . The dura- tion of the hydrograph rise is called the time of rise, Part III: Water Movement on the Land Table 10.2 Definitions of Terms Used to Describe Hyetographs and Response Hydrographs (see figure 10.12).

Following the peak, the response declines quasi-exponentially as water input drains  from  watershed  storage;  response  ceases  at time  .  The  total  duration  of  the  response  hydro- graph is called the time base, T . The centroid, or center of mass, of the input, t , is the weighted-average time of occurrence of the in- put hyetograph. If we have values of input, P sured for i = 1, 2, ..., n time periods of equal length, the  centroid  of  effective  precipitation,  ,  is  calcu- lated as where    is  the  time  from  the  beginning  of  effective precipitation to halfway through period i. If the hye- tograph  is  imagined  to  represent  the  distribution  of masses  on  a  bar,  the  centroid  is  the  balance-point. The centroid of a response hydrograph, t , can be es- timated by approximating the continuous curve with a  histogram  and  substituting  the  appropriate  values into equation (10.13). The centroid lag, T , is defined as the time be- tween the centroids of input and response: T  – .  As  will  be  discussed  more  fully  below,  the  cen- troid  lag  is a theoretically meaningful  value  charac- terizing the response time of a watershed. However, a  more  commonly  used  measure  of  watershed  re- sponse time is the time between the centroid of input and the peak, called the centroid lag-to-peak, T It  is  commonly  assumed  that    ≈  0.60  ·  , where T  is the time of concentration, i.e., the time it  takes  water  to  travel  from  the  hydraulically  most distant  part  of  the  contributing  area  to  the  outlet. Thus T  = t . However, it is virtually impossible to  define  the  true  time  of  concentration  because  of uncertainties about the nature of the flow paths. For- mulas for estimating nominal values of T  from wa- tershed  and  storm  characteristics  are  discussed  in section 10.6. In spite of the difficulty in obtaining a precise a priori definition of time of concentration in most nat- ural  situations,  the  concept  is  useful  in  visualizing hydrologic response: If effective precipitation contin- ues at a constant rate for a duration equal to T , the outflow rate will become equal to the input rate and the  hydrograph  peak  will  be  effectively  constant  at that rate until input ceases (figure 10.13). This condi- tion  is  called  runoff,  and  the  time  at equilibrium Runoff Generation and Streamflow Figure 10.13 Schematic hydrograph for equilib- rium runoff resulting when input duration, T , exceeds the watershed’s time of equilibrium, T . which the input and output rates become effectively equal is an apparent time of concentration, called the time to equilibrium, T . When equilibrium runoff is occurring, all parts of the contributing area are con- tributing to the output, and q p t t T pk c eq P P is the peak event-flow rate [L3 T–1], p* is the  effective  water-input  rate  [L  and    is  the contributing area [L2]. Equilibrium runoff almost never occurs in natu- ral  watersheds,  but  it  can  occur  from  small  areas with  short  times  of  concentration,  such  as  parking lots. Thus most hydrographs from natural areas have an  instantaneous  peak,  as  in  figure  10.13,  and  the peak  flow  rate  will  be  less  than  the  input  rate.

This separation is crucial because it allows for the prediction of runoff response to rainfall, enabling accurate forecasting and management of water resources. The effective rainfall (P*) is the fraction of water input that appears as event flow, and understanding this component is essential for predicting the volume and timing of runoff."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed response, what is the significance of the centroid lag, and how does it relate to the time of concentration?", "answer": "The centroid lag (T) is a theoretically meaningful value characterizing the response time of a watershed, defined as the time between the centroids of input and response. It is related to the time of concentration (T), which is the time it takes water to travel from the hydraulically most distant part of the contributing area to the outlet.

However, equilibrium runoff can occur in small areas with short times of concentration, such as parking lots, where the entire contributing area can contribute runoff simultaneously, leading to a constant peak flow rate equal to the input rate."}, {"question": "How does the concept of time to equilibrium (T) relate to the hydrograph's peak and the input rate, and what implications does this have for understanding runoff generation?", "answer": "The time to equilibrium (T) is the apparent time of concentration at which the input and output rates become effectively equal, leading to a constant hydrograph peak. This concept implies that when the input duration exceeds T, the outflow rate will equal the input rate, and the hydrograph peak will remain constant until input ceases. Understanding T is crucial for predicting runoff generation, as it helps in visualizing hydrologic response and managing water resources effectively."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrograph analysis, what is the difference between the time of rise and the lag-to-peak, and how do these terms relate to the overall hydrograph shape?", "answer": "The time of rise refers to the duration of the hydrograph rise, from the beginning of the hydrograph rise to the peak flow, while the lag-to-peak (T) is the time between the beginning of input and the peak flow. These terms are related but distinct, with the time of rise being a component of the lag-to-peak. The time of rise and lag-to-peak together describe the shape of the rising limb of the hydrograph, which is crucial for understanding the runoff response to rainfall."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to define the true time of concentration in natural watersheds, and what implications does this have for hydrologic modeling and prediction?", "answer": "Defining the true time of concentration is challenging due to uncertainties about the nature of flow paths in natural watersheds. This uncertainty implies that hydrologic models and predictions must account for these complexities, using approximations or nominal values of T derived from watershed and storm characteristics. Despite these challenges, the concept of time of concentration remains useful for visualizing hydrologic response and managing water resources."}, {"question": "How does the centroid of the input hyetograph relate to the concept of effective precipitation, and what is its significance in hydrograph analysis?", "answer": "The centroid of the input hyetograph represents the weighted-average time of occurrence of the input, calculated as the balance point of the distribution of masses on a bar. This concept is significant in hydrograph analysis because it allows for the calculation of the centroid lag, which characterizes the response time of the watershed.

{"paragraph": "10.2.5 Effects of Input and Basin Characteristics on the Hydrograph: Exploration via a Simple Model The  objective  of  this  section  is  to  explore  in  a general  way  how  (1)  storm  size  and  timing  and  (2) drainage-basin  characteristics  affect  the  hydrograph Part III: Water Movement on the Land characteristics defined in table 10.2 and figure 10.12. To  do  this  we  use  the  simple linear-watershed model developed in box 10.3. This model is based on the  principle  of  conservation  of  mass  [equation (10B3.1)] and on a very simple heuristic concept of watershed  function:  the  linear-reservoir  model [equation (10B3.2)]. A  linear  watershed  is  characterized  by  a  single parameter,  T*,  called  the  time:  the  larger response the value of T*, the longer it takes water to travel to the  watershed  outlet  and  the  more  sluggish  the  re- sponse  of  the  watershed.  Thus  T*  integrates  the  ef- fects  of  all  the  factors  that  affect  the  travel  time  of water  input  to  the  basin  outlet:  permanent  condi- tions such as watershed size, shape, slope, soils, and Box 10.3 Linear-Reservoir Model of Watershed Response We can develop a very simple conceptual model of the response of a watershed to effective precipitation based on: (1) the principle of conservation of mass, (10B3.1) (section 1.6.2) and (2) the linear-reservoir conceptual model of watershed behavior (section 1.10.2): (10B3.2) that characterizes the watershed response [T]. Real watersheds are not strictly linear reservoirs, but equa- tion (10B3.2) captures the most basic aspects of water- shed response and is mathematically tractable. Combining equations (10B3.1) and (10B3.2) yields which for constant p* has the solution exp( *), (10B3.4) q* p* q p* -t T where   is the outflow at t = 0. To model an isolated hydrograph rise in response to a constant input beginning at t = 0 and lasting until time T , we can set  0  at t = 0 so that equation (10B3.4) becomes geology, and changing conditions that affect the na- ture  of  the  various  flow  paths,  such  as  vegetative cover and watershed wetness. The discussion later in this chapter of the physical processes that produce a response  hydrograph  will  provide  more  detailed  in- sight into these relationships. In the examples used here to illustrate basic hy- drograph features, the input, output, and time values are arbitrary. Thus although T* is given in “hr,” this is an arbitrary measure of watershed response time, and all times are relative. Inputs and outputs are also Inputs  to  the  model  represent  effective  water  input, and  in  all  the  simulations  examined  here  the  total volume of input, P*, is the same: 1 unit. Because the The peak discharge,  , occurs when water input ceases, i.e., when t = T ;   is then given by exp(-T )˘ (10B3.6) q p* 1- T * . When input ceases the hydrograph recession begins and we have new conditions: p* = 0 and the “initial” dis- charge is   at time t = T . Thus for the recession equa- tion (10B3.4) becomes (10B3.7) q* q expÈ T T * ,  t T . The properties of this model are: 1. The  model  preserves  continuity;  i.e.,  the  volume  of event  response  Q*  equals  the  volume  of  effective water input, P* = p* · T . 2. T*  can  be  shown  to  be  equal  to  the  centroid  lag  of 3. The hydrograph rise begins as soon as input begins (T  = 0) and peaks exactly at t  = T . 4. Because outflow decreases exponentially after input ceases  and  approaches  zero  asymptotically,  time  of concentration  is  infinite.  However,  if  we  define  the time  to  equilibrium,  T ,  as  the  time  it  takes  for  the outflow rate to reach 99% of a constant inflow rate, it can be shown that Chapter 10 model preserves continuity, the total volume of out-", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the linear-watershed model, what is the significance of the parameter T*?", "answer": "The parameter T* represents the time it takes water to travel to the watershed outlet and characterizes the watershed's response time, integrating the effects of factors such as watershed size, shape, slope, soils, and geology."}, {"question": "How does the linear-reservoir conceptual model of watershed behavior capture the basic aspects of watershed response?", "answer": "The linear-reservoir model captures the basic aspects of watershed response by combining the principle of conservation of mass and a simple heuristic concept of watershed function, allowing for a mathematically tractable representation of the watershed's response to effective precipitation.

However, by defining a time to equilibrium (T) as the time it takes for the outflow rate to reach 99% of a constant inflow rate, it's possible to provide a more practical measure of the time it takes for the watershed to respond to changes in input.

{"paragraph": "10.2.5.2 Response Time and Centroid Lag As noted earlier, T* is related to the time required for water to travel to the watershed outlet, so that its value is determined largely by the following factors: Size:  Larger  watersheds  have  larger Watershed T*, other things equal. Analyses of large floods by Holtan  and  Overton  (1963)  indicated  that  T*  is strongly related to drainage area; however, the re- lationship  varies  from  region  to  region,  presum- ably  largely  because  of  differences  in  watershed geology, soils, and topography. Geology:  Water  moves  fastest  toward Soils  and streams as overland flow and slowest as subsurface flow (as discussed more fully later in this chapter). Thus  watersheds  with  low  surface  hydraulic  con- ductivities  (e.g.,  clay  soils),  where  less  infiltration and  more  overland  flow  occur,  should  have smaller  T*  than  those  with  higher  conductivities (e.g., sandy soils). If flow paths are predominantly in the subsurface, watersheds with higher hydrau- lic conductivities will have smaller values of T*. Slope:  Steeper  slopes  should  be  associated  with faster surface and subsurface water movement and hence smaller T*. Land Use: In general, watersheds with heavy vege- tation,  especially  forests,  have  permeable  surface soils  that  allow  rapid  infiltration  and  subsurface flow to streams, resulting in larger T*. In contrast, sparsely  vegetated  watersheds  tend  to  have  lower T* because their lower surface permeability makes Figure 10.16 Response, q*, of linear watershed with T* = 5 hr to 1 unit of input, P*, in 1 hr. Input rate p* = 1 unit/hr. overland flow more common. Watersheds with in- tensive urbanization (more impermeable areas and storm  sewers)  generally  have  faster  water  move- ment and smaller T*. Watershed Wetness: As seen in section 10.2.3.2, the wetness  of  the  watershed  at  the  time  of  a  rainfall event (antecedent condition) usually has a significant influence on the connectivity of surface and subsur- face  flow  paths  and  the  extent  of  the  contributing area, so that a given watershed will have a smaller T* when  wet  than  when  drier.  The  physical  relations underlying this are discussed in section 10.4. In  the  linear-watershed  model  the  centroid  lag, , is equal to T*, regardless of the timing of inputs. Thus if the timing and amounts of effective water in- put  and  output  can  be  determined,  average would  appear  to  be  the  best  estimate  of  the  charac- teristic response time for a given watershed.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of watershed size, how does the value of T* change with larger watersheds?", "answer": "Larger watersheds have larger T*, other things being equal, because the time required for water to travel to the watershed outlet increases with size."}, {"question": "Why does the relationship between T* and drainage area vary from region to region?", "answer": "The relationship between T* and drainage area varies from region to region largely because of differences in watershed geology, soils, and topography, which affect how water moves through the watershed."}, {"question": "In the context of water movement, how does the type of soil affect the value of T*?", "answer": "The type of soil affects T* because water moves fastest as overland flow and slowest as subsurface flow. Watersheds with low surface hydraulic conductivities, such as clay soils, have smaller T* due to less infiltration and more overland flow, whereas those with higher conductivities, like sandy soils, have smaller T* if flow paths are predominantly in the subsurface."}, {"question": "What is the impact of land use on the value of T*, and why does this occur?", "answer": "Land use impacts T* significantly. Watersheds with heavy vegetation, especially forests, tend to have larger T* because the permeable surface soils allow for rapid infiltration and subsurface flow to streams. In contrast, sparsely vegetated watersheds and those with intensive urbanization have smaller T* due to lower surface permeability and more impermeable areas, which make overland flow more common and water movement faster."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed wetness, how does the antecedent condition affect the value of T*?", "answer": "The wetness of the watershed at the time of a rainfall event, or antecedent condition, affects T* by influencing the connectivity of surface and subsurface flow paths and the extent of the contributing area. A given watershed will have a smaller T* when wet than when drier because the physical relations underlying this influence the timing and amounts of effective water input and output."}, {"question": "How does the centroid lag relate to T* in the linear-watershed model, and what implications does this have for estimating characteristic response time?", "answer": "In the linear-watershed model, the centroid lag is equal to T*, regardless of the timing of inputs. This means that if the timing and amounts of effective water input and output can be determined, the average centroid lag would appear to be the best estimate of the characteristic response time for a given watershed. This relationship simplifies the estimation of response time by equating it directly with the centroid lag, providing a straightforward method for hydrological analysis. However, it also implies that the accuracy of this estimation depends on accurately determining the inputs and outputs, which can be challenging due to the complexities of watershed hydrology."}, {"question": "Why do watersheds with steeper slopes tend to have smaller T* values?", "answer": "Watersheds with steeper slopes have smaller T* values because steeper slopes are associated with faster surface and subsurface water movement. This faster movement reduces the time required for water to travel to the watershed outlet, resulting in smaller T* values."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what are the implications of the relationship between T* and watershed characteristics for predicting flood responses?", "answer": "The relationship between T* and watershed characteristics has significant implications for predicting flood responses. Understanding how factors such as size, geology, soils, slope, land use, and wetness condition affect T* can help in predicting how a watershed will respond to rainfall events. This knowledge can be used to improve flood forecasting models by incorporating the specific characteristics of the watershed, thereby enhancing the accuracy of flood predictions and contributing to better water resource management. However, the variability in these relationships across different regions and the complexity of watershed hydrology pose challenges that must be addressed in model development and application."}, {"question": "How does intensive urbanization affect water movement and T* in a watershed?", "answer": "Intensive urbanization generally results in faster water movement and smaller T* in a watershed. This is because urbanization leads to more impermeable areas and the presence of storm sewers, which increase the likelihood of overland flow and reduce the time water takes to reach the watershed outlet."}, {"question": "In the context of watershed hydrology, what role does the connectivity of surface and subsurface flow paths play in determining T*?", "answer": "The connectivity of surface and subsurface flow paths plays a crucial role in determining T* by influencing how water moves through the watershed. The extent to which these paths are connected affects the speed at which water can travel to the outlet, with more connected paths generally leading to faster movement and smaller T* values. The antecedent moisture condition of the watershed is a key factor influencing this connectivity, highlighting the importance of considering watershed wetness in hydrological analyses."}]}

Understanding these factors is essential for predicting and managing watershed responses to various water inputs."}, {"question": "How does the average travel time to the basin outlet affect the response time in real watersheds?", "answer": "The average travel time to the basin outlet adds to the time required to fill storage, thereby increasing the response time in real watersheds compared to the linear-watershed model. This travel time is significant because it accounts for the physical distance water must travel through the watershed, which can vary greatly depending on the watershed's size, shape, and topography. As a result, understanding and accurately estimating this travel time is critical for modeling and predicting watershed responses."}, {"question": "In what conditions can the channelward flow of \"old\" water occur, and what are the implications for watershed response?", "answer": "The channelward flow of \"old\" water can occur when water inputs cause a nearly immediate change in hydraulic conditions. This condition implies that the watershed can respond quickly under certain circumstances, potentially leading to rapid increases in stream flow. The implications of this phenomenon include the need for detailed understanding and modeling of soil storage and hydraulic conditions near streams to accurately predict watershed responses, especially in scenarios where rapid changes in stream flow are critical, such as in flood forecasting and water resource management."}, {"question": "Why is understanding the time required to fill storage important for watershed management?", "answer": "Understanding the time required to fill storage is important because it directly influences the watershed's response time to water inputs. Accurate knowledge of this time is crucial for predicting how a watershed will respond to rainfall or other water inputs, which in turn is essential for managing water resources effectively, including flood control, water supply management, and ecosystem health maintenance. Misjudging this time can lead to inadequate preparation for extreme events or inefficient use of water resources."}, {"question": "How does the linear-watershed model simplify the representation of watershed response compared to real watersheds?", "answer": "The linear-watershed model simplifies the representation of watershed response by assuming that the response begins as soon as the input begins, without accounting for the time required to fill storage or the average travel time to the basin outlet. This simplification makes the model less complex but also less accurate for representing the nuanced behaviors of real watersheds, where these factors play significant roles in determining the response time and characteristics."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what are the implications of neglecting the time required to fill storage and travel time in watershed response models?", "answer": "Neglecting the time required to fill storage and travel time in watershed response models can lead to inaccurate predictions of watershed response, particularly in terms of the timing and magnitude of stream flow. This inaccuracy can have significant implications for water resource management, including inadequate preparation for floods, inefficient allocation of water resources, and poor maintenance of ecosystem health. Therefore, incorporating these factors into hydrological models is essential for improving their accuracy and usefulness in real-world applications."}, {"question": "Why is it challenging to model the response of real watersheds accurately?", "answer": "Modeling the response of real watersheds accurately is challenging because it involves accounting for various complex factors such as the time required to fill storage (including canopy interception, infiltration, and surface depressions) and the average travel time to the basin outlet. Additionally, the phenomenon of \"old\" water being mobilized quickly under certain hydraulic conditions adds another layer of complexity. These factors vary greatly between different watersheds and can change over time, making it difficult to develop models that accurately capture"}]}

In contrast, a larger T* (e.g., T* = 5 hr) results in a lower peak (about 20% of the input rate) and a much slower recession, with outflow still above zero 7 hr after input stops.

{"paragraph": "10.3 Identification of Runoff Sources The actual sources of streamflow can be identi- fied with confidence only if water entering the stream from specific sources (e.g., direct rain onto the chan- nel, flow from the watershed surface, ground water) has  a  characteristic  water-quality  “signature”  and  if the  components  of  this  signature  in  streamflow  are monitored  during  an  event.  The  basic  approach  to this  problem  is  mixing end-member  analysis (EMMA);  this  involves  (1)  identifying  two  or  more streamflow  sources  (end  members);  (2)  characteriz- ing the unique chemical or isotopic characteristics of each end member; (3) measuring the concentrations of  those  characteristic  components  in  streamflow; and (4) using mathematical analysis to determine the proportion of each end member present. The analysis is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  characteristic components  are  “conservative”;  i.e.,  that  their  con- centrations are affected only by mixing in the stream, and  not  by  chemical  reactions  or  isotopic  fraction- ation while en route to the point of measurement. The  simplest  case  involves  two  end  members (e.g.,  surface  flow  and  ground  water),  each  with  a characteristic concentration of a particular constitu- ent. In this case we can write the mass-balance equa- tion for water as and for the constituent as where  the  cs  represent  the  characteristic  concentra- tions,  the  qs  represent  discharges,  the  subscripts  de- note the two components, and (t) denotes variability with  time.  Then  if  the  total  flow  rate,  q(t),  and  its concentration,  c(t),  are  measured,  we  can  combine equations  (10.18)  and  (10.19)  to  calculate  the  dis- charge contributed by each component: (10.20a) Runoff Generation and Streamflow (10.20b) Contributions of three end members can be de- termined  if  one  can  measure  the  flow  rate  contrib- uted  by  one  of  them,  as  well  as  the  total  flow  rate and total concentration. For example, Swistock et al. (1989) used rainfall measurements to determine the contribution  of  precipitation  directly  on  a  channel, (t),  and  were  able  to  determine  the  contributions gw cp gw (t (t (t (10.21a) s gw s gw (10.21b) where the subscripts cp, s, and gw denote channel pre- cipitation,  soil,  and  ground  water,  respectively,  and 18O was the tracer. The  most  commonly  used  chemical  tracers  are ity, and the stable isotopes 18O and 2H. Very precise measurements  of  concentrations  are  usually  needed to  get  meaningful  hydrograph  separations  because small errors in concentrations can lead to large errors in computed flow rates (Rice and Hornberger 1998). Because a given tracer is seldom strictly conserva- tive, one can solve the above equations using several tracers,  and  construct  a  composite  curve.  For  exam- ple, Pinder and Jones (1969) applied equation (10.20) using  HCO ,  Mg,  Ca,  and  SO   as  tracers,  and  con- structed  a  composite  curve  showing  ground-water contribution on a small watershed in Canada (figure 10.19).  Interestingly,  the  analysis  indicated  that ground  water  contributed  significantly  to  the  peak discharge  (compare  figure  10.19  with  figure  9.34). Figure 10.20 shows an example of EMMA for a small watershed in Georgia, where the sources are ground water (sampled via wells), the surface organic layer of the soil (sampled via a suction lysimeter), and water draining  from  the  hillslopes  (sampled  via  a  shallow well  at  the  hillslope  base);  the  constituents  are  silica (SiO ) and magnesium (Mg). (Similar diagrams were constructed  using  other  constituents.)  Note  that  the points  outside  the  triangle  do  not  fit  the  EMMA model using these constituents; this could be because (1) the compositions are not strictly conservative (i.e., chemical reactions may alter the water chemistry); (2) the end members are not correctly characterized due to  inadequate  sampling;  or  (3)  there  are  unsampled streamflow sources. However, the percentage of varia- Part III: Water Movement on the Land tion  in  the  streamwater  solute  concentrations  ex- plained by the analysis ranged from 82 to > 97%, and the hydrograph separation was physically reasonable. Figure 10.21 is a Stiff diagram that shows end- member  chemical  compositions  in  an  alpine  water- shed  in  Colorado.  Chemical  analyses  of  runoff  on this  watershed  indicate  that  long-residence-time ground water is an important component of stream- flow, becoming more important as watershed size in- creases (Frisbee et al. 2011).

However, this method still provides a useful tool for estimating the contribution of channel precipitation to the overall hydrograph."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrological modeling, what are the challenges of accurately estimating channel precipitation?", "answer": "Accurately estimating channel precipitation poses several challenges, including the need for precise measurements of stream channel surface area and total rainfall. Additionally, the approximation of the hydrograph as a triangle may introduce errors in the calculated peak discharge from channel precipitation.

This combination of high rainfall intensity and low surface conductivity leads to the conditions necessary for Hortonian overland flow to occur, namely, the water-input rate exceeding the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface. Additionally, the lack of vegetation in these regions reduces the ability of the soil to absorb water, further contributing to the likelihood of Hortonian overland flow."}, {"question": "In what types of areas is Hortonian overland flow more likely to occur, and why?", "answer": "Hortonian overland flow is more likely to occur in areas where soil frost or human or animal activity has reduced surface conductivity, and in impermeable areas. This is because these conditions reduce the soil's ability to absorb water, making it more likely for the water-input rate to exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity, thus leading to Hortonian overland flow. Furthermore, in impermeable areas, the water has no choice but to run off the surface, as the soil cannot absorb it, directly contributing to Hortonian overland flow."}, {"question": "How does the concept of the \"time of ponding\" relate to Hortonian overland flow, and what factors influence this time?", "answer": "The \"time of ponding\" is the instant when surface saturation occurs, marking the beginning of Hortonian overland flow. This time is influenced by factors such as the soil's saturated hydraulic conductivity, capillary suction at the wetting front, and antecedent soil wetness (i.e., porosity less initial water content). Understanding the time of ponding is crucial because it determines when Hortonian overland flow will start, and its calculation can be based on these factors for a constant input rate."}, {"question": "Why did Betson modify Horton's view on the occurrence of overland flow due to saturation from above?", "answer": "Betson modified Horton's view by proposing the partial-area concept, suggesting that overland flow due to saturation from above (Hortonian overland flow) may not occur from virtually an entire upland watershed as Horton postulated. Instead, Betson found that event response may originate as Hortonian overland flow on a limited, low-permeability contributing area that varies from watershed to watershed but remains fairly constant on a given watershed.

This increase in hydraulic conductivity makes it less likely for the water-input rate to exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity, thus reducing the likelihood of Hortonian overland flow. As a result, actual occurrences of Hortonian overland flow may be even rarer than implied by comparisons of rainfall intensities with saturated hydraulic conductivities of mineral soil horizons."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between rainfall intensity and the occurrence of Hortonian overland flow, and how does this relate to soil types?", "answer": "The relationship between rainfall intensity and the occurrence of Hortonian overland flow is that Hortonian overland flow tends to occur with relatively intense rains on relatively fine-grained soils. This is because fine-grained soils have lower saturated hydraulic conductivities, making it more likely for the rainfall intensity to exceed this conductivity, leading to Hortonian overland flow. However, the presence of organic matter and biological activity in surface horizons can alter this relationship by increasing the hydraulic conductivity of these soils, thus affecting the likelihood of Hortonian overland flow."}]}

Near-stream saturated zones will be most exten- sive in drainage basins with concave hillslope profiles and wide, flat valleys.

The flow direction is normal to the total-head contours; thus initial infiltration is nor- mal  to  the  slope,  but  becomes  nearly  vertical  if  the event continues long enough. These simulations indi- cate  that  significant  downslope  Darcian  unsaturated flow does not occur during a storm or snowmelt event. Thus Darcian unsaturated flow does not appear to be a likely source of water to near-stream saturated zones during water-input events under most circumstances. Part III: Water Movement on the Land However, the study by Jackson (1992) and others show  that  a  downslope  component  of  drainage  can emerge following a water-input event on deep homoge- neous soils. After water input ceases, the near-surface head contours continue to rotate clockwise, ultimately becoming nearly normal to the surface (figure 10.31c, d), indicating downslope flow.

{"paragraph": "10.4.3.1.2 Macropores and Preferential Flow The simulations and experiments just described suggest that unsaturated Darcian flow through a ho- mogeneous,  isotropic  soil  matrix  is  seldom,  if  ever, rapid  enough  to  link  infiltrated  water  directly  to event  flow  (Buttle  and  McDonald  2002).  However, natural  soils  are  not  generally  homogeneous  or  iso- tropic:  biological  activity  (root  growth  and  decay Part III: Water Movement on the Land and  burrowing  animals),  desiccation,  and  frost  ac- tion  commonly  occur  near  the  surface  to  produce macropores (also called soil pipes), which are larger than the pores of the undisturbed soil matrix (figure 10.34).  Flow  through  macropores  is  usually  much more  rapid  than  unsaturated  or  saturated  Darcian flow  through  the  soil  matrix  (Kirkby  1988),  and  is called preferential flow or bypass flow. Macropores can conduct water downslope considerable distances through  otherwise  unsaturated  soils  at  velocities  of several  millimeters  per  second  (Mosley  1979,  1982; Beven and Germann 1982, 2013). Macropores  are  typically  on  the  order  of  3  to 100 mm in diameter and are interconnected to vary- ing  degrees  (figure  10.34).  They  typically  occur  in the  upper  soil  layers  (the  solum  in  figure  2.46),  but may  link  to  openings  at  depth  that  can  extend  over tens or hundreds of meters in fractured rock. In a de- Figure 10.33 (a) Water content and (b) hydraulic-head distribution in a sloping slab after 749 hr of drainage. Slope = 15°. Note the saturated wedge at the slope base [Nutter (1975)]. tailed  study  in  a  New  Hampshire  forest,  Stresky (1991) found that more than 60% of the macropores were  in  the  upper  0.15  m  of  the  soil,  and  were  cre- ated  by  live  roots,  decayed  roots,  and  animal  bur- rows. More than 70% of them were less than 20 mm in  diameter—though  conduits  exceeding  25  mm were  present.  Macropore  networks  were  generally oriented  downslope  and  were  interconnected  over distances of at least tens of meters. The  soil  matrix  surrounding  the  macropores  is often  unsaturated,  so  the  potential  gradient  causing preferential flow is not in equilibrium with the gradi- ent in the soil matrix. For example, Beven and Ger- mann  (2013)  reported  that  preferential  flow  can occur regardless of the antecedent soil-water content, and  cited  experiments  in  which  95%  of  infiltration occurred in pores wider than 0.25 mm, which consti- tuted  less  than  0.5%  of pore  volume.  Kirkby  (1988) Chapter 10 presented  a  general  relation  between  the  minimum pore diameter that will cause bypassing and the pore (grain) size of the soil matrix (figure 10.35): In a clay soil (0.0001 mm), a pore of 0.1-mm diameter will act as  a  macropore;  in  a  sand  of  0.5-mm  diameter,  the minimum macropore size is about 1 mm. As noted by Ward (1984, p. 181), the functioning of a thatched roof  provides  an  apt  analogy  for  the  functioning  of preferential flow paths provided by macropores in an unsaturated matrix: No hydrologist, having measured the infiltration characteristics of bundles of straw, would recom- Figure 10.34 Macropores in an approximately 1-m portion of hillslope in a New Hampshire forest floor. Live-root and organic macropores are indicated; other macropores are decayed roots. For live-root macropores, the entire root is shown; flow occurs in the space between the roots and the soil matrix. Dark portions show tracer-dye paths [Stresky (1991)]. Runoff Generation and Streamflow mend their use as roofing material. And yet, in even the heaviest rain, the building remains dry, no water runs over the thatch as “overland” flow, there is no “ground water” and no evidence of zones of “tem- porary saturation,” i.e. all the rainfall is evacuated along the narrow layer of the thatch itself. The thatched roof works because the alignment of straw imparts a preferential permeability along the stems and because the roof slopes. Networks  of  visible  macropores  are  often  dis- connected  (figure  10.34),  so  continuous  downslope flows require some mechanism for transmitting flow Part III: Water Movement on the Land Figure 10.35 Relation between critical minimum macropore diameter that will allow bypassing and pore exceeding about 1 mm diameter [reproduced from Kirkby (1988), Hillslope runoff processes and models, Journal of Hydrology 100:315–339, with permission from Elsevier]. from one part of the network to another. Where the soil is saturated, this happens via the propagation of pressure waves, such that an increase in pressure in an  upslope  macropore  causes  the  displacement  of stored water into a pathway farther downslope. This can also be a mechanism for the displacement of wa- ter from the matrix into an empty macropore (Beven and Germann 2013). Preferential  flows have been  documented  in nu- merous  environments  from  the  Amazon  to  Alaska, and  are  often  an  important  part  of  hillslope  runoff generation  and,  by  implication,  important  in  solute transport  (Chappell  2010;  Jones  2010;  Beven  and Germann 2013). Macropore flow has been found to contribute to event flow in northern Quebec (Roberge and  Plamondon  1987),  New  Zealand  (McDonnell holth  et  al.  1998),  New  Mexico  (Newman  et  al. 1998), and in the humid tropics (Jones 2010). An en- tire  issue  of  Processes  (volume  24,  issue Hydrological 12, 2010) was devoted to preferential flows. It is clear from these studies that macropores play an important role in delivering water input to streams in many re- gions,  particularly  forested  areas;  in  some  places, preferential flows may contribute up to 50% of event flow  (Jones  2010).  Many  studies  indicate  that  their importance  increases  with  the  amount  of  rain  or snowmelt in an event. Because the number, orientation, size, and inter- connectedness  of  macropores  are  highly  dependent on  local  geology,  soils,  vegetation,  and  fauna,  it  is difficult  to  generalize  about  their  importance  or  to simulate  their  effects  in  models.  Ward’s  thatched- roof  analogy  emphasizes  the  contrast  between  pref- erential-flow processes and the traditional modeling of  infiltration  as  an  equilibrium  process  through  a soil  matrix  via  Darcy’s  law  and  the  Richards  equa- tion, as in section 7.4.7. Recognizing this, Beven and Germann (2013, p. 8) argued that the widespread use of the Richards equation as a basis for modeling hill- slope  hydrologic  response  is  inappropriate,  and called for a new approach that includes “the interac- tion between input variability, surface characteristics, antecedent conditions, and the generation of prefer- ential  flow  in  ways  that  reflect  the  (non-Richards) dynamics of . . . flow in a heterogeneous matrix. . . .” Attempts to model preferential flow have been made by  Ormsbee  and  Khan  (1989),  Jones  and  Connelly (see Beven and Germann 2013).

{"paragraph": "10.4.3.2.2 Flow from Shallow Saturated Layers (The Sloping Slab) In many regions, hillslopes consist of a thin layer of  permeable  soil  overlying  relatively  impermeable materials, or soils in which the hydraulic conductiv- ity  decreases  markedly  with  depth.  In  these  situa- tions,  infiltration  and  percolation  of  water  input commonly produce a thin saturated zone that is not connected  to  a  regional  ground-water  flow  (i.e.,  a perched  table),  and  downslope  flow  in  this zone can contribute to event response. This situation is often referred to as a sloping slab. The time required for a saturated layer to begin forming in a sloping slab can be estimated by apply- ing  the  same  reasoning  used  to  develop  the  Green- and-Ampt approach to modeling infiltration in shal- low  soils  (section  8.4.3.6).  We  consider  an  initially unsaturated  soil  layer  of  uniform  depth,  hydraulic properties, and initial water content overlying a uni- formly sloping impermeable base (figure 10.38 on p. 495). For these conditions, the time, T , required for a wetting front due to the complete infiltration of in- put  at  a  constant  water-input  rate,  p,  to  reach  the base can be determined from equation (8.47): is the soil-water content at which the hydrau- lic conductivity equals p, θ is initial water content, Y is soil depth, β is the slope angle, and the cosine accounts for  the  fact  that  infiltration  is  vertical.

Box 10.4 Hydraulics of Sloping-Slab Flow Beven (1981) explored hydraulic relations for sloping- slab flows, based on earlier work by Dupuit and Hender- son and Wooding (1964). The flow geometry is shown in figure 10.38. Basic Equations Darcy’s law is -K , (10B4.1) is hydraulic conductivity [L T–1]. The one- head [L], and K dimensional conservation-of-mass (continuity) relation is (10B4.2) ∂t ∂x cosb where y(x,t) is height of water table above the bed, S is flow rate per unit width [L2 T–1], and p is input rate per unit horizontal area [L T–1]. To formulate the various flow representations, equa- tion (10B4.1) is integrated over the saturated depth and substituted into equation (10B4.2), incorporating vari- ous assumptions about the flow paths and hydraulic gradient, as shown below.

They were applied to a horizontal aquifer in boxes 8.3 and 8.4.

Equilibrium Runoff If  input  continues  for  a  period  exceeding  the time  of  concentration  (the  time  it  takes  water  from the most distant part of the slope to travel to the out- let),  the  flow  rate  becomes  constant  and  we  have equilibrium  runoff  (figure  10.13).

This is because macropores provide preferential flow paths for water, allowing it to bypass the soil matrix and move quickly through the slab. As a result, models that account for both macropore and Darcian matrix flow, such as the one developed by Ormsbee and Khan, are necessary to accurately predict runoff from sloping slabs containing macropores.

Under these conditions, the flow becomes more complex, and the Dupuit-Forchheimer equations or extended Dupuit-Forchheimer equations are required to accurately model the runoff.

They were able to identify 11  runoff  sources:  precipitation,  throughfall,  stem- flow,  litter  leachate,  wetland  soil  water,  soil  water, shallow  ground  water,  ground-water  seeps,  hypo- rheic (subchannel) water, riparian ground water, and deep  ground  water.  Base-flow  chemistry  of  stream waters was similar to ground-water seeps. Event run- off  was  attributed  to  contributions  from  surficial sources (precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and lit- ter  leachate)  on  the  rising  limb  of  the  hydrograph and to soil and shallow ground-water sources on the recession limb. As shown in figure 10.41 on p. 501, the shapes of the storm-event hysteresis loops (wide versus tight, quasi-linear patterns) varied with hydro- logic  conditions  from  wet,  hydrologically  well-con- nected conditions to a dry, disconnected state.

In contrast, saturation overland flow occurs when the soil is saturated, and the water table is near the surface, often in valley bottoms or areas with low to high permeability.

For instance, steep slopes with high surface permeability favor Hortonian overland flow, while gentle slopes with low permeability favor saturation overland flow. The diagram also shows that the transition from subsurface storm flow to saturation overland flow is largely controlled by rainfall depth, and the occurrence of Hortonian overland flow is largely controlled by rainfall intensity. This is because the relative rates of rainfall, infiltration, lateral flow convergence, and storage dynamics within variably saturated soil layers define the processes by which runoff begins and ends."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the study by Mirus and Loague (2013) in understanding watershed processes, and how does it relate to the Dunne diagram?", "answer": "The study by Mirus and Loague (2013) provides deeper insight into watershed processes by quantitatively exploring the concepts of the Dunne diagram.

The competition between these mechanisms has implications for watershed management, as it affects the timing and magnitude of runoff response.

These changes can result in modifications to the hydrograph's shape, peak flows, and timing, making it essential to accurately account for them in hydrologic modeling and prediction.

However,  the  relation  between  flow  velocity and flood-wave velocity may be altered when a flood overtops the channel banks and inundates the flood- plain.  Typically  the  velocities  of  the  overbank  por- tions of a flow are much lower than in-channel flows because  they  are  shallower  and  encounter  much higher resistance due to vegetation.

{"paragraph": "10.5.2 Simple Streamflow Routing Streamflow routing is the computational proce- dure  for  modeling  the  modification  of  hydrographs traveling  through  the  stream  network.  The hydrograph at the downstream end of a stream seg- ment (“reach”) is predicted, given an inflow hydro- graph  for  the  upstream  end  of  the  reach,  the hydraulic characteristics of the reach, and a lateral- inflow hydrograph. The most general approaches to this  problem  are  based  directly  on  discretization  of equations  (10.41)  and  (10.42).  However,  such  ap- proaches are generally time-consuming and data-in- tensive,  and  engineers  have  developed  simpler routing  methods  that  can  usefully  model  the  move- ment of flood waves under many conditions. In order to get a basic understanding of the hydraulic factors that affect response hydrographs, we explore the sim- plest of these methods. Gupta et al. (1979), Weinman and  Laurenson  (1979),  and  Nwaogazie  and  Tyagi (1984) discussed more elaborate routing methods. The convex routing method is based on very sim- plified versions of equations (10.41) and (10.42) applied to  a  stream  reach  of  a  specified  length  (X),  constant of inflow at the upstream end of the reach, QI(t), as a function  of  time,  t,  is  also  specified.  (A  lateral-inflow hydrograph  may  be  specified  as  well.)  The  conserva- tion-of-mass relation is written in discrete form as is the rate of outflow from the reach at time where QO t, V  is the volume of water stored in the reach at time + Δt. The dynamic relation of equation t, and t = t (10.42) is written for the outflow in very simple form: where  T*  is  the  time  it  takes  a  flood  wave  to  travel through the reach, i.e., where U can be estimated from the reach properties propriate, (10.49). Runoff Generation and Streamflow Equation  (10.52)  portrays  the  reach  as  a reservoir,  as  was  done  for  the  watershed  model  of box 10.3. Real stream reaches are not strictly linear reservoirs, but equation (10.52) captures the most ba- sic  aspects  of  the  storage-outflow  relation  and  is mathematically tractable. The model is implemented by  selecting  the  step,  ≤  T*,  which routing  time defines a routing coefficient, CX, where Substitution of equation (10.53) into (10.52) yields and incorporating (10.54) and solving for QO  gives the routing equation: Note that an initial value, QO , must be specified. The  value  of  CX  determines  the  degree  to  which flow through the reach reduces and delays the peak (fig- ure 10.45a): If CX = 1, the outflow at the end of a time step equals the inflow at the end of the preceding step, and the flood wave travels through the reach at the ve- locity U but does not change shape during transit. Such motion  is  called  translatory.

The trade-off between simplicity and accuracy is crucial, as more complex methods may provide more accurate results but require more extensive data and computational resources.

The conservation-of-mass relation ensures that the volume of water stored in the reach is accurately accounted for, while the dynamic relation provides a simplified representation of the outflow from the reach. By combining these two relations, the convex routing method can simulate the movement of the flood wave through the reach and predict the outflow hydrograph at the downstream end. The method's ability to capture the basic aspects of the storage-outflow relation makes it a useful tool for modeling streamflow routing under various conditions."}, {"question": "What are the limitations of the convex routing method in terms of its representation of real stream reaches?", "answer": "The convex routing method represents real stream reaches as linear reservoirs, which is a simplification of the actual complex behavior of stream reaches.

Part III: Water Movement on the Land ter moves from the  land surface to and through the stream network: interception, infiltration, subsurface and  overland  flow,  and  channel  flow.  This  is  espe- cially important for predicting streamflow responses under conditions other than those for which we have recorded  experience,  including:  (1)  extreme  flood- producing rainfalls; (2) major land-use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization; and (3) altered cli- matic regimes. The  most  general  methodology  for  incorporat- ing the basic physics of hydrologic processes in mod- eling  event  response  is  to  use  spatially  distributed numerical  solutions  to  complete  equations  of  satu- rated-unsaturated subsurface and open-channel flow, as  was  done  by  Freeze  (1972a,  1972b,  1974).  How- ever, that approach is too computationally intensive and requires too much field data to be a practical ap- proach  to  runoff  modeling.  Furthermore,  questions have been raised as to whether the physical equations that describe these processes at the “micro” level are applicable  at  the  larger  scales  that  must  be  used  in modeling (e.g., Kirchner 2009; see appendix F). More practical but still physically based models commonly  represent  a  watershed  as  a  collection  of hillslope  strips  on  which  simplified  representations of  the  appropriate  mechanisms  operate—for  exam- ple, the kinematic-wave model of overland flow (Ea- gleson 1970; Stephenson and Meadows 1986) or the sloping-slab/saturated overland flow model (section 10.4.2.1;  boxes  10.4  and  10.5).  And,  as  discussed earlier, a newer generation of event models incorpo- rates saturation overland flow on variable source ar- eas whose extent depends on basin topography and watershed  wetness  through  the  TOPMODEL  ap- proach  (section  10.4.2.2)  (Hornberger  et  al.  1985; Wood et al. 1990). The coupling of such models with remotely  sensed  data  and  geographic  information systems is a growing area of research. The understanding of the physical mechanisms of runoff response developed earlier in this chapter can be applied to guide the development and application of  RF-RO  models,  even  when  the detailed  processes are not explicitly simulated. In general, the processes with the longest residence times control the shape of the hydrograph, and Kirkby (1988) suggested that sat- isfactory event models can be developed considering only  the  two  processes  with  the  longest  residence times  on  the  watershed  of  interest  (table  10.7).  Fol- lowing  Woods  and  Sivapalan  (1999),  the  residence time for watershed runoff for a given event, T , can be expressed as the sum of the residence times of wa- Table 10.7 Ranges of Residence Times Associated with Event-Response Processes on Hillslopes and in Channels.

RQ RP RH RS can  be  approximated  as  one-half  the  storm duration, T , and T  as where A  is drainage area and u  is the average flow velocity in the stream network. For rough estimates can be taken as ~1 m/s; if the appropriate infor- mation is available more refined estimates can be ob- tained via equations (10.43b) and (10.44). Hillslope residence times might be estimated us- ing knowledge of local topography and geology and the  operative  runoff  mechanism.  For  example,  for runoff due to subsurface flow in a sloping slab, where D is drainage density (section 10.1.3) and u  is the  typical  flow  velocity.    could  be  calculated  by approximating Darcy’s law as · tan(β), Chapter 10 is hydraulic conductivity and β is the slope angle,  as  was  done  in  the  kinematic-wave  approxi- mation of sloping-slab runoff (boxes 10.4 and 10.5). Figure  10.46  shows  the  ranges  of  lag-to-peak times  and  peak  flow  rates  measured  in  field  studies for watersheds in which responses were due to Hor- tonian  overland  flow,  saturation  overland  flow,  and “throughflow.” The exact nature of the throughflow represented in the data is not clear; it probably refers largely  to  macropore-dominated  flow  in  sloping slabs, but may include other subsurface mechanisms as well (section 10.4.3). Clearly, overland flow results in lag times an order of magnitude shorter and peak flows at least an order of magnitude larger than does subsurface flow. Channel hydraulics significantly af- fects  the  peaks  and  lag  times  for  watersheds  larger than  a  few  tens  of  square  kilometers.  Thus  a  small Figure 10.46 Ranges of (a) lag-to-peak and (b) peak flow rates associated with various response mechanisms. “Throughflow” probably includes all subsurface mecha- nisms in table 10.4 except ground-water mounding [reproduced from Kirkby (1988), Hillslope runoff pro- cesses and models, Journal of Hydrology 100:315–339, with permission from Elsevier]. Runoff Generation and Streamflow watershed might be efficiently modeled by taking ac- count  of  infiltration,  percolation,  and  the  appropri- ate  hillslope  process.  For  a  larger  watershed,  the response  model  might  be  simplified  to  include  only the  dominant  hillslope  process  combined  with  a channel-routing procedure. The  work  of  Wood  et  al.  (1990)  indicates  that actual patterns of soil and water-input variability do not have to be modeled for regions less than about 1 km2 in area; instead the spatial variability can be ac- counted  for  more  simply  through  the  areal  means and  variances  of  those  quantities.  And,  because channel processes tend to dominate the response hy- drographs of larger watersheds, much of the variabil- ity  and  nonlinearity  of  hillslope  event-response mechanisms can be ignored or averaged when mod- eling  watersheds  over  about  100  in  area.

{"paragraph": "10.6.2 The Watershed as an Impulse-Response System Even simulation models that simplify the runoff process as just described require the specification of many parameters characterizing watershed topogra- and  channel  configuration  (network  properties,  ge- ometry, slope, resistance), as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall. As discussed in ap- pendix  F,  none  of  these  parameters  can  be  known with certainty, so that appropriate values must be de- termined via calibration and validation: Calibration involves use of measured rainfall data as model input, comparison of model outputs with measured streamflow using different sets of parameter values, and selection of the parameter values that give the “best” model performance. Once a parameter set has been selected, validation involves comparing model outputs with measured flows for events not used in calibration. Although this methodology would seem to be a straightforward approach to determining appropriate parameter  sets,  experience  has  shown  that  signifi- cantly differing sets of parameters often give equally good  (or  bad!)  results.  This  outcome,  known  as  the problem of equifinality, severely reduces confidence in  the  validity  of  multi-parameter  models  and  pro- vides justification for viewing a watershed as a sim- ple system, or “black box,” that produces a response (the  streamflow  hydrograph)  in  response  to  an  im- pulse (the rainfall hyetograph), without detailed con- sideration of the physical processes that produce that response.

{"paragraph": "10.6.3.1.1 Prediction of Design Floods A design flood is a flood of a specified probability of occurrence that is used in the design of culverts, bridges, flood-retention basins, levees, dam spillways, or floodplain-management plans. For these situations, the goal is to estimate the design flood  using an appropriate  design rainfall as the  in- put. The design-flood probability is specified as a re- turn  period  (also  called  recurrence  interval);  this term  is  defined  in  section  4.4.3.3  and  section  C.5. The  design  return  period  depends  on  the  conse- quences  of  the  design  flood  being  exceeded:  small culverts may be designed to pass a low return-period flood  (e.g.,  the  10-yr  flood),  bridges  a  somewhat larger flood (e.g., the 25-year flood), and spillways of large dams the 100-year or larger flood. As explained in  section  4.4.3.2,  if  the  failure  of  a  dam  or  levee would cause great economic damage and loss of life, the  “probable  maximum  flood”  (PMF)  is  used  for the spillway design. A  crucial  question  in  selection  of  the  design rainfall  is  the  determination  of  the  storm  duration that will generate the required design flood for a par- ticular watershed. For a given region the critical du- ration  increases  with  watershed  area  (see  figure Chapter 10 Figure 10.47 In the systems view, watershed response consists only of event flow, Q*, which is volumetrically a measured or specified time distribution of P (see figure 10.49), routing through a specified transfer function, and addition of the predicted response to a specified base flow. (b) The inverse problem involves identification of the transfer function from observed time distributions of input and response. Once the transfer function for a given watershed is determined, it is used to forecast or predict responses to actual or design storms. 4.44);  it  is  generally  of  the  order  of  the  watershed’s time  of  concentration,  which  can  be  estimated  by formulas  like  those  summarized  in  table  10.8  on  p. 513. The critical duration for a given watershed can also  be  determined  by  trial  and  error.  To  do  this, rainfalls  of  a  given  return  period  and  varying  dura- tions are used as input to the RF-RO model, and the duration that gives the largest peak is selected. Another  important  question  in  generating  de- sign floods is the relationship between the return pe- riod  of  the  rainfall  used  as  model  input  and  the return  period  of  the  resulting  flood.

For instance, small culverts may be designed to pass a low return-period flood, while bridges and spillways of large dams require protection against larger floods, such as the 25-year or 100-year flood, respectively.

This relationship is important for determining the appropriate design rainfall for a given watershed, as larger watersheds require longer storm durations to generate the required design flood."}, {"question": "In the context of dam or levee design, why is the \"probable maximum flood\" used?", "answer": "The \"probable maximum flood\" is used in the design of dams or levees because the failure of these structures would cause great economic damage and loss of life. Using the probable maximum flood ensures that the spillway is designed to handle the largest possible flood, thereby minimizing the risk of catastrophic failure."}, {"question": "What is the challenge in selecting the design rainfall for a particular watershed?", "answer": "One of the challenges in selecting the design rainfall is determining the storm duration that will generate the required design flood for a particular watershed. This involves understanding the relationship between the return period of the rainfall and the resulting flood, as well as the characteristics of the watershed itself, such as its time of concentration and response to different storm durations."}, {"question": "How does the design of flood-control structures account for the uncertainty in flood predictions?", "answer": "The design of flood-control structures accounts for the uncertainty in flood predictions by using design floods of specified return periods. The selection of the return period is based on the consequences of the design flood being exceeded, with more critical structures requiring protection against larger, less frequent floods. This approach helps to manage the risk associated with flood events, although it does not eliminate the uncertainty inherent in flood predictions."}, {"question": "What is the role of the RF-RO model in determining the critical storm duration?", "answer": "The RF-RO model is used in determining the critical storm duration through a trial and error process. Rainfalls of a given return period and varying durations are used as input to the model, and the duration that gives the largest peak is selected as the critical storm duration for the given watershed. This approach allows for the identification of the storm duration that is most likely to produce the design flood for the watershed."}, {"question": "In the context of floodplain management, why is it important to accurately predict design floods?", "answer": "Accurately predicting design floods is crucial for floodplain management because it directly influences the design and effectiveness of flood-control structures and floodplain-management plans. Underestimating the design flood could lead to inadequate protection, resulting in damage and loss of life during flood events, while overestimating could lead to unnecessary costs and potential environmental impacts."}]}

Such estimates are also used to calibrate and validate rain- fall-runoff models using historical storms as inputs. Flood  forecasting  is  usually  done  via  complex hydrologic models that are to varying degrees physi- cally based, rather than the simple conceptual models discussed  in  section  10.6.4.  These  complex  models typically  divide  a  larger  watershed  into  subwater- sheds that are modeled separately, and contain simu- lations of the physical processes discussed in previous chapters, particularly snowmelt and infiltration. Such models  may  specifically  simulate  the  specific  runoff processes discussed earlier in this chapter, and gener- ally  contain  procedures  for  streamflow  routing.  Ex- cellent  reviews  of  such  models  and  their  use  in forecasting have been prepared by DeVries and Hro- madka (1992) and Lettenmaier and Wood (1992). Part III: Water Movement on the Land Box 10.7 Approaches to Developing Relations between Rainfall Return Period and Flood Return Period As noted by Pilgrim and Cordery (1992), there are four general approaches to this problem: 1. The  simplest  and  most  direct  approach  requires  (a) frequency  analysis  of  floods  at  gauging  stations  in the region of interest, using the methods described in box C.1 (which can be found on the disk accompa- nying the text) or methods that apply a specific prob- ability  distribution  and  (b)  frequency  analysis  of rainfalls  of  appropriate  durations  for  the  gauged watersheds. By trial and error, determine the model parameters  that  convert  a  rainfall  of  a  given  return period to a flood peak of the same return period. 2. For a given watershed, determine the model parame- ters  that  best  reproduce  the  measured  floods  for Figure 10.48 Use of systems models for forecasting and prediction. In addition to flood peaks, other charac- teristics of response, such as total flood volume or dura- tion, may also be forecasted or predicted. each of a number of events. Select the median values of  these  parameters  for  use;  this  should  result  in  a close correspondence between the return periods of rainfall and the resulting flood. 3. Calibrate  the  selected  model  for  the  watershed  of interest. Then use the model to generate a continu- ous  record  of  simulated  streamflows  from  a  long record of historical rainfall data. Finally, conduct a fre- quency  analysis  of  the  rainfall  and  flow  data,  and relate the return periods. 4. Conduct a joint probability analysis of parameters of an appropriate model and inputs.

Snowmelt, for instance, can contribute substantially to flood peaks, especially in regions with significant snowfall. Infiltration influences the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff, with higher infiltration capacities leading to less runoff and vice versa. By incorporating these processes, models can provide more accurate forecasts, which are vital for timely and effective flood warning systems."}, {"question": "How do the characteristics of a watershed, such as drainage area and channel slope, influence the time of concentration?", "answer": "The characteristics of a watershed, including drainage area, channel slope, and others like effective rainfall intensity and Manning’s resistance factor, influence the time of concentration. The time of concentration is the time it takes for runoff to travel from the most distant point in the watershed to the outlet. Formulas such as those listed in Table 10.8 provide estimates of the time of concentration based on these watershed characteristics, indicating that larger drainage areas and steeper slopes generally result in shorter times of concentration."}, {"question": "In the context of flood forecasting, what is the role of frequency analysis of floods at gauging stations?", "answer": "Frequency analysis of floods at gauging stations is used to determine the return periods of floods, which is essential for flood forecasting and risk assessment.

{"paragraph": "10.6.3.2 Determining Effective Rainfall Since  systems  models  relate  effective  rainfall  to storm runoff, calibration and validation of such mod- els requires separation of hyetographs. This is a criti- cal  problem,  because  the  total  volume  of  effective rainfall equals the volume of effective runoff and is a major determinant of the magnitude of the flood peak. Effective  water  input  P*  is  conventionally  con- sidered to be where P is total water input during an event. In equa- tion (10.63), losses = ET + ΔS  + ΔS  + ΔS where  ET  is  the  portion  of  the  event  water  evapo- transpired during the event; ΔS is the net addition to storage on the vegetative canopy (figure 6.19); ΔS the net addition to depression storage, i.e., the water added  to  lakes,  ponds,  wetlands,  puddles,  and smaller depressions (section 10.4.2.3); and ΔS net addition to soil-water storage during the event. Because rainfall events are usually of short dura- tion and are accompanied by high humidity and low solar radiation, ET is usually small. As discussed in section  6.6,  canopy-storage  capacity  is  on  the  order of  1  mm  ×  leaf-area  index.  Thus  it  is  usually  filled quickly, and ΔS is also usually negligible for storms that generate significant responses. As noted in section 10.4.2.3, depression storage is  spatially  variable  and  difficult  to  estimate,  and only  very  meager  data  on  depression-storage  vol- umes have been published. Values on the order of 5– 10  mm  have  been  estimated  for  turf  (Bras  1990). Evaporation and infiltration usually empty small sur- face depressions between rain storms (Kirkby 1988); however,  they  may  be maintained full during active snowmelt. Because of the difficulty of evaluating de- pression storage, it is usually treated conceptually in combination  with  soil-water  storage.  These  com- bined  storage  components  are  typically  modeled  as filling  in  the  same  way  that  infiltration  occurs  (fig- ures 8.10 and 8.21). Thus the ratio P*/P is largely de- termined by the degree to which the available near- surface storage capacity is already filled; i.e., by the antecedent soil-water content, θ . Operational meth- ods  for  relating  effective  water  input  to  antecedent conditions of watershed wetness are discussed in sec- tion 10.6.4.2.1 and box 10.8. However the transfer function is developed, it is important to emphasize that the validity of the esti- mate of P* is at least as important as the exact nature of the transfer function in determining the accuracy of  the  forecast  response  (figures  10.10  and  10.11). Unless  unusually  detailed  observations  of  storage components—especially  soil  moisture—are  avail- able,  there  is  very  little  basis  for  physically-based forecasts  or  predictions  of  the  quantity  of  effective water input. The need for such forecasts and predic- tions  has  thus  led  to  the  development  of  empirical methods for estimating P*. Most of these methods are based on one of the conceptual relations shown in figure 10.49. If one is attempting  to  solve  the  system-identification  prob- lem for a given watershed, one can determine the to- tal  losses  for  various  events  a  posteriori  by hydrograph separation, and then estimate their time distribution  via  one  of  the  models  in  figure  10.49. For future applications in predicting the response of the  watershed,  one  might  attempt  to  relate  P*  to  a measurable  quantity  that  reflects  basin  storage  via one  of  the  approaches  described  in  box  10.8  (on  p. 516)  and  10.9  (on  p.  517)  and  figures  10.50  and 10.51 (on p. 518).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of storm runoff modeling, why is determining effective rainfall crucial?", "answer": "Determining effective rainfall is crucial because it directly relates to the volume of effective runoff and is a major determinant of the magnitude of the flood peak.

The separation of hyetographs is essential for this process, highlighting the importance of understanding the components that contribute to effective rainfall."}, {"question": "How does the concept of effective water input P* account for losses during a rainfall event?", "answer": "The concept of effective water input P* accounts for losses by considering the total water input during an event minus the losses, which include evapotranspiration (ET), net additions to storage on the vegetative canopy (ΔS), net additions to depression storage (ΔS), and net additions to soil-water storage (ΔS) during the event. These losses are represented by the equation P* = P - (ET + ΔS + ΔS + ΔS), where P is the total water input. The significance of these losses varies, with ET usually being small due to high humidity and low solar radiation during rainfall events, and ΔS often being negligible for significant storms."}, {"question": "In the context of estimating effective water input, why are empirical methods commonly used?", "answer": "Empirical methods are commonly used for estimating effective water input (P*) because detailed observations of storage components, especially soil moisture, are usually not available.

These combined storage components are modeled as filling in the same way that infiltration occurs. This approach simplifies the estimation of effective water input by focusing on the degree to which the available near-surface storage capacity is already filled, which is determined by the antecedent soil-water content. However, the difficulty in evaluating depression storage due to its spatial variability and lack of data remains a challenge, with only meager data on depression-storage volumes available, such as estimates of 5-10 mm for turf."}, {"question": "What is the significance of antecedent soil-water content in determining the ratio of effective water input to total water input?", "answer": "The antecedent soil-water content (θ) significantly influences the ratio P*/P because it determines the degree to which the available near-surface storage capacity is already filled. When the soil is dry, more of the rainfall can become effective runoff, increasing the P*/P ratio. Conversely, when the soil is wet, a larger portion of the rainfall is stored, reducing the P*/P ratio. This relationship highlights the importance of considering antecedent conditions in estimating effective water input for storm runoff modeling."}, {"question": "In the context of system-identification problems for a given watershed, how can total losses for various events be determined?", "answer": "For a given watershed, total losses for various events can be determined a posteriori by hydrograph separation. This process involves analyzing the hydrograph (a graph of water flow over time) to separate the components of runoff, allowing for the estimation of total losses. Subsequently, the time distribution of these losses can be estimated via models that conceptualize the loss processes, such as those shown in figure concepts. This approach enables the calibration of storm runoff models by relating effective water input to observed runoff responses."}, {"question": "Why is the validity of the estimate of P* considered at least as important as the exact nature of the transfer function in determining the accuracy of the forecast response?", "answer": "The validity of the estimate of P* is crucial because it directly affects the accuracy of the forecast response. An accurate estimate of P* ensures that the model correctly represents the amount of rainfall that contributes to runoff, which is essential for predicting the magnitude and timing of the flood peak. The exact nature of the transfer function, while important, is secondary to the accuracy of P* because even a well-structured transfer function will produce inaccurate forecasts if the input (P*) is incorrect. Thus, ensuring the validity of P* estimates is paramount for reliable storm runoff forecasting."}, {"question": "How do evaporation and infiltration affect small surface depressions between rain storms?", "answer": "Evaporation and infiltration usually empty small surface depressions between rain storms.

The availability of data in larger watersheds often makes the unit-hydrograph method a more reliable choice for planning and designing water management structures."}, {"question": "What are the implications of using the rational method in urban areas for water management infrastructure design?", "answer": "The use of the rational method in urban areas for water management infrastructure design implies that the structures being planned are likely to be simple and relatively inexpensive, such as culverts, small bridges, and surface-drainage systems. This method's application suggests that the focus is on efficient and cost-effective solutions for managing runoff in urban environments, where space and budget constraints may be significant factors. By using the rational method, urban planners can design infrastructure that effectively handles runoff without incurring excessive costs, which is crucial for maintaining urban water quality and preventing flooding."}, {"question": "How does the availability of historical rainfall and runoff data influence the choice of rainfall-runoff model?", "answer": "The availability of historical rainfall and runoff data significantly influences the choice of rainfall-runoff model. Models like the unit-hydrograph method require such data to generate accurate design flows, making them suitable for areas where historical records are available. In contrast, models like the rational and SCS methods do not require extensive historical data, making them more versatile for areas with limited or no data. The choice of model, therefore, depends on the availability and quality of historical data, highlighting the importance of data collection and management in hydrological studies."}, {"question": "In the context of water resources management, what are the challenges implied by the use of synthetic unit hydrographs?", "answer": "The use of synthetic unit hydrographs implies challenges related to the lack of historical rainfall and runoff data in certain areas. This lack of data can lead to uncertainties in design flow estimates, potentially affecting the reliability and efficiency of water management infrastructure.

Given  a  watershed  in  which  the  hydrologic  charac- teristics  of  the  soils  (discussed  further  below)  have been mapped and a design rainfall volume, P, is spec- ified,  there  are  two  basic  computations  in  the peak  discharge,  .

Although Loague and Freeze (1985) found that the approach did not yield precise estimates, it may have some predictive value and be useful if data limita- tions preclude other approaches. Antecedent Rainfall Indices Following a storm, the storage components enumer- ated in equation (10.64) gradually empty. This process is approximated via an empirical antecedent rainfall index, I (d), which is calculated on a daily basis as (0) · kd, I (d) = I (10B8.2) where I (0) is the value for a day with rain, k is a constant (usually 0.80 < k < 0.98), and d is the number of days since the last rainfall. The values of I (0) and k are empiri- cally determined for a particular watershed. Conceptu- ally, I (0) represents the total watershed near-surface storage (usually expressed as a depth of water), and I (d) is the amount of water from the previous storm that remains in that storage on day d. One then identifies the empirical relation between P* and I (d) for past storms. Indices Related to Ground-Water and/or Soil-Water Levels Forecasts of P* for a particular watershed or region can be empirically related to water levels in observation wells or soil-water content measured at one or more index sites (Dunne et al. 1975; Troch et al. 1993).", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the Soil Conservation Service Curve-Number Method, what is the primary input required for estimating peak discharge?", "answer": "The primary input required is a design rainfall volume, P, and information on the hydrologic characteristics of the soils in the watershed."}, {"question": "How does the antecedent rainfall index, I(d), account for the gradual emptying of storage components after a storm?", "answer": "The antecedent rainfall index, I(d), is calculated on a daily basis using an empirical formula that takes into account the value for a day with rain, I(0), a constant k, and the number of days since the last rainfall, d.

Note from  figure  10.51  that  the  rationale  for  the  original relation  coincides  closely  with  the  behavior  of  infil- tration  when  rainfall  rate  exceeds  the  saturated  hy- draulic  conductivity  of  the  surface  soil,  as  modeled Empirical Relations with Antecedent Discharge Assuming that the rate of outflow from a watershed reflects the amount of water stored in it, as in equation (1.42) and the linear-watershed model of box 10.3, it is reasonable to attempt to relate P* to antecedent dis- charge, q . Figure 10.50 shows the relation between P*/P and q  for the same watershed portrayed in figure 10.10, and indicates that it has useful predictive ability there. Gburek (1990) reported similar results for a watershed in Pennsylvania, but with considerably greater scatter. Use of Continuous Watershed Models If calibrated and validated for a particular watershed, watershed models can be used to keep a running account of the state of the various storage components. When a water-input event occurs, the filling of those components can be estimated using models of the inter- ception, infiltration, and percolation processes as dis- cussed in earlier chapters; P* is then estimated as the residual. Several such models were described by Viess- man et al. (1989). Probability Models Beran and Sutcliffe (1972) described how the proba- bility distribution of P* can be determined from the dis- tribution of P in Britain. SCS Method In the absence of specific information on antecedent conditions, the SCS curve-number method described in box 10.9 is widely used in the United States to estimate P* given total rainfall P and information on watershed soils. by  the  Green-and-Ampt  approach  in  section  8.4.3. However,  the  model  is  not  explicitly  an  infiltration model,  and    supposedly  incorporates  all  water- shed  storage,  including  interception  and  surface  de- tention as well as subsurface storage. The  NRCS  classifies  and  maps  the  soils  in  the United  States  at  various  scales,  and  the  wide  accep- tance of the SCS-CN method is largely because values of S  can be determined from such maps, along with land-cover  information.  Each  mapped  soil  type  is  as- signed to one of the hydrologic soils groups described in table 10.10 on p. 519. These groups are based largely on minimum infiltration capacity, which should be ap- proximately equal to K  at the surface (chapter 8). Chapter 10 Box 10.9 SCS Approach to Forecasting P* for Rainstorms Original Formulation Figure 10.51 shows a schematic hyetograph for a rainstorm. The SCS approach assumes that the total storm rainfall volume P is allocated to: (1) initial abstraction, S , which is the amount of storage that must be satisfied before event flow can begin; (2) reten- tion, S , which is the amount of rain that falls after the initial abstraction is satisfied but does not contribute to the effective precipitation, P*. It is further assumed that the watershed has a maximum retention capacity S and that the following relation exists: (10B9.1) All the quantities are volumes expressed on a per water- shed area basis as lengths. The actual retention is Combining equations (10B9.1) and (10B9.2) and solving for P* yields (10B9.3) Examination of actual response hydrographs led to the generalization that S  = 0.2 · S  under conditions of “normal” watershed wetness. Substituting that relation into equation (10B9.3) gives (10B9.4) As explained in section 10.6.4.2.1, S  is estimated from a runoff curve number that is a function of watershed soils and land uses. Curve numbers may be adjusted to reflect unusually dry or wet antecedent conditions (watershed wetness at the beginning of a storm). Revised Formulation Although equation (10B9.4) is widely used, there are concerns about “severe structural inconsistencies” in the definitions of some of the quantities involved (Chen Runoff Generation and Streamflow 1982; Sabol and Ward 1983; Boughton 1989, 1994). These concerns led Michel et al. (2005) to reexamine the approach and to propose a revision that is hydrologically consistent. This approach involves defining a new param- eter, S , which is the volume of water stored in the soil at the beginning of a rainfall event, and characterizing ante- cedent conditions as the proportion of soil-water-stor- age capacity that is full at the storm onset, S /S . The revised approach leads to three equations for estimating P*, depending on general antecedent conditions: (10B9.5a) ◊(0.48 P) P S 0.72 (10B9.5b) ◊(0.79 P) P S 0.46 (10B9.5c) The value of S  is determined by the runoff curve num- ber, as in the original approach [equation (10.66), sec- tion 10.6.4.2]. Although not suggested by Michel et al. (2005), their model can be made more flexible by generalizing equa- tion (10B9.5) as (10B9.6) and calculating k  and k  as linear functions of S /S : S P 0 max (10B9.7) (10B9.8) k -0.48 1.47 . Part III: Water Movement on the Land Table  10.11  on  p.  520  gives  the curve  numbers assigned to each hydrologic soil group under various land uses. S  is determined from these curve num- bers, CN, as = - 254, where S  is in mm.  Note that this is  an  empirical dimensionally inhomogeneous equation, so the con- Figure 10.51 stants differ when other units are used (section 1.4). In  the  original  method,  curve  numbers  may  be  fur- ther adjusted to reflect the antecedent wetness of the watershed,  as  prescribed  in  table  10.12  on  p.  521; however, the values given in table 10.11 are used for most  design  purposes.

Results  like  those  shown  in  figure  10.52—for  a region in which the method should be well suited— suggest  that  it  is  unwise  to  accept  uncritically  the predictions of the SCS method. The user of the SCS- CN relations must bear in mind that they are gener- alized  and  may  not  be  very  accurate  for  a  specific watershed. The NRCS now recognizes that the rela- tion of a given set of soil and land-use conditions to curve number may vary regionally (Miller and Cron- Runoff Generation and Streamflow shey 1989). Thus field observations are always advis- able; one can make observations of rise times simply by measuring water levels at the basin outlet during a water-input event. However,  the  SCS-CN  approach  will  no  doubt continue  in  use  because:  (1)  it  is  computationally simple;  (2)  it  uses  readily available watershed  infor- mation;  (3)  it  has  been  “packaged”  in  readily  avail- able  tables,  graphs,  and  computer  programs;  (4)  it appears  to  give  “reasonable”  results  under  many conditions; and (5) in the absence of detailed water- shed  information,  there  are  few  other  practicable methodologies for obtaining a priori estimates of P* that  are  known  to  be  better  (Ponce  and  Hawkins 1996).

{"paragraph": "10.6.4.3.1 Definition One  of  the  most  venerable  and  widely  used transfer  functions  for  RF-RO  modeling  is  the hydrograph (also called the unit graph). For a given watershed, the “T -hr unit hydrograph” is its characteristic event-flow hydrograph in response to a unit volume (e.g., 1 in or 1 cm) of effective rainfall applied at a constant rate for T  hours. The  central  hypothesis  of  the  unit-hydrograph approach is that watershed response is linear: i.e., the ordinates  of  the  hydrograph  responding  to  a  steady input  of P* units for a duration T  are  equal to  P* times  the  ordinates  of  the  -hr  unit  hydrograph. This means that The time base T  of the hydrograph of event flow remains constant for all inputs of duration T .

{"paragraph": "10.6.4.3.6 Application of the Unit-Hydrograph Approach Freeze (1972a) concluded from a series of exper- iments with physically based models that “no physi- cal  reason  seems  to  exist  why  watersheds  should respond in a linear fashion,” and it is clear that the linear-response assumptions of unit-hydrograph the- ory  are  at  best  only  approximated  by  actual  water- sheds (see, for example, Valdes et al. 1979). However,  the  unit  hydrograph  is  often  the  only feasible way to  approach practical problems.  Dunne Figure 10.56 (a) The S-hydrograph for the watershed of box 10.11 derived by summing the 2.5-hr unit hydro- and  Leopold  (1978)  stated  that  the  unit-hydrograph method gives estimates of flood peaks that are usually within  25%  of  their  true  value;  this  may  be  close enough  for  most  planning  purposes  and  about  as close  as  can  be  expected  given  the  usual  lack  of  de- tailed  information  about  watershed  processes  and states. Errors larger than 25% can be expected if syn- thetic unit graphs are used without verification for the region of application. As noted earlier in this chapter, the assumption of linearity that underlies the unit-hy- drograph  approach  seems  most  valid  for  large  rain- > 100 km2). storms on relatively large watersheds (A The  most  important  difficulties  in  applying  the unit-hydrograph approach are: 1. The rainfall-runoff relationships are between effec- tive  input  and  event  response,  and  it  is  often  not Chapter 10 clear  how  to  make  reliable  a  priori  estimates  of effective input. There is usually little information about  the  magnitudes  of  the  loss  quantities  in equation (10.64), and since P* is usually small rel- ative to P, small relative errors in estimating those quantities  lead  to  large  relative  errors  in  estimat- ing event flow. 2. Because of the temporal variability of contributing area and rates of water movement, it is difficult to identify  characteristic  response  times  for  real watersheds.  In  fact,  unless  contributing  area  in  a given watershed follows exactly the same patterns of temporal and spatial change in every storm, the watershed cannot have a single unit hydrograph. 3. In  general,  the  characteristic  response  of  a  given drainage  basin  depends  strongly  on  antecedent conditions  (figures  10.10  and  10.11),  so  the assumption  of  linearity  of  response  may  be grossly  in  error,  except  for  large  storms  when  it can  be  assumed  that  watershed  storage  is  essen- tially filled. In  spite  of  these  difficulties,  Singh  et  al.  (2013) concluded  that  the  geomorphological  synthetic  unit hydrograph  approach  has  potential  for  estimating streamflow  responses  in  ungauged  watersheds,  be- cause it has a sound theoretical basis and can be im- plemented  using  geomorphological  and  stream- network information that can be extracted from digi- tal elevation models and remote-sensing observations.

Runoff Generation and Streamflow 3. Use  the  method  of  equation  (10.8)  to  determine  the drainage density of a region. 4. Obtain  the  hydrograph  of  a  stream  responding  to  a known rainfall and use one of the methods depicted in figure 9.34 to determine Q*, then assume P* = Q* and compute P*/P. Repeat  the  example  calculations  in  box  10.10  using the  revised  SCS-CN  method  described  in  box  10.9 and compare the two sets of results. 5. If soils and land-use information are available for the watershed used in exercise 4, compare the “actual” P* with that given by the SCS curve-number method. 6. Obtain  the hyetograph and hydrograph  for  a  rainfall event on a watershed. a. Separate  the  hydrograph  using  one  of  the  meth- ods of figure 9.34 and estimate the hyetograph of the effective rainfall (you may use a method simi- lar to the one used in the example of box 10.2). b. Estimate the centroid of the effective rain and cal- culate the centroid lag. c. Compare the “actual” values of centroid lag, peak- flow rate, and response time with T  given by one or more of the formulas in table 10.8, T  given by equation (10.68), and q  given by equation (10.71). 7. Compare the hydrograph of event flow developed in exercise 6 with that obtained via the linear-watershed model  (box  10.3)  for  the  same  effective  input  hyeto- graph, assuming T* = the “actual” centroid lag. 8. Compare the hydrograph of event flow developed in exercise 6 with that obtained via the SCS dimension- less unit hydrograph (table 10.13) for the same effec- tive input hyetograph. 9. From the geologic, soils, topographic, and vegetative conditions  in  your  region,  which  mechanism(s)  are likely  to  contribute  water  to  event  responses?  Have any studies that shed light on this question been done in the region? Globally,  a  small  fraction  of  continental  runoff  occurs  as ground water. Recall, though, that we have seen (section 9.5.5) that situations in which a portion of streamflow originates as ground-water inflow from outside the topographic watershed are not uncommon. So-called even if no actual flooding (overbank flow) occurs. The  question  of  event-flow  identification  is  relevant  to  snow- melt  events  also,  but  since  snowmelt  is  seldom  directly  mea- sured and snowmelt events are usually analyzed separately, we limit the discussion here to rainfall events. Snowmelt rates seldom exceed 0.5 cm/hr (see chapter 5). Appendix Measurement Precision, Significant Figures, and Unit and Equation Conversion A.1 Measurement Precision and Significant Figures A.1.1 Measured Quantities All measurements are made with finite precision. Precision is the “fineness,” or degree, to which a quantity is measured. Absolute precision may be ex- 1. explicitly as = x ± δx, where    is  the  measured  value,  x  is  the observer’s best estimate of the “true” value, and δx is  the  error  or  uncertainty  in  the  measurement, i.e., the bounds of the range in which the observer is  “reasonably  confident”  that  the  true  value  lies (see section 1.11); 2. in  terms  like  “measurements  were  made  to  the nearest u,” where u is some measurement unit; or 3. implicitly, as the number of significant figures in the reported value, where The number of significant figures in a measured quantity is equal to the number of digits beginning with the leftmost nonzero digit and extending to the right to include all digits warranted by the precision of the measurement. For example, if we were to measure a distance to the nearest centimeter, we would report it as, say, 21 cm. If we were to report the measurement as 21.0 cm or 21.00 cm, we would be implying that it had been made to the nearest 0.1 cm or 0.01 cm, respectively. However,  if  a  measurement  is  given  as,  say,  200  m, the  precision  is  not  clear  because  we  don’t  know  if the measurement was made to the nearest 1 m, 10 m, or 100 m. The best way of avoiding this ambiguity is to use scientific notation and express the quantity as Otherwise,  additional  information,  usually  in  the form  of  other  analogous  measurements,  is  required to clarify the situation. Note that the number of sig- nificant figures also indicates the range of relative pre- cision in a measured quantity: Significant Figures Relative Uncertainty Range 4 1/10,000 to 1/1,000 3 1/1,000 to 1/100 2 1/100 to 1/10 Appendix A Hydrologic  measurements  cannot  usually  be made with great precision, so Unless it is clear that greater precision is warranted, assume no more than three-significant-figure precision in measured hydrologic quantities.

In  computations  made  with  mea- sured quantities, including unit conversions (section A.2), the appropriate level of precision is obtained by observing rules 2 and 3: The absolute precision of a sum or dif- ference equals the absolute precision of the least absolutely precise number involved in the calculation. The number of significant figures of a product or quotient equals the number of significant figures of the least rela- tively precise number involved in the calculation. Examples in box A.1 show application of these rules. However, in order to avoid the risk of losing signifi- cant figures during calculations, you should observe In computations involving several steps, do not round off to the appropri- ate number of significant figures until you get to the final answer. Be  sure  to  do  the  appropriate  rounding  at  the  end, The numbers on computer printouts and calculator displays almost always have more digits than is warranted by the pre- cision of measured hydrologic quantities. As noted by Harte (1985, p. 4), Nonsignificant figures have a habit of accumulating in the course of a calculation, like mud on a boot, and you must wipe them off at the end. It is still good policy to keep one or two nonsignificant fig- ures during a calculation, however, so that the rounding off at the end will yield a better estimate. A.2 Unit Conversion A.2.1 Units with Common Zero Because of the common use of three systems of units  and the  proliferation  of  units  within  each sys- tem, hydrologists must become experts in the skill of converting from one set of units to another. Table  A.2  on  pp.  534–536  lists  quantities  com- monly  encountered  in  hydrological  practice,  in  di- mensional  categories.  All  quantities  listed  below each dimensional category are identical and, except for commonly used temperature units (discussed be- low), a zero value in one unit system is a zero value in the  other  systems.  For  these  quantities,  unit  con- versions are carried out by chaining quantities as nu- merators  and  denominators  to  make  a  multiplier (conversion factor) equal to unity, and the decision of whether to put the factor in the numerator or denom- inator  is  determined  by  the  direction  of  the  conver- sion.  For  example,  to  convert  a  pressure  of  4.23 mH O to kPa, 4.23 mH O 1.0198¥10-4 = 41.47872 kPa Æ 41.5 kPa. Note that All conversion factors have infinite precision; it is only the precision of the measured quantities that determines the significant figures of the converted value. Measurement Precision, Significant Figures, and Unit and Equation Conversion Box A.1 Examples of Correct Treatment of Precision Computations with Measured Quantities Example AB1.1 The average flow for two consecutive days is reported as 102 ft3/s and 3.2 ft3/s. What is the total for the two days? Answer: Adding the reported values gives 105.2 ft3/s, but since the larger flow was measured only to the nearest 1 ft3/s, rule 2 dictates that we report the total as 105 ft3/s. Example AB1.2 The average flow for two consecutive days is reported as 1,020 ft3/s and 3.2 ft3/s. What is the total for the two days? Answer: Here rule 2 dictates that the sum be reported as 1,020 ft3/s, because the larger flow was measured to the nearest 10 ft3/s. Example AB1.3 Given the following daily flows (in ft3/s), what is the total flow for the period? 27 104 12 2,310 6.4 0.11 256 Answer: Adding all these values gives 2,715.51 ft3/s, but since the largest value was measured only to the nearest 10 ft3/s, rule 2 dictates that we report the sum as 2,720 ft3/s. Example AB1.4 Discharge, Q, at a stream cross section is measured as the product of water-surface width, w, average depth, Y, and average velocity, U. The results of a measurement To report the discharge properly, first calculate However, because of rule 3, we report the discharge to two significant figures as Q = 42 m3/s. To state the uncer- tainty explicitly, follow rule 7 and write Q = 42 ± 1 m3/s. The  conversion  factors  in  table  A.2  are  given  to  at least  five  significant  figures  (those  given  as  “1”  are exact,  i.e.,  they  have  infinite  significant  figures)  so that rule 6 can be observed: In unit conversions, the number of dig- its retained in the conversion factors must be greater than the number of sig- nificant digits in any of the measured quantities involved. The above rules must be followed in all unit con- versions. However, the process can lead to some am- Temperature Conversion Example AB1.5 To convert a temperature difference of 3.4 F° to C°,", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In the context of the unit-hydrograph approach, why do watersheds not respond in a linear fashion according to Freeze (1972a)?", "answer": "According to Freeze (1972a), there is no physical reason why watersheds should respond in a linear fashion, indicating that the linear-response assumptions of unit-hydrograph theory are at best only approximated by actual watersheds. This non-linearity is due to various factors including the temporal variability of contributing area and rates of water movement, and the strong dependence of the characteristic response of a given drainage basin on antecedent conditions. The assumption of linearity seems most valid for large storms on relatively large watersheds, but even then, the unit-hydrograph approach has its limitations and potential for error."}, {"question": "How does the unit-hydrograph method estimate flood peaks, and what is the typical accuracy of these estimates?", "answer": "The unit-hydrograph method gives estimates of flood peaks that are usually within 25% of their true value, as stated by Dunne and Leopold (1978). This level of accuracy may be sufficient for most planning purposes, considering the usual lack of detailed information about watershed processes and states. However, errors larger than 25% can occur if synthetic unit graphs are used without verification for the region of application, highlighting the need for careful application and validation of the method."}, {"question": "In the application of the unit-hydrograph approach, what are the most important difficulties encountered?", "answer": "The most important difficulties in applying the unit-hydrograph approach include: 1) the challenge of making reliable a priori estimates of effective input due to the lack of information about loss quantities, 2) the difficulty in identifying characteristic response times for real watersheds due to temporal variability of contributing area and water movement rates, and 3) the strong dependence of the characteristic response on antecedent conditions, which can lead to gross errors in the assumption of linearity of response."}, {"question": "Why is the geomorphological synthetic unit hydrograph approach considered to have potential for estimating streamflow responses in ungauged watersheds?", "answer": "The geomorphological synthetic unit hydrograph approach is considered to have potential because it has a sound theoretical basis and can be implemented using geomorphological and stream-network information that can be extracted from digital elevation models and remote-sensing observations, as concluded by Singh et al. (2013). This approach offers a promising method for estimating streamflow responses in areas where data is limited or unavailable, by leveraging the physical characteristics of the watershed to predict hydrological behavior."}, {"question": "How does the size of the watershed influence the validity of the linearity assumption in the unit-hydrograph approach?", "answer": "The assumption of linearity in the unit-hydrograph approach seems most valid for large storms on relatively large watersheds (greater than 100 km^2). On smaller watersheds, the temporal variability of contributing area and rates of water movement, as well as the strong influence of antecedent conditions, can lead to significant non-linearity in the watershed's response, making the unit-hydrograph approach less accurate."}, {"question": "In the context of hydrologic measurements, why is it important to consider the precision of measured quantities?", "answer": "Considering the precision of measured quantities is crucial because hydrologic measurements cannot usually be made with great precision. Assuming more precision than warranted can lead to misleading results. The USGS, for example, reports discharge measurements with specific precision, and it is essential to follow rules for computations with measured quantities to ensure that the uncertainty in measured values is appropriately reflected in the results."}, {"question": "How do conversion factors in unit conversions affect the precision of the converted value?", "answer": "Conversion factors have infinite precision, so it is only the precision of the measured quantities that determines the significant figures of the converted value. To maintain accuracy, it is essential to use conversion factors with more significant figures than the measured quantities involved and to follow specific rules for rounding and reporting the results of unit conversions."}, {"question": "Why is it necessary to avoid rounding off to the appropriate number of significant figures until the final answer in computations involving several steps?", "answer": "Rounding off too early can lead to the loss of significant figures, which can accumulate errors in the final result. By keeping one or two nonsignificant figures during calculations and rounding off only at the end, a more accurate estimate can be obtained. This practice ensures that the final answer reflects the appropriate level of precision based on the original measured quantities."}, {"question": "In the context of measurement precision, what does the number of significant figures indicate?", "answer": "The number of significant figures in a measured quantity indicates the relative uncertainty range of the measurement. For hydrologic measurements, which typically cannot be made with great precision, assuming no more than three significant figures is often appropriate, and in many cases, only two significant figures are warranted. This reflects the"}]}
