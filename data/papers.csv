J. Li; B. Huang; H. Gui; X. Liu; J. Xu,2025,,,83.0,87.0,"The acceleration of urbanization in China has resulted in a direct impact on the efficiency of the rational use of water resources, as the urban water supply system plays an important role in urban construction. However, the issue of water supply pipe network leakage is becoming increasingly problematic, as it is directly related to the quality of life of urban residents and the smooth progress of industrial production. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately predict flow changes in urban water supply pipe networks and promptly identify instances of leakage. However, traditional deep learning models are not well-suited for effectively capturing long-term dependencies. In this study, we propose a water supply network flow prediction method based on the time series large language model (LLM) Chronos. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. In the course of our experiments, we utilized traffic data from the Haida neighborhood for the year 2023 for the purpose of model evaluation and comparison with traditional LSTM and GRU and the extant time series LLMs, MOMENT and Timer. The results of our experiments demonstrate that Chronos outperforms LSTM, GRU, MOMENT and Timer in all evaluation metrics, thereby substantiating its high degree of accuracy and effectiveness in predicting complex time series data.",2995-3251,10.1109/ICCCS65393.2025.11069945,IEEE,flow prediction;long-term dependencies;time series;LLM,Flow Prediction of Water Supply Network Based on Time Series Large Language Model,"China National General Machinery, Engineering Corporation, Hefei, China; Sinomach General Machinery, Science& Technology Co., Ltd., Hefei, China; School of Computing and Information Technology, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; Luoyang Bearing Research Institute Co., Ltd., Luoyang, China; School of Computing and Information Technology, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China",2025 10th International Conference on Computer and Communication System (ICCCS),979-8-3315-2314-5,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11069945,,18.0,,IEEE Conferences,"Flow Prediction of Water Supply Network Based on Time Series Large Language Model The acceleration of urbanization in China has resulted in a direct impact on the efficiency of the rational use of water resources, as the urban water supply system plays an important role in urban construction.

To address this problem, a low-cost wide-domain KBQA system construction framework called LCWD-QA is proposed by combining deep learning, knowledge graphs, and large language models. First, an entity span prediction model was designed to recognize potential entity mentions in sentences.

Previous research mainly focuses on network models tailored to specific degradation types, while recent unified frameworks and foundation models still face critical challenges in temporal consistency, automated degradation recognition, and detail preservation. Despite recent advances in foundation models, current approaches rely heavily on predefined degradation labels and remain focused on image-level operations, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios and struggling with preserving fine-grained details.

Through synergistic collaboration, these agents facilitate the training of a deep neural network-based navigation model (ESSNet) that operates efficiently during execution. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional reinforcement learning methods while ensuring operational robustness. 2025"

Synthetic Aperture Radar observations from Sentinel-1 provide the potential to monitor the variability of SMB processes through changes in the scattering response of near-surface and internal snow layers. However, the interplay between several factors, such as accumulation, wind erosion, deposition, and melt, complicates the interpretation of scattering changes of the microwave signal. Additionally, lack of reliable ground truth measurements of the snow surface limits our capability to associate the SMB processes with dominant scattering mechanism. In this study, we aim to quantify the dominant scattering in Sentinel-1 signal and evaluate the scattering changes in drifting snow-dominated regions of East Antarctica. We introduce a scattering indicator, $\alpha _{\text{scat},\varepsilon }$, derived from scattering-type and entropy descriptors, providing a measure between volume and pure scattering. By relating the field measurements to $\alpha _{\text{scat},\varepsilon }$, we establish that the evolution of dominant scattering in the presence of snowdrift is complex. First, $\alpha _{\text{scat},\varepsilon }$ strongly correlates with surface roughness ($R^{2}=0.92$, RMSE $=2^\circ$). Spatially variable erosion patterns significantly increase the roughness and result in a strong affinity towards pure scattering despite net accumulation.

Ma,2024,,,1.0,7.0,"In this paper, we encountered the major challenge of effectively solving Mathematical Word Problems (MWP) that involve complex logic and long text descriptions. To address these issues, we proposed the following methods: 1.Introduced a RoBERTa encoder optimized with a dynamic masking technique to enhance the understanding of MWP text. 2.Developed a decoder based on Shifted Window Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA), which limits the self-attention computation range while effectively capturing long-range dependencies, thereby improving decoding efficiency and accuracy. By combining these methods, we proposed a new RoBERTa-SWMSA model.

This innovative practice full paper describes the development and implementation of a professional development (PD) opportunity for secondary teachers to learn about ChatGPT. Incorporating generative AI techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT into educational environments offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Prior research has highlighted their potential to personalize feedback, assist in lesson planning, generate educational content, and reduce teachers' workload, alongside concerns such as academic integrity and student privacy. However, the rapid adoption of LLMs since ChatGPT's public release in late 2022 has left educators, particularly at the secondary level, with a lack of clear guidance on how LLMs work and can be effectively adopted. Objective. This study aims to introduce a comprehensive, free, and vetted ChatGPT course tailored for secondary teachers, with the objective of enhancing their technological competencies in LLMs and fostering innovative teaching practices. Method. We developed a five-session interactive course on ChatGPT capabilities, limitations, prompt-engineering techniques, ethical considerations, and strategies for incorporating ChatGPT into teaching. We introduced the course to six middle and high school teachers. Our curriculum emphasized active learning through peer discussions, hands-on activities, and project-based learning. We conducted pre- and post-course focus groups to determine the effectiveness of the course and the extent to which teachers' attitudes toward the use of LLMs in schools had changed. To identify trends in knowledge and attitudes, we asked teachers to complete feedback forms at the end of each of the five sessions.

To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent sentiment analysis algorithm based on a multi-model fusion approach: the Improved Dynamic Convolutional and Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Model (IDCAN-BiLSTM). The aim is to enhance the effectiveness of sentiment analysis for ice and snow tourism reviews. Firstly, the review data is cleaned, denoised, and segmented. High-quality text vector embeddings are then generated using pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to capture the deep semantic features of the review text. Subsequently, the IDCAN-BiLSTM model employs a Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to extract the local features of reviews, thereby increasing sensitivity to specific sentiment words. Following this, a Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism is utilized to focus on key sentiment information within the reviews, effectively addressing the challenges posed by complex and lengthy texts. Finally, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) module comprehensively captures the global contextual information in the reviews, improving both the sentiment classification accuracy and the contextual recognition capabilities of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the IDCAN-BiLSTM model achieves outstanding performance in the sentiment classification of ice and snow tourism reviews, with an accuracy of 92.17% and an F1 score of 0.93. These results significantly surpass those of traditional sentiment analysis methods. In particular, the model shows superior performance in the sentiment classification of long review texts, effectively enhancing the accuracy and granularity of sentiment recognition through dynamic convolution and the self-attention mechanism.

Following this, a Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism is utilized to focus on key sentiment information within the reviews, effectively addressing the challenges posed by complex and lengthy texts. Finally, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) module comprehensively captures the global contextual information in the reviews, improving both the sentiment classification accuracy and the contextual recognition capabilities of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the IDCAN-BiLSTM model achieves outstanding performance in the sentiment classification of ice and snow tourism reviews, with an accuracy of 92.17% and an F1 score of 0.93. These results significantly surpass those of traditional sentiment analysis methods. In particular, the model shows superior performance in the sentiment classification of long review texts, effectively enhancing the accuracy and granularity of sentiment recognition through dynamic convolution and the self-attention mechanism. Moreover, the model distinguishes sentiment tendencies across different user groups regarding their experiences in ice and snow tourism. This capability provides valuable data support for optimizing services and enabling precision marketing strategies in the ice and snow tourism sector. 2025"

Twitter is one of the important microblogging platform where people can share information known to them. Often these tweets are about local events. News agencies report on local events, but the time taken for an agency to analyse, investigate and report on the event can be substantial. Twitter users share their views and information about a particular event by posting tweets. These tweets can be used to identify whether the event occurred or not. Event detection from twitter data has gained importance nowadays. Our proposed system analyses tweets from a given geographical region to determine if an event occurred. The system then report the most descriptive tweet associated with an event occurred in that particular region. By the proposed system, it would be a quick way to alert people about an event occurring in their locality. In this, we split data into clusters based on location, identifies the tweet which exceeds the threshold, and then group the tweets based on similarity. The clustering models DBSCAN and HDBSCAN are employed to eliminate noise from the data and cluster similar tweets. Our system converts each tweet into a vector and normalise using TF-IDF technique. Finally, tweets which are similar on the same event will be analysed and collected.

Twitter is one of the important microblogging platform where people can share information known to them. Often these tweets are about local events. News agencies report on local events, but the time taken for an agency to analyse, investigate and report on the event can be substantial. Twitter users share their views and information about a particular event by posting tweets. These tweets can be used to identify whether the event occurred or not. Event detection from twitter data has gained importance nowadays. Our proposed system analyses tweets from a given geographical region to determine if an event occurred. The system then report the most descriptive tweet associated with an event occurred in that particular region. By the proposed system, it would be a quick way to alert people about an event occurring in their locality. In this, we split data into clusters based on location, identifies the tweet which exceeds the threshold, and then group the tweets based on similarity. The clustering models DBSCAN and HDBSCAN are employed to eliminate noise from the data and cluster similar tweets. Our system converts each tweet into a vector and normalise using TF-IDF technique. Finally, tweets which are similar on the same event will be analysed and collected. People can be notified of local events occurring before news outlets can report them when it is implemented in real time. The application varies on the type of event detected using our system. The News stations can also be intimated about the event so that they can explore further. 2021"

The early identification of water-based disasters can be lifesaving, and the challenge is to identify appropriate and timely warning measures. Social-media tools such as Twitter provide citizens with a real-time communication channel for reporting problems related to our environment, which allows humans to act as social sensors. In this article, we show the main results and lessons learned from the research project WATERoT, funded by the Spanish government. In this project, we designed a social sensing application (called WATERSensing) for the prevention and evaluation of water-related disasters with the participation of individuals through social networks.

These improvements are largely driven by extensive datasets and innovative model architectures. However, these models continue to struggle with edge-case conditions such as storms, snow, or fog. Addressing these challenges requires di-versified training data that encompasses a wide range of weather conditions. Unfortunately, current methods rely on the manual curation of such datasets, which is both costly and labor-intensive. To tackle this issue, we introduce CondDG (Conditional-Diffusion Data Generation), a novel synthetic data generation technique that leverages the latest advancements in conditional diffusion models to augment datasets with diverse and extreme weather conditions.

In order to excavate the cultural connotation of scenic spots, cultivate the growth point of characteristic tourism, strengthen the interaction between urban and rural tourism, and realize the goal of win-win regional tourism. This paper takes 209 popular tourist attractions in Beijing as the research object, crawls the scenic spot POI and comment text data from the Ctrip travel network, and uses text mining and spatial statistical analysis to explore the spatial distribution characteristics and image perception differences of urban and rural tourist attractions.

However, despite having such a large population, they only contribute roughly 13.9% of the nation’s total yearly GDP.

In order to increase crop output and quality, farmers typically depend on agricultural counselors and professionals to provide correct information for crop decision-making. Frequently, advisors or specialists in agriculture are not always available.

Kalyanaraman,2025,36,3.0,407.0,421.0,"Transformer models have become widely popular in numerous applications, and especially for building foundation large language models (LLMs). Recently, there has been a surge in the exploration of transformer-based architectures in non-LLM applications. In particular, the self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture offers a way to exploit any hidden relations within data, making it widely applicable for a variety of spatio-temporal tasks in scientific computing domains (e.g., weather, traffic, agriculture). Most of these efforts have primarily focused on accelerating the inference phase. However, the computational resources required to train these attention-based models for scientific applications remain a significant challenge to address. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures can achieve higher performance and better energy efficiency than their GPU-based counterparts.

This software-hardware co-design approach is aimed at adaptively reducing both runtime and energy costs during the training phase, without compromising on quality. Experiments on four concrete real-world scientific applications demonstrate that our hybrid approach is able to significantly reduce training time (up to $11.9\times$11.9×) and energy consumption (up to $12.05\times$12.05×), compared to the corresponding full-parameter training executing on only GPUs.

Recently, there has been a surge in the exploration of transformer-based architectures in non-LLM applications. In particular, the self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture offers a way to exploit any hidden relations within data, making it widely applicable for a variety of spatio-temporal tasks in scientific computing domains (e.g., weather, traffic, agriculture). Most of these efforts have primarily focused on accelerating the inference phase. However, the computational resources required to train these attention-based models for scientific applications remain a significant challenge to address. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures can achieve higher performance and better energy efficiency than their GPU-based counterparts. However, the frequent weight updates during training would necessitate write operations to NVM cells, posing a significant barrier for considering stand-alone NVM-based PIM architectures.

Moen,2020,,,1.0,4.0,"Ionospheric irregularities can greatly influence the trans-ionospheric signals due to the scintillation effect, and thus they can affect the satellite-based communication and navigation systems. Due to their practical space weather impacts, it is of great interest to study plasma irregularities and their generation mechanisms. However, our understanding of plasma structuring mechanisms at high latitudes is still not complete partially due to insufficient in situ data at high-resolution. The first Norwegian scientific satellite, NorSat-1, provides a good opportunity to enhance our understanding of the multi-scale features of ionospheric irregularities. Norsat-1 is a polar orbiting microsatellite at 600 km altitude. NorSat-1 carries the multi-needle Langmuir probe (m-NLP) system, which is capable of collecting currents from four different voltages at a rate up to 1 kHz. The electron density can be derived from the collected currents. Here we present a case study using the m-NLP instrument to characterize small-scale ionospheric plasma structures.

Due to their practical space weather impacts, it is of great interest to study plasma irregularities and their generation mechanisms. However, our understanding of plasma structuring mechanisms at high latitudes is still not complete partially due to insufficient in situ data at high-resolution. The first Norwegian scientific satellite, NorSat-1, provides a good opportunity to enhance our understanding of the multi-scale features of ionospheric irregularities. Norsat-1 is a polar orbiting microsatellite at 600 km altitude. NorSat-1 carries the multi-needle Langmuir probe (m-NLP) system, which is capable of collecting currents from four different voltages at a rate up to 1 kHz. The electron density can be derived from the collected currents. Here we present a case study using the m-NLP instrument to characterize small-scale ionospheric plasma structures.

Compared to traditional evaluation approaches, this framework effectively processes unstructured textual data and conducts comprehensive assessments across multiple dimensions. The study innovatively designs a text feature extraction model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Meanwhile, MADM methods are introduced for attribute weight allocation and decision optimization. The model employs BERT for in-depth semantic analysis of tourist reviews, utilizes CNN to extract local textual features, and combines MADM methods to generate comprehensive scores. In the study, the optimized model demonstrates a high consistency, achieving a consistency ratio of only 0.03 in the facilities and services theme. Moreover, this model significantly outperforms the Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Approach (RoBERTa), with a consistency ratio of 0.06.

Moreover, semantic recognition results that 49% of consumers' comments involve multiple topics, indicating that consumers have a pretty clear cognition of the complex status of the BDPD. Importantly, this study found some topics that had not been focused on in previous studies, such as more than 8% of consumers calling for government and legal departments to regulate BDPD behavior, which indicates that quite enough consumers are losing confidence in the self-discipline of the platform enterprises. Another interesting result is that consumers who pursue solutions to the BDPD belong to two mutually exclusive groups: government protection and self-protection. The significance of this study is that it reminds the e-commerce platforms to pay attention to the potential harm for consumers' psychology while bringing additional profits through the BDPD.

Similar to the questionnaires published results, this article verified that 61% of consumers expressed negative sentiment toward BDPD in general. Differently, on a finer scale, this study further measured the negative sentiments that differ significantly among different topics. The measurement results show that the topics Regular Customers Priced High (69%) and Usage Intention (67%) occupy the top two places of negative sentiment among consumers, and the topic Precision Marketing (42%) is at the bottom. Moreover, semantic recognition results that 49% of consumers' comments involve multiple topics, indicating that consumers have a pretty clear cognition of the complex status of the BDPD. Importantly, this study found some topics that had not been focused on in previous studies, such as more than 8% of consumers calling for government and legal departments to regulate BDPD behavior, which indicates that quite enough consumers are losing confidence in the self-discipline of the platform enterprises. Another interesting result is that consumers who pursue solutions to the BDPD belong to two mutually exclusive groups: government protection and self-protection. The significance of this study is that it reminds the e-commerce platforms to pay attention to the potential harm for consumers' psychology while bringing additional profits through the BDPD. Otherwise, the negative consumer attitudes may cause damage to brand image, business reputation, and the sustainable development of the platforms themselves. It also provides the government supervision departments an advanced analysis method reference for more effective administration to protect social fairness. 2022"

The recent developments of the International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service (IGS) Real-Time Pilot Project (RTPP) ease the difficulties of real-time determination of PWV. In this study, the quality of the real-time PPP-derived PWVs and their correlation with precipitation estimates from different global products are investigated. The accuracies of the orbits and clocks derived from the IGS02 streams are evaluated and their performance outperforms the predicted part of IGS Ultra-rapid (IGU) orbits and clocks. A year of GNSS observations from 9 stations located in Turkey are processed to estimate the PWV in the real-time. Since there are no stations to collect meteorological data near GNSS stations, the real-time solutions employ empirical Global Pressure and Temperature 3 (GPT3) and its fully consistent discrete Vienna Mapping Function 3 (VMF3) to model the troposphere. The performance of the PWV estimates is assessed by comparing with Radiosonde-derived PWV values and post-processed PPP-derived PWV estimates employing the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) final orbits and clocks. At most sites, the root-mean-square (RMS) differences of the estimated PWVs in comparison with the radiosonde-derived PWVs are less than 2.4 mm with correlation coefficients greater than 0.90. The RMS differences between RT and post-processed PPP PWV estimates are found to be less than 1.2 mm. The estimated RT zenith total delays (ZTDs) at two IGS sites agree well with the ZTDs provided by the IGS final products.

Experimental analyses of the proposal are undertaken by comparing the daily SDs of the PWV estimates and the daily accumulated precipitation estimates from the global precipitation grids produced from rain gauges, satellite images, and reanalyses product sets. The results show that the daily variation of the PWVs and the high precipitation estimates present a good agreement for some days but not always.

Hu J.; Miao C.; Wu Y.; Su J.,2025,,,,,"Hydrology investigates the water cycle and its relationship with the environment and societal activities, and forms the foundation for sustainable water resource management and ecological conservation. A quantitative review of hydrology aids in the scientific prediction of water resource trends, optimizing their allocation, and addressing challenges posed by climate change. However, traditional studies have lacked a systematic quantitative review of Chinese hydrology, particularly at the basin scale and across diverse research topics. Therefore, we employed advanced technologies, including large language models, regular expression techniques, and dynamic topic modeling, to conduct a quantitative analysis of hydrological research in China from 2000 to 2023 based on 289,513 hydrology-related publications. We examined the characteristics, research topics, and spatiotemporal evolution patterns of publications from China's major basins. The results reveal a significant increase in Chinese hydrology publications (about 19 papers/year) and research collaboration (0.9 authors/decade). The soil and water assessment tool (46.7% usage), variable infiltration capacity model (15.7%), and Xinanjiang model (11.9%) were the most widely used hydrological models in Chinese research. The Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Haihe River basins received the most attention, with key research topics spanning water resources (13.9%), climate change (13.6%), and hydrological modeling (10.8%). A shift from resource-oriented studies to ecological hydrology was observed, with a growing focus on climate change and carbon dynamics. These findings reflect the evolution of Chinese hydrology from traditional water resource management to addressing contemporary environmental challenges, offering valuable insights for future research in China and globally. © 2025",20969457,10.1016/j.fmre.2025.05.002,KeAi Communications Co.,Basins; China; Hydrology; Large language models; Topic modeling,Advances in hydrological research in China over the past two decades: Insights from advanced large language model and topic modeling,"State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China",,,"The authors acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (U24A20572, 42342023), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2024YFF0809301)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006697539&doi=10.1016%2fj.fmre.2025.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=e3600797987e7870cdc9e554d8b528e7,0.0,"Bierkens M.F.P., Global hydrology 2015: State, trends, and directions, Water.

A quantitative review of hydrology aids in the scientific prediction of water resource trends, optimizing their allocation, and addressing challenges posed by climate change. However, traditional studies have lacked a systematic quantitative review of Chinese hydrology, particularly at the basin scale and across diverse research topics. Therefore, we employed advanced technologies, including large language models, regular expression techniques, and dynamic topic modeling, to conduct a quantitative analysis of hydrological research in China from 2000 to 2023 based on 289,513 hydrology-related publications. We examined the characteristics, research topics, and spatiotemporal evolution patterns of publications from China's major basins. The results reveal a significant increase in Chinese hydrology publications (about 19 papers/year) and research collaboration (0.9 authors/decade). The soil and water assessment tool (46.7% usage), variable infiltration capacity model (15.7%), and Xinanjiang model (11.9%) were the most widely used hydrological models in Chinese research. The Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Haihe River basins received the most attention, with key research topics spanning water resources (13.9%), climate change (13.6%), and hydrological modeling (10.8%). A shift from resource-oriented studies to ecological hydrology was observed, with a growing focus on climate change and carbon dynamics. These findings reflect the evolution of Chinese hydrology from traditional water resource management to addressing contemporary environmental challenges, offering valuable insights for future research in China and globally. © 2025 2025"

The success of artificial intelligence in computer vision and natural language processing largely stems from its ability to train deep models effectively. We have thus conducted a systematic study on deep GNN models. Our findings indicate that the current success of deep GNNs primarily stems from (I) the adoption of innovations from CNNs, such as residual/skip connections, or (II) the tailor-made aggregation algorithms like DropEdge. However, these algorithms often lack intrinsic interpretability and indiscriminately treat all nodes within a given layer in a similar manner, thereby failing to capture the nuanced differences among various nodes. In this paper, we introduce the Snowflake Hypothesis - a novel paradigm underpinning the concept of ""one node, one receptive field''. The hypothesis draws inspiration from the unique and individualistic patterns of each snowflake, proposing a corresponding uniqueness in the receptive fields of nodes in the GNNs. We employ the simplest gradient and node-level cosine distance as guiding principles to regulate the aggregation depth for each node, and conduct comprehensive experiments including: (1) different training scheme; (2) various shallow and deep GNN backbones; (3) various numbers of layers (8, 16, 32, 64) on multiple benchmarks; (4) compare with different aggregation strategies. The observational results demonstrate that our framework can serve as a universal operator for a range of tasks, and it displays tremendous potential on deep GNNs.

While motivations and emotions have long been considered at the core of exploring how people take actions in human activities, there has been relatively little research supporting analyzing the relationship between human mental states and actions. We present the first study that investigates the viability of modeling motivations, emotions, and actions in language-based human activities, named COMMA (Cognitive Framework of Human Activities). Guided by COMMA, we define three natural language processing tasks (emotion understanding, motivation understanding and conditioned action generation), and build a challenging dataset HAIL‡ through automatically extracting samples from Story Commonsense.

Gori A.; Moura B.B.; Sillo F.; Alderotti F.; Pasquini D.; Balestrini R.; Ferrini F.; Centritto M.; Brunetti C.,2023,878,,,,"Over the last few decades, extensive dieback and mortality episodes of Quercus ilex L. have been documented after severe drought events in many Mediterranean forests. However, the underlying physiological, anatomical, and biochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the physiological and biochemical processes linked to embolism formation and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) dynamics in Q. ilex seedlings exposed to severe water stress and rewatering. Measurements of leaf gas exchange, water relations, non-structural carbohydrates, drought-related gene expression, and anatomical changes in wood parenchyma were assessed. Under water stress, the midday stem water potential dropped below - 4.5 MPa corresponding to a ~ 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity. A 70 % reduction in stomatal conductance led to a strong depletion of wood NSCs. Starch consumption, resulting from the upregulation of the β-amylase gene BAM3, together with the downregulation of glucose (GPT1) and sucrose (SUC27) transport genes, suggests glucose utilization to sustain cellular metabolism in the wood parenchyma. After rewatering, the presence of residual xylem embolism led to an incomplete recovery of leaf gas exchanges. However, the partial restoration of photosynthesis allowed the accumulation of new starch reserves in the wood parenchyma and the production of new narrower vessels. In addition, changes in the cell wall composition of the wood parenchyma fibers were observed. Our findings indicate that thirty days of rewatering were sufficient to restore the NSCs reserves and growth rates of Q. ilex seedlings and that the carryover effects of water stress were primarily caused by hydraulic dysfunction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",00489697,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163124,Elsevier B.V.,Drought responsive genes; Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs); Quercus ilex; Rewatering; Water stress; Wood parenchyma; Xylem embolism,"Unveiling resilience mechanisms of Quercus ilex seedlings to severe water stress: Changes in non-structural carbohydrates, xylem hydraulic functionality and wood anatomy","University of Florence, Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry (DAGRI), Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, 50019, Italy; National Research Council of Italy, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection (IPSP), Sesto Fiorentino, Florence and Turin, 50019 and 10135, Italy",,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151518134&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163124&partnerID=40&md5=c96abb469bb89cc839d510dd2e4ce514,12.0,"Aguade D., Poyatos R., Rosas T., Martinez-Vilalta J., Comparative drought responses of Quercus ilex L. and Pinus sylvestris L. in a montane forest undergoing a vegetation shift, Forests, 6, 8, pp. 2505-2529, (2015); Allen C.D., Macalady A.K., Chenchouni H., Bachelet D., McDowell N., Vennetier M., Et al., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests, For.

However, the underlying physiological, anatomical, and biochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the physiological and biochemical processes linked to embolism formation and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) dynamics in Q. ilex seedlings exposed to severe water stress and rewatering. Measurements of leaf gas exchange, water relations, non-structural carbohydrates, drought-related gene expression, and anatomical changes in wood parenchyma were assessed. Under water stress, the midday stem water potential dropped below - 4.5 MPa corresponding to a ~ 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity. A 70 % reduction in stomatal conductance led to a strong depletion of wood NSCs. Starch consumption, resulting from the upregulation of the β-amylase gene BAM3, together with the downregulation of glucose (GPT1) and sucrose (SUC27) transport genes, suggests glucose utilization to sustain cellular metabolism in the wood parenchyma. After rewatering, the presence of residual xylem embolism led to an incomplete recovery of leaf gas exchanges. However, the partial restoration of photosynthesis allowed the accumulation of new starch reserves in the wood parenchyma and the production of new narrower vessels. In addition, changes in the cell wall composition of the wood parenchyma fibers were observed. Our findings indicate that thirty days of rewatering were sufficient to restore the NSCs reserves and growth rates of Q. ilex seedlings and that the carryover effects of water stress were primarily caused by hydraulic dysfunction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V. 2023"

Debernardi C.; Seeber M.; Cattaneo M.,2024,152,,,,"Bibliometric overviews of climate change research typically focus on the main topical trends and few countries with the largest share of the scientific production. These are important limitations: most of the world's population live in countries that are heavily affected by climate change but have a relatively small scientific production, so that their topics of interest might be neglected. This contribution aims to address both limitations by investigating variations across countries in climate change research specialization. We employ a combination of state-of-the-art language modelling techniques to gain a fine-grained representation of the research topics on climate change, considering abstracts of 193,471 publications from 1990 to 2020. The analysis reveals the existence of five major country blocks, with distinct research specializations. Countries’ research specialization is driven by the specific challenges posed by climate change, such as extreme precipitation and floods and food, as well as the level of resources at disposal, so that research into the phenomenon of climate change and its global solutions is more important in affluent western countries. Less affluent countries – which host several billion people – develop distinct research focuses on local problems’ causes and mitigation strategies, but typically have limited resources to address these challenges. Hence, leading scientific countries should possibly contribute even more to addressing such issues. © 2023 The Authors",14629011,10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103663,Elsevier Ltd,Bibliometrics; Climate change; Developing countries; Geographic specialization; Natural language processing,Thirty years of climate change research: A fine-grained analysis of geographical specialization,"Department of Political Science and Management, University of Agder, Norway; Department of Social and Political Sciences, University of Milan, Italy; Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy",,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181047603&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2023.103663&partnerID=40&md5=30f8a4200e1c103cfd63016237a63d5a,5.0,"Aleixandre-Benavent R., Aleixandre-Tudo J.L., Castello-Cogollos L., Aleixandre J.L., Trends in scientific research on climate change in agriculture and forestry subject areas (2005), J.

These are important limitations: most of the world's population live in countries that are heavily affected by climate change but have a relatively small scientific production, so that their topics of interest might be neglected. This contribution aims to address both limitations by investigating variations across countries in climate change research specialization. We employ a combination of state-of-the-art language modelling techniques to gain a fine-grained representation of the research topics on climate change, considering abstracts of 193,471 publications from 1990 to 2020. The analysis reveals the existence of five major country blocks, with distinct research specializations. Countries’ research specialization is driven by the specific challenges posed by climate change, such as extreme precipitation and floods and food, as well as the level of resources at disposal, so that research into the phenomenon of climate change and its global solutions is more important in affluent western countries. Less affluent countries – which host several billion people – develop distinct research focuses on local problems’ causes and mitigation strategies, but typically have limited resources to address these challenges. Hence, leading scientific countries should possibly contribute even more to addressing such issues. © 2023 The Authors 2024"
Maity D.; Sabnis A.S.,2023,123,,459,475,"The incorporation of nanoparticles in various coatings has enhanced coating performances, thus attracting many researchers to explore nanocomposite coatings. In order to synthesize a novel nanocomposite coating, dehydrated castor oil (DCO - biobased non-edible vegetable oil) was epoxidized with performic acid (HCOOOH) and cured with methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MTHPA) in presence of tertiary amine accelerator, 1-methyl imidazole (1-MI) and characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR. Simultaneously, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing zinc acetate dihydrate (ZnAc2) with oxalic acid dihydrate (Ox2) by precipitation method and then modified organically with (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) by sol–gel method which was confirmed by DLS, FTIR, XRD, E-SEM, EDAX, TEM and XPS. These GPTMS-modified ZnO (G-ZnO) nanoparticles were incorporated into EDCO in various concentrations (0–3 wt%) and their mechanical, chemical, thermal and anticorrosion performances were evaluated. All the coatings demonstrated outstanding mechanical and chemical properties (except for alkali resistance) whereas thermal resistance and anticorrosion properties were enhanced with increase in the loading of G-ZnO nanoparticles. © 2023 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",1226086X,10.1016/j.jiec.2023.03.064,Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry,Dehydrated castor oil (DCO); Epoxidation; GPTMS; Nanocomposite coatings; Nanoparticles; Peracid; Zinc oxide,Anhydride-cured epoxidized dehydrated castor oil (EDCO) containing organically modified zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles,"Dept. of Polymer and Surface Engineering, Institute of Chemical Technology, N.P.

Shen R.; Inoue N.; Guan D.; Cai R.; Kot A.C.; Shinoda K.,2025,,,,,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a challenging task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between visual perception and linguistic comprehension. Traditional VQA approaches do not distinguish between data processing and reasoning, limiting their interpretability and generalizability in complex and diverse scenarios. Conversely, Programmatic Visual Question Answering (PVQA) models leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate executable codes, providing answers with detailed and interpretable reasoning processes. However, existing PVQA models typically rely on simplistic input-output prompting, which struggles to elicit domain-specific knowledge from LLMs and often produces unclear or extraneous outputs. Furthermore, PVQA models typically rely on a basic in-context example (ICE) selection methodology that is heavily influenced by individual word similarity rather than the overall sentence context. This leads to suboptimal ICE selection and a reliance on dataset-specific ICE candidates. In this paper, we propose ContextualCoder, a novel prompting framework tailored for PVQA models. ContextualCoder leverages frozen LLMs for code generation and pre-trained visual models for code execution, eliminating the need for extensive training and enhancing model flexibility. By incorporating an innovative prompting methodology and a novel ICE selection strategy, ContextualCoder facilitates the use of diverse in-context information for code generation, thereby improving the performance of PVQA models. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models, as evidenced by comprehensive experiments across diverse VQA datasets, including multilingual scenarios.  © 2025 IEEE.",15209210,10.1109/TMM.2025.3543043,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,code generation;

Traditional VQA approaches do not distinguish between data processing and reasoning, limiting their interpretability and generalizability in complex and diverse scenarios. Conversely, Programmatic Visual Question Answering (PVQA) models leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate executable codes, providing answers with detailed and interpretable reasoning processes. However, existing PVQA models typically rely on simplistic input-output prompting, which struggles to elicit domain-specific knowledge from LLMs and often produces unclear or extraneous outputs. Furthermore, PVQA models typically rely on a basic in-context example (ICE) selection methodology that is heavily influenced by individual word similarity rather than the overall sentence context. This leads to suboptimal ICE selection and a reliance on dataset-specific ICE candidates. In this paper, we propose ContextualCoder, a novel prompting framework tailored for PVQA models. ContextualCoder leverages frozen LLMs for code generation and pre-trained visual models for code execution, eliminating the need for extensive training and enhancing model flexibility. By incorporating an innovative prompting methodology and a novel ICE selection strategy, ContextualCoder facilitates the use of diverse in-context information for code generation, thereby improving the performance of PVQA models. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models, as evidenced by comprehensive experiments across diverse VQA datasets, including multilingual scenarios.  © 2025 IEEE. 2025"
Zang D.; Ding Y.; Zhao J.; Tang K.; Zhu H.,2024,601,,,,"Due to the influence of global climate anomalies, abnormal weather conditions such as heavy rainfall have become more frequent in recent years, posing a significant threat to the operation of transportation systems. An effective assessment of the resilience of the transportation system before and during heavy rain can alert the transportation department to take necessary emergency actions. However, existing methods for assessing the rainfall resilience of transportation networks mostly suffer from the following problems: (1) Simulation methods for modeling rainfall impacts lack realism; (2) After-the-fact evaluations of resilience cannot offer advance warning prior to or during a heavy rain event. To address above problems, we present a novel resilience assessment methodology for evaluating the resilience of road networks in real-time during heavy rainfall scenarios. In this methodology, we propose the temporal decomposition-based dynamic multi-granularity graph neural network (TD2MG2NN) for long-term traffic speed forecasting, providing a perspective on the future evolution of traffic states for accurate resilience assessment. In addition, we construct a composite traffic resilience indicator, designed to comprehensively reflect changes in the spatial–temporal resilience of the transportation system during heavy rain. Experimental results on four publicly real datasets indicate that the prediction performance of TD2MG2NN outperforms state-of-the-art models. The assessment results for the transportation road network in California demonstrate that the comprehensive resilience indicator is superior to single functional resilience indicator and the real-time methodology for evaluating resilience can accurately depict and predict the operation of the road network system under heavy rainfall scenarios. © 2024 The Authors",09252312,10.1016/j.neucom.2024.128207,Elsevier B.V.,Dynamic multi-granularity graph; Heavy rainfall scenarios; Multiscale temporal decomposition; Resilience assessment; Spatial–temporal traffic speed,Predictive resilience assessment of road networks based on dynamic multi-granularity graph neural network,"Key Laboratory of Embedded System and Service Computing, Ministry of Education; Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, No. 4800, Cao'an Road, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering, Ministry of Education; College of Transportation Engineering, Tongji University, No. 4800, Cao'an Road, Shanghai, China",,,"This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61876218 , 52302414 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Tongji University cross-discipline joint program ( 2022-3-YB-06 ).

Xiong J.; Hswen Y.; Naslund J.A.,2020,17,14,1,15,"Globally, water scarcity has become a common challenge across many regions. Digital surveillance holds promise for monitoring environmental threats to population health due to severe drought. The 2019 Chennai water crisis in India resulted in severe disruptions to social order and daily life, with local residents suffering due to water shortages. This case study explored public opinion captured through the Twitter social media platform, and whether this information could help local governments with emergency response. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were used to explore public opinion through Twitter during the 2019 Chennai water crisis. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method identified topics that were most frequently discussed. A naïve Tweet classification method was built, and Twitter posts (called tweets) were allocated to identified topics. Topics were ranked, and corresponding emotions were calculated. A cross-correlation was performed to examine the relationship between online posts about the water crisis and actual rainfall, determined by precipitation levels. During the Chennai water crisis, Twitter users posted content that appeared to show anxiety about the impact of the drought, and also expressed concerns about the government response. Twitter users also mentioned causes for the drought and potential sustainable solutions, which appeared to be mainly positive in tone. Discussion on Twitter can reflect popular public opinion related to emerging environmental health threats. Twitter posts appear viable for informing crisis management as real-time data can be collected and analyzed. Governments and public health officials should adjust their policies and public communication by leveraging online data sources, which could inform disaster prevention measures. © 2020 by the authors.

Digital surveillance holds promise for monitoring environmental threats to population health due to severe drought. The 2019 Chennai water crisis in India resulted in severe disruptions to social order and daily life, with local residents suffering due to water shortages. This case study explored public opinion captured through the Twitter social media platform, and whether this information could help local governments with emergency response. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were used to explore public opinion through Twitter during the 2019 Chennai water crisis. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method identified topics that were most frequently discussed. A naïve Tweet classification method was built, and Twitter posts (called tweets) were allocated to identified topics. Topics were ranked, and corresponding emotions were calculated. A cross-correlation was performed to examine the relationship between online posts about the water crisis and actual rainfall, determined by precipitation levels. During the Chennai water crisis, Twitter users posted content that appeared to show anxiety about the impact of the drought, and also expressed concerns about the government response. Twitter users also mentioned causes for the drought and potential sustainable solutions, which appeared to be mainly positive in tone. Discussion on Twitter can reflect popular public opinion related to emerging environmental health threats. Twitter posts appear viable for informing crisis management as real-time data can be collected and analyzed. Governments and public health officials should adjust their policies and public communication by leveraging online data sources, which could inform disaster prevention measures. © 2020 by the authors.

Jiang N.; Saftics A.; Romano E.; Ghaeli I.; Resto C.; Robles V.; Das S.; Van Keuren-Jensen K.; Seewaldt V.L.; Jovanovic-Talisman T.,2024,22,1,,,"Background: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer can significantly benefit from HER2-directed therapy – such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. However, some patients can develop therapy resistance or change HER2 status. Thus, we urgently need new, noninvasive strategies to monitor patients frequently. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from tumor cells are emerging as potential biomarker candidates. These membrane-delimited nanoparticles harbor molecular signatures of their origin cells; report rapidly on changes to cellular status; and can be frequently sampled from accessible biofluids. Results: Using Single Extracellular VEsicle Nanoscopy (SEVEN) platform that combines affinity isolation of EVs with super-resolution microscopy, here we provide multiparametric characterization of EVs with ~ 8 nm precision and molecular sensitivity. We first interrogated cell culture EVs affinity-enriched in tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81; these transmembrane proteins are commonly found on EV membranes. SEVEN robustly provided critical parameters of individual, tetraspanin-enriched EVs: concentration, size, shape, molecular cargo content, and heterogeneity. Trastuzumab-resistant cells (vs. trastuzumab-sensitive) secreted more EVs. Additionally, EVs from trastuzumab-resistant cells had lower tetraspanin density and higher HER2 density. We also evaluated EVs affinity-enriched in HER2; we found that these EVs (vs. tetraspanin-enriched) were larger and more elongated. We further optimized analytical sample processing to assess a rare population of HER2-enriched EVs from patient plasma. In breast cancer patients with elevated HER2 protein expression (vs. controls), HER2-enriched EVs had distinct characteristics including typically increased number of tetraspanin molecules and larger size. Importantly, these EVs were on average 25-fold more abundant compared to no cancer controls. Conclusions: SEVEN revealed unique characteristics of HER2-enriched EVs in cultured cells and complex biological fluid. In combination with current clinical approaches, this method is well poised to support precise therapeutic decisions.

However, some patients can develop therapy resistance or change HER2 status. Thus, we urgently need new, noninvasive strategies to monitor patients frequently. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from tumor cells are emerging as potential biomarker candidates. These membrane-delimited nanoparticles harbor molecular signatures of their origin cells; report rapidly on changes to cellular status; and can be frequently sampled from accessible biofluids. Results: Using Single Extracellular VEsicle Nanoscopy (SEVEN) platform that combines affinity isolation of EVs with super-resolution microscopy, here we provide multiparametric characterization of EVs with ~ 8 nm precision and molecular sensitivity. We first interrogated cell culture EVs affinity-enriched in tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81; these transmembrane proteins are commonly found on EV membranes. SEVEN robustly provided critical parameters of individual, tetraspanin-enriched EVs: concentration, size, shape, molecular cargo content, and heterogeneity. Trastuzumab-resistant cells (vs. trastuzumab-sensitive) secreted more EVs. Additionally, EVs from trastuzumab-resistant cells had lower tetraspanin density and higher HER2 density. We also evaluated EVs affinity-enriched in HER2; we found that these EVs (vs. tetraspanin-enriched) were larger and more elongated. We further optimized analytical sample processing to assess a rare population of HER2-enriched EVs from patient plasma. In breast cancer patients with elevated HER2 protein expression (vs. controls), HER2-enriched EVs had distinct characteristics including typically increased number of tetraspanin molecules and larger size. Importantly, these EVs were on average 25-fold more abundant compared to no cancer controls. Conclusions: SEVEN revealed unique characteristics of HER2-enriched EVs in cultured cells and complex biological fluid. In combination with current clinical approaches, this method is well poised to support precise therapeutic decisions. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024. 2024"

Chew Y.J.; Ooi S.Y.; Pang Y.H.; Lim Z.Y.,2024,15,6,,,"This study developed a comprehensive framework using Google Earth Engine to efficiently generate a forest fire inventory dataset, which enhanced data accessibility without specialized knowledge or access to private datasets. The framework is applicable globally, and the datasets generated are freely accessible and shareable. By implementing the framework in Peninsular Malaysia, significant forest fire factors were successfully extracted, including the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI), soil moisture, temperature, windspeed, land surface temperature (LST), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), landcover, and precipitation, among others. Additionally, this study also adopted large language models, specifically GPT-4 with the Noteable plugin, for preliminary data analysis to assess the dataset’s validity. Although the plugin effectively performed basic statistical analyses and visualizations, it demonstrated limitations, such as selectively dropping or choosing only relevant columns for tests and automatically modifying scales. These behaviors underscore the need for users to perform additional checks on the codes generated to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended analyses. The initial findings indicate that factors such as KBDI, LST, climate water deficit, and precipitation significantly impact forest fire occurrences in Peninsular Malaysia. Future research should explore extending the framework’s application to various regions and further refine it to accommodate a broader range of factors. Embracing and rigorously validating large language model technologies, alongside developing new tools and plugins, are essential for advancing the field of data analysis. © 2024 by the authors.",19994907,10.3390/f15060923,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),ChatGPT; data extraction framework; disaster behavior; forest fire behavior; forest fire dataset; Google Earth Engine; large language model; Malaysia; Noteable; remote sensing,Framework to Create Inventory Dataset for Disaster Behavior Analysis Using Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Peninsular Malaysia for Historical Forest Fire Behavior Analysis,"Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Multimedia University, Jalan Ayer Keroh Lama, Melaka, 75450, Malaysia",,,"This research work was supported by a Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under the Ministry of Education and Multimedia University, Malaysia (Project ID: FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/MMU/02/2).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197182917&doi=10.3390%2ff15060923&partnerID=40&md5=c0fc5522888c9a350d02d81fc1febe63,4.0,"Arif M., Alghamdi K.K., Sahel S.A., Alosaimi S.O., Alsahaft M.E., Alharthi M.A., Arif M., Role of Machine Learning Algorithms in Forest Fire Management: A Literature Review, J.

The framework is applicable globally, and the datasets generated are freely accessible and shareable. By implementing the framework in Peninsular Malaysia, significant forest fire factors were successfully extracted, including the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI), soil moisture, temperature, windspeed, land surface temperature (LST), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), landcover, and precipitation, among others. Additionally, this study also adopted large language models, specifically GPT-4 with the Noteable plugin, for preliminary data analysis to assess the dataset’s validity. Although the plugin effectively performed basic statistical analyses and visualizations, it demonstrated limitations, such as selectively dropping or choosing only relevant columns for tests and automatically modifying scales. These behaviors underscore the need for users to perform additional checks on the codes generated to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended analyses. The initial findings indicate that factors such as KBDI, LST, climate water deficit, and precipitation significantly impact forest fire occurrences in Peninsular Malaysia. Future research should explore extending the framework’s application to various regions and further refine it to accommodate a broader range of factors. Embracing and rigorously validating large language model technologies, alongside developing new tools and plugins, are essential for advancing the field of data analysis. © 2024 by the authors. 2024"

Mo G.; Xing Z.; Zhu Y.; Huang L.; Chen W.; Li J.,2025,17,3,,,"Traditional methods for assessing urban waterlogging hazards lack real-time efficiency. This study develops a rapid hazard assessment method for urban waterlogging events using social media data and large language models, with the urban waterlogging event in Guilin in 2024 as a case study. We constructed a keyword database for urban waterlogging, combined with web crawling techniques to collect related data from social media platforms. This study applied the BERT-BILSTM-CRF model, the GPT-3.5-turbo model, and the ERNIE-3.5-128K model to extract waterlogging locations, comparing them with the official waterlogging location data to validate and select the optimal model. The model was then used for urban waterlogging hazard assessment at the township scale. The results indicate that the establishment of a keyword database facilitates access to more social media data. The GPT-3.5-turbo model demonstrates superior performance in waterlogging location identification, with a coverage of 93% compared with the actual waterlogging locations, and an F1 score of 0.8066. During the Guilin 6.19 waterlogging, areas with high hazard intensities mainly concentrated in the city center; meanwhile, the hazard intensities of some townships in the suburbs intensified from 17 June to 21 June. This study validates the effectiveness and timeliness of using social media data and large language models for rapid hazard assessment of urban waterlogging events through practical cases, which can provide reliable support for future urban disaster prevention and reduction efforts. © 2025 by the authors.",20734441,10.3390/w17030354,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),large language models; social media; urban waterlogging,Social Media Data-Based Rapid Hazard Assessment of Urban Waterlogging Event: A Case Study of Guilin 6.19 Waterlogging,"National Institute of Natural Hazards, Ministry of Emergency Management of the People’s Republic of China, Beijing, 100085, China",,,"\u201CKey R&D Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region\u201D (Grant Number: 2024BEG01005) is funded by the Department of Science and Technology of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

This study develops a rapid hazard assessment method for urban waterlogging events using social media data and large language models, with the urban waterlogging event in Guilin in 2024 as a case study. We constructed a keyword database for urban waterlogging, combined with web crawling techniques to collect related data from social media platforms. This study applied the BERT-BILSTM-CRF model, the GPT-3.5-turbo model, and the ERNIE-3.5-128K model to extract waterlogging locations, comparing them with the official waterlogging location data to validate and select the optimal model. The model was then used for urban waterlogging hazard assessment at the township scale. The results indicate that the establishment of a keyword database facilitates access to more social media data. The GPT-3.5-turbo model demonstrates superior performance in waterlogging location identification, with a coverage of 93% compared with the actual waterlogging locations, and an F1 score of 0.8066. During the Guilin 6.19 waterlogging, areas with high hazard intensities mainly concentrated in the city center; meanwhile, the hazard intensities of some townships in the suburbs intensified from 17 June to 21 June. This study validates the effectiveness and timeliness of using social media data and large language models for rapid hazard assessment of urban waterlogging events through practical cases, which can provide reliable support for future urban disaster prevention and reduction efforts. © 2025 by the authors. 2025"
Jiang L.; Wen G.; Lu J.; Yang H.; Jin Y.; Nie X.; Wang Z.; Chen M.; Du Y.; Wang Y.,2024,946,,,,"As a terrestrial ecosystem, alpine grasslands feature diverse vegetation types and play key roles in regulating water resources and carbon storage, thus shaping global climate. The dynamics of soil nutrients in this ecosystem, responding to regional climate change, directly impact primary productivity. This review comprehensively explored the effects of climate change on soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and their balance in the alpine meadows, highlighting the significant roles these nutrients played in plant growth and species diversity. We also shed light on machine learning utilization in soil nutrient evaluation. As global warming continues, alongside shifting precipitation patterns, soil characteristics of grasslands, such as moisture and pH values vary significantly, further altering the availability and composition of soil nutrients. The rising air temperature in alpine regions substantially enhances the activity of soil organisms, accelerating nutrient mineralization and the decomposition of organic materials. Combined with varied nutrient input, such as increased N deposition, plant growth and species composition are changing. With the robust capacity to use and integrate diverse data sources, including satellite imagery, sensor-collected spectral data, camera-captured videos, and common knowledge-based text and audio, machine learning offers rapid and accurate assessments of the changes in soil nutrients and associated determinants, such as soil moisture. When combined with powerful large language models like ChatGPT, these tools provide invaluable insights and strategies for effective grassland management, aiming to foster a sustainable ecosystem that balances high productivity and advanced services with reduced environmental impacts. © 2024",00489697,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174295,Elsevier B.V.,Alpine grassland; Climate change; Machine learning; Soil nitrogen and phosphorus,Machine learning in soil nutrient dynamics of alpine grasslands,"State Key Laboratory of Tibetan Plateau Earth System, Environment and Resources (TPESER), Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Ottawa Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0C6, ON, Canada; China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Beijing, 100038, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Computer Programing, Algonquin College, Ottawa, K2G 1V8, ON, Canada; College of Life Sciences, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Key Laboratory of Adaptation and Evolution of Plateau Biota, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, 810008, China",,,"This study was financially supported in part by the Lhasa Key Science and Technology Project (LSKJ202425), Ali district Science and Technology Project (QYXTZX-AL2024-04), and Science and Technology Project of the Tibet Autonomous Region (QYXTZX-RKZ2024-02-1 and XZ202301ZY0003F).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197227821&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.174295&partnerID=40&md5=2fea6afa73a6a09e4fa9ce1804277c09,1.0,"Arpitha M., Ahmed S.A., Harishnaika N., Land use and land cover classification using machine learning algorithms in google earth engine, Earth.

The dynamics of soil nutrients in this ecosystem, responding to regional climate change, directly impact primary productivity. This review comprehensively explored the effects of climate change on soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and their balance in the alpine meadows, highlighting the significant roles these nutrients played in plant growth and species diversity. We also shed light on machine learning utilization in soil nutrient evaluation. As global warming continues, alongside shifting precipitation patterns, soil characteristics of grasslands, such as moisture and pH values vary significantly, further altering the availability and composition of soil nutrients. The rising air temperature in alpine regions substantially enhances the activity of soil organisms, accelerating nutrient mineralization and the decomposition of organic materials. Combined with varied nutrient input, such as increased N deposition, plant growth and species composition are changing. With the robust capacity to use and integrate diverse data sources, including satellite imagery, sensor-collected spectral data, camera-captured videos, and common knowledge-based text and audio, machine learning offers rapid and accurate assessments of the changes in soil nutrients and associated determinants, such as soil moisture. When combined with powerful large language models like ChatGPT, these tools provide invaluable insights and strategies for effective grassland management, aiming to foster a sustainable ecosystem that balances high productivity and advanced services with reduced environmental impacts. © 2024 2024"
Orozco López E.; Kaplan D.; Linhoss A.,2024,60,10,,,"Transformer neural networks (TNNs) have caused a paradigm shift in deep learning domains like natural language processing, gathering immense interest due to their versatility in other fields such as time series forecasting (TSF). Most current TSF applications of TNNs use only historic observations to predict future events, ignoring information available in weather forecasts to inform better predictions, and with little attention given to the interpretability of the model's use of explanatory inputs. This work explores the potential for TNNs to perform TSF across multiple environmental variables (streamflow, stage, water temperature, and salinity) in two ecologically important regions: the Peace River watershed (Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana). The TNN was tested and its prediction uncertainty quantified for each response variable from one-to fourteen-day-ahead forecasts using past observations and spatially distributed weather forecasts. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed on the trained TNNs' attention weights to identify the relative influence of each input variable on each response variable across prediction windows. Overall model performance ranged from good to very good (0.78 < NSE < 0.99 for all variables and forecast horizons). Through the SA, we found that the TNN was able to learn the physical patterns behind the data, adapt the use of input variables to each forecast, and increasingly use weather forecast information as prediction windows increased. The TNN's excellent performance and flexibility, along with the intuitive interpretability highlighting the logic behind the models' forecasting decision-making process, provide evidence for the applicability of this architecture to other TSF variables and locations. © 2024.

The system prioritizes collaboration with interested parties in three pilot watersheds with test cases implemented in US locations including Iowa, Tampa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The BlueGAP IS leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with large language models based on regional nutrient management issues and community knowledge to provide access to water quality information. The current focus of the system is on nitrate in drinking water, rivers, and waterways, and can be expanded to incorporate other water quality information. BlueGAP identifies possible partnerships and promotes collaborations among diverse stakeholders to facilitate effective evaluation of nitrogen-related analytes, guide action to address possible pollution, and outline sustainable water management practices. The BlueGAP IS also emphasizes its educational mission by connecting water quality data with inclusive and accessible educational content through AI technology. By integrating nitrogen data and water quality issues into educational resources, BlueGAP fosters a deeper understanding of water quality issues across diverse communities, empowering users to make informed decisions and contribute to sustainable water management practices. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd 2025"
Mei K.; Shi H.; Wu Y.; Dahlgren R.A.; Ji X.; Yang M.; Guan Y.,2025,170,,,,"Urban river water pollution is a serious environmental challenge confronting urban areas worldwide. The scientific quantification of the impact of landscape patterns on water quality provides essential support for pollution control and watershed landscape optimization. In this study, we onducted an in-depth and meticulous exploration of the relationship between the landscape patterns and water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed at four distinct spatial scales (single subwatershed, dynamic subwatershed, riparian buffer, and reach buffer) and two time scales (dry season and rainy season). Regression models were used to investigate the quantitative impact of landscape patterns on water quality, redundancy analysis was employed to assess the overall explanatory power, and non-parametric point-of-change analysis was applied to evaluate variations in water quality along landscape gradients and identify critical landscape threshold ranges. The results indicate that the model performance of disolved oxygen at the reach buffer scale, pH and total nitrogen at the riparian buffer scale, and ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total phosphorus at the dynamic subwatershed scale were better than at other scales. Overall, the dynamic subwatershed scale showed the strongest explanatory power for water quality indicators, with 91.2 % for the rainy season and 83.2 % for the dry season. The largest patch index of agricultural land (A_LPI) and water bodies (W_LPI) were identified as the most critical landscape indices influencing water quality at the dynamic sub-watershed scale, with threshold values for these indices established as A_LPI < 10 % and W_LPI > 1.5 %. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal impacts of landscape patterns on water quality and offer valuable insights for watershed management and ecological planning. © 2024 The Authors",1470160X,10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.113019,Elsevier B.V.,Geographically weighted regression model (GWR); Landscape patterns; Redundancy analysis (RDA); Scale effects; Stepwise multiple linear regression model (SMLR); Water quality mutation points,Impact of landscape patterns on river water quality: Spatial-scale effects across an agricultural-urban interface,"SuZhou Key Laboratory of Spatial Information Intelligent Technology and Application, School of Geography Science and Geomatics Engineering, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Suzhou, 215009, China; Southern Zhejiang Water Research Institute (iWATER), Wenzhou, 325035, China; School of Environment Science and Engineering, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Suzhou, 215009, China; Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, 95616, CA, United States; School of Public Health and Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China",,,"Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41807495, 51979197) and the Science and Technology Project Funding of Wenzhou City (No. S2020001). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41807495, 51979197) and Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau (No. S2020001).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212587424&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2024.113019&partnerID=40&md5=2195a19983054139db36a59ad8808d8d,8.0,"Biau G., Scornet E., A random forest guided tour, Test, 25, pp. 197-227, (2016); Chen Q., Mei K., Dahlgren R.A., Wang T., Gong J., Zhang M., Impacts of land use and population density on seasonal surface water quality using a modified geographically weighted regression, Sci.

Guan Y.; Wang D.; Chu Z.; Wang S.; Ni F.; Song R.; Zhuang C.,2024,,,5018,5027,"While intelligent virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become ubiquitous in modern life, they still face limitations in their ability to follow multi-step instructions and accomplish complex goals articulated in natural language. However, recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) show promise for overcoming existing barriers by enhancing natural language processing and reasoning capabilities. Though promising, applying LLMs to create more advanced virtual assistants still faces challenges like ensuring robust performance and handling variability in real-world user commands. This paper proposes a novel LLM-based virtual assistant that can automatically perform multi-step operations within mobile apps based on high-level user requests. The system represents an advance in assistants by providing an end-to-end solution for parsing instructions, reasoning about goals, and executing actions. LLM-based Process Automation (LLMPA) has modules for decomposing instructions, generating descriptions, detecting interface elements, predicting next actions, and error checking. Experiments demonstrate the system completing complex mobile operation tasks in Alipay based on natural language instructions. This showcases how large language models can enable automated assistants to accomplish real-world tasks. The main contributions are the novel LLMPA architecture optimized for app process automation, the methodology for applying LLMs to mobile apps, and demonstrations of multi-step task completion in a real-world environment. Notably, this work represents the first real-world deployment and extensive evaluation of a large language model-based virtual assistant in a widely used mobile application with an enormous user base numbering in the hundreds of millions.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Sela L.; Sowby R.B.; Salomons E.; Housh M.,2025,272,,,,"Water utilities facing increasingly complex infrastructure and operations stand to significantly benefit from artificial intelligence (AI). Current research in water distribution systems engineering primarily focuses on Specialized AI, which plays a crucial role in processing extensive datasets, identifying patterns, and extracting actionable insights to improve the resilience and efficiency of water utility operations. However, barriers of usability, accessibility, and trainability hinder broader adoption. As AI technology evolves, Generative AI is emerging as a game changer by enabling intuitive, natural language interactions with complex systems, thereby making AI more accessible. This paper explores emerging AI topics, examines key challenges in deploying AI-based tools, highlights new opportunities, and presents practical examples of AI integration in water system operations: missing data imputation, asset data processing, and water demand analysis. It also identifies critical aspects that the water research community must prioritize to advance water system research into the AI era, including promoting responsible and user-centered AI solutions, building trust in technology, integrating AI into existing workflows, enhancing data privacy and security, and strengthening partnerships. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",00431354,10.1016/j.watres.2024.122935,Elsevier Ltd,Artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Software democratization; Water utilities operations,Making waves: The potential of generative AI in water utility operations,"Maseeh Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, United States; Department of Civil and Construction Engineering, Brigham Young University, United States; School of Environmental Sciences, University of Haifa, Israel",,,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant 1943428 and by the Ministry of Innovation, Science & Technology, Israel, under Grant 1001577561.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211744533&doi=10.1016%2fj.watres.2024.122935&partnerID=40&md5=689a88e54165a0b0974fb517285f2606,4.0,"Abbott M., Cohen B., Structural reform and productivity in the water and wastewater industry: emerging issues, Water Resour.

By adjusting the polarization state, the evolution phenomenon of soliton rain pulse and the NLP are obtained. The typical NLP mode-locking operation regime is achieved by finely adjusting pump power and polarization state, which delivers a corresponding pulse energy of 8.93 nJ with pulse width of 1.31 ps. The soliton rain operation regime with multiple solitons is achieved by finely adjusting pump power, which delivers a corresponding pulse energy of 22.98 nJ with pulse width of 1.21 ps. In addition, a NLP mode-locking operation regime is obtained again under a proper pump power and polarization state with a corresponding pulse energy of 34.14 nJ and pulse width of 1.18 ps.

By adjusting the polarization state, the evolution phenomenon of soliton rain pulse and the NLP are obtained. The typical NLP mode-locking operation regime is achieved by finely adjusting pump power and polarization state, which delivers a corresponding pulse energy of 8.93 nJ with pulse width of 1.31 ps. The soliton rain operation regime with multiple solitons is achieved by finely adjusting pump power, which delivers a corresponding pulse energy of 22.98 nJ with pulse width of 1.21 ps. In addition, a NLP mode-locking operation regime is obtained again under a proper pump power and polarization state with a corresponding pulse energy of 34.14 nJ and pulse width of 1.18 ps. The experimental results well demonstrate the evolution of ultrashort pulse regime with the pump power and polarization state in passively mode-locked Ho-doped fiber lasers at 2 μm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd 2022"
Huang H.; Chen M.; Zhang Y.; Wang X.; Xie Q.; Pu Y.; He Y.; Zhu L.; He Y.; Guo J.,2025,41,2,1400,1410,"The growing demand for energy storage batteries, driven by the need to alleviate global warming and reduce fossil fuel dependency, has led to environmental concerns surrounding spent batteries. Efficient recycling of these batteries is essential to prevent pollution and recover valuable metal ions such as nickel (Ni2+), cobalt (Co2+), and manganese (Mn2+). Conventional hydrometallurgical methods for battery recycling, while effective, often involve harmful chemicals and processes. Natural polyphenols offer a greener alternative due to their ability to coordinate with metal ions. However, optimizing polyphenol selection for efficient recovery remains a labor-intensive challenge. This study presents a strategy combining natural polyphenols as green precipitants with the power of GPT-4, a large language model (LLM), to enhance the precipitation and recovery of metal ions from spent batteries. By leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4 in natural language processing, we enable a dynamic, iterative collaboration between human researchers and the LLM, optimizing polyphenol selection for different experimental conditions. The results show that tannic acid achieved precipitation rates of 94.8, 96.7, and 96.7% for Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, respectively, outperforming conventional methods. The integration of GPT-4 enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of the process, ensuring environmental sustainability by minimizing secondary pollution and utilizing biodegradable materials. This innovative strategy demonstrates the potential of combining artificial intelligence-driven analysis with green chemistry to address battery recycling challenges, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient methods. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",07437463,10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c04262,American Chemical Society,,Large Language Modeling to Assist Natural Polyphenols as Green Precipitants for Recycling Spent Batteries,"BMI Center for Biomass Materials and Nanointerfaces, National Engineering Laboratory for Clean Technology of Leather Manufacture, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Leather Chemistry and Engineering, College of Biomass Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, 610065, China; China CEC Engineering Corporation, Hunan, Changsha, 410114, China; State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, 610065, China; Bioproducts Institute, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6T 1Z4, BC, Canada",,,"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFA0912800), National Excellent Young Scientists Fund (00308054A1045), National Natural Science Foundation of China (22178233, 22108181, 22408241), Talents Program of Sichuan Province, Double First Class University Plan of Sichuan University, State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering (sklpme 2020-03-01), Sichuan Tianfu Emei Project (2022-EC02-00073-CG), Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2022YFN0070).

However, identifying meaningful and cutting-edge research topics is a significant challenge, as it requires a thorough understanding of existing literature and the ability to discern knowledge gaps. Traditional bibliometrics often fall short of capturing nascent interdisciplinary fields. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer potential solutions to this challenge. This study explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in identifying and analyzing emerging research opportunities in environmental science. We employ a text retrieval method based on word embeddings, utilizing the emergent reasoning abilities of LLMs combined with embedded search techniques to dynamically integrate the latest literature. By comparing the GPT-3.5 API with supplementary literature, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, we find that the GPT-3.5 API provides a more comprehensive, detailed, and current analysis of cutting-edge environmental science, emphasizing the importance of understanding the dynamics and timeliness of the field. Our findings underscore the critical role of interdisciplinary research, AI, and big data in addressing urgent environmental challenges. LLMs can serve as valuable tools for researchers, offering guidance and inspiration for future directions in environmental science research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd 2025"
Kang C.; Wu S.; Gul E.; Yu X.; Ren P.,2022,17,,540,549,"The scheduling and optimization of short-term hydrothermal operation utilize the water resources efficiently and magnify the benefits of hydro energy while reducing the fuel and operation cost of thermal power plants. Short-term hydrothermal operation is a complex non-linear and non-convex optimization problem, which reflects thermal valve point effects, load balances, generation bounds and water transport delay. It is highly important and significant to figure out these problems to maximize the benefits of hydrothermal joint operation for energy saving, emission reduction and efficient resources management. This article presents a 1D linearization technique to deal with the non-linear function of two variables, a combined mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and non-linear programming (NLP) method to solve this problem. The applied method introduces integer variables to linearize the original model into a MILP one; the solution by MILP is then corrected and re-optimized to formulate a feasible solution to warm start NLP. The 1D linearization method is efficient for MILP as it avoids the coupled relationships of integer variables, and the NLP local search is used to correct the influence of linearization errors and search further. The case studies show that the result derived by the 1D linearization-based MILP-NLP method is superior to that of previous works. The method is tested with different linearization accuracy, and the results demonstrate that the method is stable. The presented technique is promising for real-world hydrothermal operation and related problems.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Zhou Y.; Liu P.,2024,19,12,,,"Each year, tropical cyclones (TCs) cause significant damage to both society and the environment through multiple hazards. While extensive research has focused on individual TC primary hazards, there is a gap in the comprehensive assessment of multiple TC-related hazards using a large number of TCs, likely due to limitations in methodology and data when identifying complex hazard interrelationships. To address this challenge, we developed novel methods using a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract TC-related weather-hazardous events from official hazard records, of which narratives provide detailed characterization of TC multi-hazard interrelationships. We applied this method on TCs originating from the North Atlantic and East Pacific Oceans affecting the Contiguous United States. The results showed that the NLP methods, especially the large language models, can identify TC names from the texts with reasonable precision. A total of 21 488 events related to 179 TCs were identified from 2007 to 2022. These events encompassed 31 types of hazards, with precipitation and flooding being the most frequent and causing the most direct fatalities, while wind hazards cause the most direct property damage. Although TC wind and storm surges are typically concentrated within 100-200 km of the storm track, hazards can occur hundreds of kilometers away and even after the storm’s dissipation. During this period, 2033 counties experienced at least one TC-related event, impacting not only the eastern seaboard but also inland areas in central and southwestern regions. These findings underscore the importance of a multi-hazard perspective on TCs, enhancing hazard awareness and informing decision-making. © 2024 The Author(s).

While extensive research has focused on individual TC primary hazards, there is a gap in the comprehensive assessment of multiple TC-related hazards using a large number of TCs, likely due to limitations in methodology and data when identifying complex hazard interrelationships. To address this challenge, we developed novel methods using a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract TC-related weather-hazardous events from official hazard records, of which narratives provide detailed characterization of TC multi-hazard interrelationships. We applied this method on TCs originating from the North Atlantic and East Pacific Oceans affecting the Contiguous United States. The results showed that the NLP methods, especially the large language models, can identify TC names from the texts with reasonable precision. A total of 21 488 events related to 179 TCs were identified from 2007 to 2022. These events encompassed 31 types of hazards, with precipitation and flooding being the most frequent and causing the most direct fatalities, while wind hazards cause the most direct property damage. Although TC wind and storm surges are typically concentrated within 100-200 km of the storm track, hazards can occur hundreds of kilometers away and even after the storm’s dissipation. During this period, 2033 counties experienced at least one TC-related event, impacting not only the eastern seaboard but also inland areas in central and southwestern regions. These findings underscore the importance of a multi-hazard perspective on TCs, enhancing hazard awareness and informing decision-making. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. 2024"
Yi X.; Liu S.,2021,195,,,,"In the present paper, an association between the growth rate of PTB and the environmental impacting elements in the pearl river delta region and the closed industry related cities in China is studied. We summarized the characteristics of different industry characteristics in this region by three echelons of urban agglomerations conducted by K-means clustering model on the time series of their monthly AQI data. To determine the impact of environmental factors on the increase of PTB, the SMLR in GLM has been applied. We then measured the seasonal effect and suggest the spring to be the leading season which keep the highest possibility of the incidence of PTB. Besides giving the analysis by fixed meteorological factors, we presented a sensitive analysis with a variation of precipitation. The Genetic algorithms (GAs) is used to determine the “tolerant” interval and as the results, the width of “tolerant” almost keep a declining trend as the precipitation increasing except when the precipitation comes the interval [68,74]. In addition, with the precipitation increasing higher than 64 mm, the “tolerant” for the AQI values from the first and the second echelon both trend to decline, and a lenient environmental policy currently may easily cause a rapid development of PTB growth rate. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",00139351,10.1016/j.envres.2021.110768,Academic Press Inc.,Environmental factors; GAs; PTB; SMLR,Impact of environmental factors on pulmonary tuberculosis in multi-levels industrial upgrading area of China,"Business School, City College of Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523419, China; Public Health School, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, 510006, China",,,"We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Dongguan Institute of Technology City College (Major research and cultivation project 2020, 2020YZDYB06R).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100698670&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2021.110768&partnerID=40&md5=5488376da12cf90957459200ac073fb9,6.0,"Ahmadi M., Sharifi A., Dorosti S., Ghoushchi S.J., Ghanbari N., Investigation of effective climatology parameters on COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, Sci.

One critical design consideration for many heat-treatable alloys deriving superior properties from precipitation are phases as key microstructure constituents because they can have a decisive impact on the engineering properties of alloys. Here, we present a computational framework for high-throughput extraction of phases and their impact on properties from scientific papers. Our framework includes transformer-based and large language models to identify sentences with phase-property information in papers, recognize phase and property entities, and extract phase-property relationships and their “sentiment.” We demonstrate the application of our framework on aluminum alloys, for which we build a database of 7,675 phase–property relationships extracted from a corpus of almost 5000 full-text papers.

One critical design consideration for many heat-treatable alloys deriving superior properties from precipitation are phases as key microstructure constituents because they can have a decisive impact on the engineering properties of alloys. Here, we present a computational framework for high-throughput extraction of phases and their impact on properties from scientific papers. Our framework includes transformer-based and large language models to identify sentences with phase-property information in papers, recognize phase and property entities, and extract phase-property relationships and their “sentiment.” We demonstrate the application of our framework on aluminum alloys, for which we build a database of 7,675 phase–property relationships extracted from a corpus of almost 5000 full-text papers. We comment on the extracted relationships based on common metallurgical knowledge. © The Author(s) 2024. 2024"
Qiu J.; Wang H.; Shen W.; Zhang Y.; Su H.; Li M.,2021,13,4,1,17,"Many post-fire on-site factors, including fire severity, management strategies, topography, and local climate, are concerns for forest managers and recovery ecologists to formulate forest vegetation recovery plans in response to climate change. We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance in the Daxing’anling area, Northeastern China, from 1987 to 2016. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier and historical fire records were used to separate burned patches from disturbance patches obtained from VCT. Afterward, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), SVM, and random forest (RF) were applied to assess the statistical relationships between vegetation recovery characteristics and various influential factors. The results indicated that the forest disturbance events obtained from VCT had high spatial accuracy, ranging from 70% to 86% for most years. The overall accuracy of the annual fire patches extracted from the proposed VCT-SVM algorithm was over 92%. The modeling accuracy of post-fire vegetation recovery was excellent, and the validation results confirmed that the RF algorithm provided better prediction accuracy than SVM and SMLR. In conclusion, topographic variables (e.g., elevation) and meteorological variables (e.g., the post-fire annual precipitation in the second year, the post-fire average relative humidity in the fifth year, and the post-fire extreme maximum temperature in the third year) jointly affect vegetation recovery in this cold temperate continental monsoon climate region.

We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance in the Daxing’anling area, Northeastern China, from 1987 to 2016. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier and historical fire records were used to separate burned patches from disturbance patches obtained from VCT. Afterward, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), SVM, and random forest (RF) were applied to assess the statistical relationships between vegetation recovery characteristics and various influential factors. The results indicated that the forest disturbance events obtained from VCT had high spatial accuracy, ranging from 70% to 86% for most years. The overall accuracy of the annual fire patches extracted from the proposed VCT-SVM algorithm was over 92%. The modeling accuracy of post-fire vegetation recovery was excellent, and the validation results confirmed that the RF algorithm provided better prediction accuracy than SVM and SMLR. In conclusion, topographic variables (e.g., elevation) and meteorological variables (e.g., the post-fire annual precipitation in the second year, the post-fire average relative humidity in the fifth year, and the post-fire extreme maximum temperature in the third year) jointly affect vegetation recovery in this cold temperate continental monsoon climate region.

Li D.; Marshall L.; Liang Z.; Sharma A.; Zhou Y.,2021,57,9,,,"Significant attention has recently been paid to deep learning as a method for improved catchment modeling. Compared with process-based models, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of interpretability. One solution is to combine a process-based hydrological model with a residual error model based on deep learning to give full scope to their respective advantages. In classical residual error models, Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is commonly used to provide an estimation of the uncertainty. However, deep neural networks tend to have excessively large numbers of parameters, making MCMC an unsuitable approach. Here, we introduce an alternative to Bayesian MCMC sampling called stochastic variational inference (SVI) which has recently been developed for Bayesian deep learning in Natural Language Processing. We implement SVI in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and construct residual error models in process-based hydrological models. This approach is examined in the contrasting geographical and climatic characteristics of two catchments from China, the Tangnaihai catchment and the Shiquan catchment. Compared with the Bayesian linear regression model, the Bayesian LSTM provides better uncertainty estimates. Specifically, the proposed method improves the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by over 10% in both two catchments. In the Tangnaihai catchment, it provides more than 10% narrower uncertainty intervals in terms of Sharpness with slightly superior Reliability. In the Shiquan catchment, it provides comparable uncertainty intervals with better Reliability. Further, our study highlights the scalability of SVI to high-dimensional parameter spaces in hydrological applications (e.g., distributed hydrological models, groundwater models). © 2021.

Chen B.; Nakamura Y.; Fukushima S.; Arakawa Y.,2024,36,10,4549,4566,"Dense video captioning aims to extract every goal event and its corresponding period, and has gathered significant attention owing to its potential and valuable applications in smart homes, human care, security monitoring, and more. However, current methods do not sufficiently reduce ambiguity in the generated captions and have a limited field of view, making it difficult to integrate the relationship between people and their surrounding environment into the captions. The limitations restrict their applicability in smart home or indoor security systems. These systems require clear distinctions between normal and abnormal human actions, as similar actions can have different interpretations depending on the surrounding environment. For instance, in indoor security systems, ambiguous captions might fail to distinguish between harmless activities such as a person walking and potentially concerning behaviors such as unauthorized access attempts. In this article, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system to enhance existing methods, making them suitable for recording human activity indoors. Our key ideas are as follows. First, we collect information about the house environment using a 3D reconstruction and 3D detection process to build a knowledge base. Second, we design a RAG procedure to extract the relevant environmental context. Third, we develop a spatial information enhancement query based on human detection results from RGB and depth image pairs. We utilize the summarization and reasoning capabilities of a large language model to fuse all information, thereby obtaining spatially enhanced dense captions of human indoor activities. We evaluate our method by comparing it with PDVC (end-to-end Dense Video Captioning with Parallel Decoding), GVL (Learning Grounded Vision-Language Representation for Versatile Understanding in Untrimmed Videos), and SG-PDVC (Scene Graph-enhanced PDVC) on a custom video dataset collected from two houses with eight different camera positions, using Recall, Precision, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering (METEOR), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation (CIDEr) as metrics. Our method outperforms the three compared methods in BLEU-3, METEOR, CIDEr, and Precision metrics, but shows a small decline in ROUGE-L and Recall metrics compared with GVL. These results demonstrate that our method effectively incorporates spatial information and reduces ambiguity for indoor human activity caption applications. © MYU K.K.",09144935,10.18494/SAM5238,M Y U Scientific Publishing Division,3D detection; 3D reconstruction; dense video caption; depth camera; human activity recognition; large language model; retrieval-augmented generation,Retrieval-augmented-generation-enhanced Dense Video Caption for Human Indoor Activities: Disambiguating Caption Using Spatial Information Beyond Field of View Constraints,"Graduate School, Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan",,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207959348&doi=10.18494%2fSAM5238&partnerID=40&md5=124808a6efa813fcffcbbcd6bc8fbbcc,0.0,"Iashin V., Rahtu E., Proc.

However, current methods do not sufficiently reduce ambiguity in the generated captions and have a limited field of view, making it difficult to integrate the relationship between people and their surrounding environment into the captions. The limitations restrict their applicability in smart home or indoor security systems. These systems require clear distinctions between normal and abnormal human actions, as similar actions can have different interpretations depending on the surrounding environment. For instance, in indoor security systems, ambiguous captions might fail to distinguish between harmless activities such as a person walking and potentially concerning behaviors such as unauthorized access attempts.

Ghamarpoor R.; Jamshidi M.; Fallah A.; Eftekharipour F.,2023,342,,,,"Organic pollutants are the most critical threats to the health of air and water resources. On this basis, fabricating a photocatalytic acrylic film with dual-use (i.e. removing benzene from air and MB/MO dyes from water) was aimed in this research. For this purpose, waste warm filter cake (WWFC) was used to extract zinc from it. Zinc element was separated from WWFC by a basic leaching method and acidified to prepare zinc oxide nanoparticles. In the following, a simple hydrothermal method was used to increase the surface functionality of the extracted ZnO nanoparticles in order to establish active reaction sites for reaction to silane coupling agent and increase in the holes that were prepared during photo-excitation. Thereafter, the nanoparticles were modified with 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane (GPTES) at different concentrations. The band gap of the modified nanoparticles decreased from 3.25 to 3.1 eV by surface modification. The photocatalytic performance of ZnO nanoparticles was assessed by degradation of MB and MO aqueous solution (50 ppm) under simulated UV/Visible irradiations. MB and MO were degraded 91 and 60% under UV light and 65 and 50% under visible light after 150 min of irradiation. The photo degradation rate increased after adding carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) surfactant to methylene blue and adding cocamide-dea (CDE-G) surfactant to methyl orange. The results confirmed that the green surfactants improve the dispersion and surface interaction of the modified nanoparticles in the dyes solution and cause more electron charge transfer which creates effective photocatalytic sites. The prepared nanocomposite films were placed in a photo-reactor to remove gaseous benzene from air under UV/visible irradiation. Gas chromatography (GC) results showed that the modified nanoparticles removed up to 35.25 and 20.34% of benzene from air. Colorimetric analysis (ΔE*) showed that the acrylic film contained modified nanoparticles degraded 91 and 82% of MB, and 85 and 76% of MO under UV/visible lights, respectively. In the end, it can be said that these photocatalytic films are able to remove environmental pollution in air and water. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",03014797,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118352,Academic Press,3-Glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane; Air-water purification; Benzene removal; Dye removal; Photocatalytic films; Waste warm filter cake; ZnO nanoparticles,Preparation of dual-use GPTES@ZnO photocatalyst from waste warm filter cake and evaluation of its synergic photocatalytic degradation for air-water purification,"Constructional Polymers and Composites Research Lab., School of Chemical, Petroleum and Gas Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran; Department of Chemical Technologies, Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), Tehran, Iran",,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161719795&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2023.118352&partnerID=40&md5=b07b7957ab1c307cb24e5a5774ebc96d,77.0,"Ajma Z., ul Haq M., Naciri Y., Djellabi R., Hassan N., Zaman S., Et al., Recent advancement in conjugated polymers based photocatalytic technology for air pollutants abatement: cases of CO2, NOx, and VOCs, Chemosphere, (2022); Alamgholiloo H., Nazari S., Asgari E., Sheikhmohammadi A., Hashemzadeh B., Ghasemian N., Et al., Facile fabrication of Z-scheme TiO2/ZnO@ MCM-41 heterojunctions nanostructures for photodegradation and bioactivity performance, J.

On this basis, fabricating a photocatalytic acrylic film with dual-use (i.e. removing benzene from air and MB/MO dyes from water) was aimed in this research. For this purpose, waste warm filter cake (WWFC) was used to extract zinc from it. Zinc element was separated from WWFC by a basic leaching method and acidified to prepare zinc oxide nanoparticles. In the following, a simple hydrothermal method was used to increase the surface functionality of the extracted ZnO nanoparticles in order to establish active reaction sites for reaction to silane coupling agent and increase in the holes that were prepared during photo-excitation. Thereafter, the nanoparticles were modified with 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane (GPTES) at different concentrations. The band gap of the modified nanoparticles decreased from 3.25 to 3.1 eV by surface modification. The photocatalytic performance of ZnO nanoparticles was assessed by degradation of MB and MO aqueous solution (50 ppm) under simulated UV/Visible irradiations. MB and MO were degraded 91 and 60% under UV light and 65 and 50% under visible light after 150 min of irradiation. The photo degradation rate increased after adding carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) surfactant to methylene blue and adding cocamide-dea (CDE-G) surfactant to methyl orange. The results confirmed that the green surfactants improve the dispersion and surface interaction of the modified nanoparticles in the dyes solution and cause more electron charge transfer which creates effective photocatalytic sites. The prepared nanocomposite films were placed in a photo-reactor to remove gaseous benzene from air under UV/visible irradiation. Gas chromatography (GC) results showed that the modified nanoparticles removed up to 35.25 and 20.34% of benzene from air. Colorimetric analysis (ΔE*) showed that the acrylic film contained modified nanoparticles degraded 91 and 82% of MB, and 85 and 76% of MO under UV/visible lights, respectively. In the end, it can be said that these photocatalytic films are able to remove environmental pollution in air and water. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd 2023"
Li R.; Zhao L.; Xie Z.; Ji C.; Mo J.; Yang Z.; Feng Y.,2025,26,1,,,"Natural disasters have caused significant economic losses and casualties. Obtaining detailed disaster information and understanding public opinion during disasters are crucial for devising effective policies and ensuring timely disaster responses. With the widespread use of social media, it has become an important channel for extracting disaster information. However, accurately obtaining and revealing public opinion from social media remains challenging. This study combines the biterm topic model and support vector machine to analyze topic features. Additionally, sentiment features are analyzed using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3.5 model. These techniques are employed to build a social media-based flood information mining model capable of detecting the spatiotemporal distribution of public sentiment and discussion topics, including significant events impacting public sentiment. Using the 2022 Yingde flood as a case study, we explored the evolutionary patterns of public opinion on floods across three dimensions: time, space, and content. The study also explored the correlation between flooding and public opinion through geographic visualization and statistical analysis. The results indicated a precision of 89.2% and 80.2% for topic and sentiment classification, respectively. Temporally, the public response to flooding was primarily concentrated during heavy rainfall and flooding, varying with disaster severity. Furthermore, significant events or statements by public figures can greatly influence public responses to flooding. Spatially, the public response to flooding focused mainly in major urban areas and severely affected regions. In terms of content, a strong correlation was revealed between sentiments, topic distribution, and the disaster scenario. The findings can be used to analyze disaster conditions and public opinion in depth, and as a supplement of existing methods of extracting disaster information, it can enhance situational awareness for disaster emergency management and provide a reference basis for emergency relief efforts. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",15276988,10.1061/NHREFO.NHENG-2107,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),Emergency Management; Generative pretrained transformer; Natural disaster; Natural language processing; Public opinion; Social media,Mining and Analyzing the Evolution of Public Opinion in Extreme Disaster Events from Social Media: A Case Study of the 2022 Yingde Flood in China,"Institute of International River and Eco-Security, Yunnan Univ., Kunming, Yunnan, 650091, China; Kunming Surveying and Mapping Management Center, Administrative Centre, Building 2, Chenggong District, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China; School of Earth Sciences, Yunnan Univ., Kunming, Yunnan, 650091, China; Yunnan Institute of Tropical Crops, No. 99, Xuanwei Ave., Jinghong, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, 666100, China",,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205420589&doi=10.1061%2fNHREFO.NHENG-2107&partnerID=40&md5=5d9f40fb67965609cfa35979a28a954c,4.0,"Ahmad M., Aftab S., Ali I., Sentiment analysis of tweets using SVM, Int.

Bavya S.; Priyadharshini S.M.,2025,1399 LNNS,,226,235,"This research investigates gender norms in the classic Grimm’s fairy tale ‘‘Snow White’’ and its contemporary adaptation, ‘‘Snow White and the Huntsman,’’ utilizing advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By meticulously annotating and computationally analyzing textual data, the study identifies nuanced shifts in character dynamics, thematic emphases, and narrative structures between the traditional tale and its modern retelling. The comparative analysis reveals how the original ‘‘Snow White’’ perpetuates stereotypical gender norms, with female characters often depicted as passive and reliant on male saviors [1]. In contrast, the modern adaptation challenges these conventions by portraying empowered female protagonists who exert greater agency and leadership [2]. The study also examines how narrative trajectories and character interactions evolve to reflect changing societal values regarding gender roles. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of gender norms in children’s literature, highlighting the role of contemporary adaptations in reshaping traditional narratives to promote gender equality. Furthermore, the research demonstrates the potential of AI-driven analysis in literary studies, offering a precise and objective approach to exploring complex cultural phenomena.

Sugino H.; Sekiguchi T.; Terada Y.; Hayashi N.,2023,15,13,,,"Coastal social–ecological systems (SES), particularly in large bays, are critical for fisheries, transportation, and disaster prevention in island and coastal countries. To achieve the sustainability of such bays, public involvement is recently considered inevitable for planning and management, but the increasing complexity of variables and future visions to be considered is one difficulty when trying to include many stakeholders and public opinions. To address this challenge, a free-associative description questionnaire survey was used in this study to extract holistic coastal residents’ future visions for Tokyo Bay, including both positive and negative outcomes. By integrating biterm topic modeling (BTM) and multiple-factor analysis (MFA), this study succeeded to aggregate and visualize the various future visions of Tokyo Bay with enhanced comprehensibility. As one outcome, the linkages and differences between the major topics in the positive and negative future visions were visualized as vectors in a correlation circle. Also, the study found that these two kinds of future vectors are not always polar opposites, but, rather, some of them are interlinked, pointing in the same direction. This highlights the importance of measuring the balance between two kinds of future vectors in consensus-building in order to search for the optimal future direction. Finally, the study discusses the potential of this method as a “Future Compass”, for implementing future-oriented consensus-building toward the sustainability of SES. © 2023 by the authors.",20711050,10.3390/su151310175,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),biterm topic model (BTM); consensus-building; future vision; multiple-factor analysis (MFA); natural language processing (NLP); Tokyo Bay,"“Future Compass”, a Tool That Allows Us to See the Right Horizon—Integration of Topic Modeling and Multiple-Factor Analysis","Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan; Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University, Kyoto, 606-0823, Japan; Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan; Institute of Human and Social Sciences, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, 920-1192, Japan",,,This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI grant number 19K15894 “Elucidation of the Actual Condition of Balanced Harvesting Performed by Small-scale Fisheries in Japan and its Application to Sustainable Fisheries” and grant number 21H04738 “Study on the Multiple Values of Fishery Products”.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164967922&doi=10.3390%2fsu151310175&partnerID=40&md5=bdd929afeb9aa943a5080e397d150123,1.0,"Barbier E.B., Progress and Challenges in Valuing Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Services, Rev.

Malahayati S.P.; Farda N.M.; Berlyanti M.C.,2024,12977,,,,"Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, experiences frequent flooding every year. In the event of natural disasters such as floods, the government is obliged to implement a series of disaster emergency responses, including disaster modeling. Disaster modeling can be done using various data sources, but field survey data sources, remote sensing, and aerial photographs are considered less efficient. Field surveys take longer, while remote sensing and aerial photography are limited during the rainy season due to high cloud intensity. Currently, social media, particularly Twitter, is receiving significant attention from various groups as a data source for flood modeling. This research aims to construct a spatial database, conduct flood modeling, assess achieved accuracy levels, and examine tweet data in relation to rain events in Jakarta. The Kernel-Based Flood Mapping Model method is used for flood modeling, which utilizes DEMNAS data, river distribution data, administrative boundaries, water depth data at each river floodgate, tweet data, BPBD flood area maps, and surface observation rainfall data provided by BMKG. The accuracy of the flood modeling results was assessed using the overall accuracy method against all the obtained tweet data and BPBD flood area maps. A regression test was conducted to determine the relationship between rainfall and tweet data related to flooding in Jakarta. The results showed that out of 12,345 tweets, 149 could be compiled into a database for modeling. The flood modeling results indicate an accuracy rate of 70% based on the total flood points and 57% based on BPBD flood zones, which are considered low.

In the event of natural disasters such as floods, the government is obliged to implement a series of disaster emergency responses, including disaster modeling. Disaster modeling can be done using various data sources, but field survey data sources, remote sensing, and aerial photographs are considered less efficient. Field surveys take longer, while remote sensing and aerial photography are limited during the rainy season due to high cloud intensity. Currently, social media, particularly Twitter, is receiving significant attention from various groups as a data source for flood modeling. This research aims to construct a spatial database, conduct flood modeling, assess achieved accuracy levels, and examine tweet data in relation to rain events in Jakarta. The Kernel-Based Flood Mapping Model method is used for flood modeling, which utilizes DEMNAS data, river distribution data, administrative boundaries, water depth data at each river floodgate, tweet data, BPBD flood area maps, and surface observation rainfall data provided by BMKG. The accuracy of the flood modeling results was assessed using the overall accuracy method against all the obtained tweet data and BPBD flood area maps. A regression test was conducted to determine the relationship between rainfall and tweet data related to flooding in Jakarta. The results showed that out of 12,345 tweets, 149 could be compiled into a database for modeling. The flood modeling results indicate an accuracy rate of 70% based on the total flood points and 57% based on BPBD flood zones, which are considered low. The regression test indicates that there is no significant relationship between flood points and January rainfall data. The regression test values for rainfall at the flood location and the number of tweets is 0.020822 and for flood depth is 0.049214. This suggests that the rainfall variable has only a 2% effect on the number of tweets and a 4.9% effect on the depth of the flood, with other factors influencing the remainder. © 2024 SPIE. 2024"
Desale R.P.; Patil P.S.,2024,62,3,773,789,"Skin cancer is a pervasive and deadly disease, prompting a surge in research efforts towards utilizing computer-based techniques to analyze skin lesion images to identify malignancies. This paper introduces an optimized vision transformer approach for effectively classifying skin tumors. The methodology begins with a pre-processing step aimed at preserving color constancy, eliminating hair artifacts, and reducing image noise. Here, a combination of techniques such as piecewise linear bottom hat filtering, adaptive median filtering, Gaussian filtering, and an enhanced gradient intensity method is used for pre-processing. Afterwards, the segmentation phase is initiated using the self-sparse watershed algorithm on the pre-processed image. Subsequently, the segmented image is passed through a feature extraction stage where the hybrid Walsh-Hadamard Karhunen–Loeve expansion technique is employed. The final step involves the application of an improved vision transformer for skin cancer classification. The entire methodology is implemented using the Python programming language, and the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019 database is utilized for experimentation. The experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance with the different performance metrics is accuracy 99.81%, precision 96.65%, sensitivity 98.21%, F-measure 97.42%, specificity 99.88%, recall 98.21%, Jaccard coefficient 98.54%, and Mathew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) 98.89%.

This research uses machine learning algorithms to prove the hypothesis that it is possible to find correlations between news information and water resource problems.

A platform for the visualization of spatiotemporal information was developed as a proof of concept. There has been a noticeable increase in digital news about the Magdalena River Basin in recent years and some correlation with extreme events, but the comparison between the sentiments and measured physical variables was inconclusive. This is likely due to the difficulty in filtering the topic from obtained news, as well as in precisely identifying the spatial location and temporal range of events.

A platform for the visualization of spatiotemporal information was developed as a proof of concept. There has been a noticeable increase in digital news about the Magdalena River Basin in recent years and some correlation with extreme events, but the comparison between the sentiments and measured physical variables was inconclusive. This is likely due to the difficulty in filtering the topic from obtained news, as well as in precisely identifying the spatial location and temporal range of events. In the future, NLP techniques to analyze news articles could be used to provide additional information for decision making at the basin level. © 2024 American Geophysical Union.

Pant M.; Pant T.,2024,19,7 July,,,"The laboratory-scale (in-vitro) microbial fermentation based on screening of process parameters (factors) and statistical validation of parameters (responses) using regression analysis. The recent trends have shifted from full factorial design towards more complex response surface methodology designs such as Box-Behnken design, Central Composite design. Apart from the optimisation methodologies, the listed designs are not flexible enough in deducing properties of parameters in terms of class variables. Machine learning algorithms have unique visualisations for the dataset presented with appropriate learning algorithms. The classification algorithms cannot be applied on all datasets and selection of classifier is essential in this regard. To resolve this issue, factor-response relationship needs to be evaluated as dataset and subsequent preprocessing could lead to appropriate results. The aim of the current study was to investigate the data-mining accuracy on the dataset developed using in-vitro pyruvate production using organic sources for the first time. The attributes were subjected to comparative classification on various classifiers and based on accuracy, multilayer perceptron (neural network algorithm) was selected as classifier. As per the results, the model showed significant results for prediction of classes and a good fit. The learning curve developed also showed the datasets converging and were linearly separable. © 2024 Pant, Pant.

Sun W.; Chang L.-C.; Chang F.-J.,2024,636,,,,"Groundwater, an essential water resource in Taiwan, is closely linked to land subsidence in the Zhuoshui River basin due to excessive exploitation. Therefore, there is a critical need for robust monitoring and predictive tools to facilitate effective management of water resources. Despite the success of Transformer neural networks in natural language processing, their potential in environmental research remains underexplored. This study explores the feasibility of employing a Transformer-based deep neural network to simultaneously predict groundwater levels at eight strategically positioned monitoring stations in the distal fan of the Zhuoshui River basin in central Taiwan. Utilizing a 20-year dataset with 10-day intervals, we compare the Transformer model with benchmarks established separately by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), and the Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN). Results reveal the Transformer's superior performance in predicting groundwater levels 10 and 20 days in advance. This achievement is attributed to Transformer's self-attention mechanism capable of capturing relationships between factors like rainfall and river flow, enhancing accuracy in predicting trends and peak values. This groundbreaking study underscores the Transformer model's efficacy in groundwater level prediction, emphasizing its significance for sustainable water resource management amid climate change.

This research examines Fb data from 2016 to 2024 to investigate the role of online engagement in drought management. This study evaluates public discourse on drought-related matters through the analysis of five fundamental terms. The research employs topic modeling and sentiment analysis to assess regional awareness and utilizes machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) in conjunction with Bag of Words to forecast drought progression. The research highlights the potential of Fb data in facilitating real-time drought management, offering significant hydrological insights. The study elucidates regional disparities in drought awareness through the examination of key terminology and sentiment, revealing that some regions exhibit a more rapid reaction to water scarcity, as indicated by Fb engagement. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes facilitates a predictive paradigm for detecting prospective drought hotspots through online discourse analysis. The study confirmed that participation in online communities successfully (p ≤ 0.04) alleviates the impact of drought and, on Facebook, significantly enhanced drought awareness across various regions of Pakistan (p ≤ 0.5), as confirmed through statistical analysis with a paired t-test and regression analysis over labeled sentiment and topic-classified data. Fb engagement may function as a proactive indicator, assisting policymakers and hydrologists in optimizing water resource allocation in drought-prone areas, thus enhancing drought mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",00489697,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.179862,Elsevier B.V.,Drought (slow-onset disaster); Large language model (LLM); Machine learning (ML); Natural hazard; Natural language processing (NLP); Public attitudes,Harnessing public sentiment discourse for early drought detection and water crisis response for strategic water management and resilient policy planning,"College of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China; School of Management and Economics, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, 450046, China; Department of Artificial Intelligence, Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science & Technology, Nawabshah, 67450, Pakistan; College of Water Conservancy and Transportation, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China; School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China",,,"This work was supported by the Talent Scientific Research Startup Fund Projects ( 2023RCKJ0048 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51922065 , 52279069 ), and Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52179018 ).

This research examines Fb data from 2016 to 2024 to investigate the role of online engagement in drought management. This study evaluates public discourse on drought-related matters through the analysis of five fundamental terms. The research employs topic modeling and sentiment analysis to assess regional awareness and utilizes machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) in conjunction with Bag of Words to forecast drought progression. The research highlights the potential of Fb data in facilitating real-time drought management, offering significant hydrological insights. The study elucidates regional disparities in drought awareness through the examination of key terminology and sentiment, revealing that some regions exhibit a more rapid reaction to water scarcity, as indicated by Fb engagement. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes facilitates a predictive paradigm for detecting prospective drought hotspots through online discourse analysis. The study confirmed that participation in online communities successfully (p ≤ 0.04) alleviates the impact of drought and, on Facebook, significantly enhanced drought awareness across various regions of Pakistan (p ≤ 0.5), as confirmed through statistical analysis with a paired t-test and regression analysis over labeled sentiment and topic-classified data. Fb engagement may function as a proactive indicator, assisting policymakers and hydrologists in optimizing water resource allocation in drought-prone areas, thus enhancing drought mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V. 2025"

Fernández-Vargas G.,2020,23,2,,,"The fulfi llment of the Sustainable Development Goal, SDG, No 6 ""Clean Water and Sanitation"", promulgated in 2015 by the UN, requires new approaches and conceptual frameworks that articulate and integrate in a practical way the interventions of Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene - WASH, with the Integrated Water Resources Management, IWRM, according to the specifi c contexts of each territory. In this sense, water governance provides a conceptual framework that allows analyzing and enhancing integration between WASH sectors with IWRM, within the framework of the fulfi llment of the SDGs. For this, several case studies in Latin America were documented where sectoral integration was observed, based on the Water Governance Facility model of Water Governance. Although each of the case studies is framed in some specifi c function of water governance, all require at least one other function in order to achieve their purpose, with ""Coordination"" being the most relevant observed for the achievement of obtained results. © 2020 Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales U.D.C.A.

In this sense, water governance provides a conceptual framework that allows analyzing and enhancing integration between WASH sectors with IWRM, within the framework of the fulfi llment of the SDGs. For this, several case studies in Latin America were documented where sectoral integration was observed, based on the Water Governance Facility model of Water Governance.

Karnatapu L.K.; Annavarapu S.P.; Nanduri U.V.,2020,101,1,105,115,"This paper presents a genetic algorithm and nonlinear programming (GA–NLP) hybrid model to derive steady state optimal reservoir operating policies for a multi-purpose reservoir. In the present study, the objective is maximizing the net benefits from all the crops in the command area considering yield response to water deficit and the hydro-power generation subject to constraints on reservoir water balance, storage bounds, channel capacities and minimum water requirements. Decision variables of the model are fortnight water allocations to each crop and d/s release for hydro-power generation. The model developed is applied to the Nagarjunasagar multi-purpose reservoir in Andhra Pradesh, India. Reservoir operating policies are developed for three strategies by fixing appropriate weightages to irrigation and power generation in the objective function. Various levels of dependable inflows entering into the reservoir (75% and 80%) are considered in each strategy in the present study. Optimal policies obtained by the proposed model are validated through simulation and compared with standard operating policy (SOP). Reliability of meeting minimum flow requirements with developed policy is found to be superior to SOP. Trade-off curve is developed for the both objectives, and equal priority case is found to be superior yielding maximum total benefit from the project. The results obtained using the proposed model give many alternative strategies for the multi-purpose reservoir managers to take decisions. Results reveal that GA–NLP model can be effectively used for optimal allocation of limited available water resources to any reservoir. © 2019, The Institution of Engineers (India).",22502149,10.1007/s40030-019-00419-2,Springer,Crop water allocation; Genetic algorithm; Hybrid approach; Hydro-power production; Nonlinear programming; Reservoir operation; Simulation,Multi-Objective Reservoir Operating Strategies by Genetic Algorithm and Nonlinear Programming (GA–NLP) Hybrid Approach,"Department of Civil Engineering, R.V.R & J.C.

"Jatin Bedi, Durga Toshniwal,",2022,80.0,,103706.0,103706.0,"Micro-blogging social site Twitter has emerged as a rich source of unstructured text information which could be processed and analysed to extract people’s opinions about several topics and events including natural hazards, energy, sports, transportation, elections etc. The present research study adds a novel perspective in this dimension by extracting citizens’ opinions on several electricity-related issues. Recent research studies in this domain have employed Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for the numerical representation of tweets. However, the BoW model suffers from several issues such as incapable of handling the semantic relationship between words, sparse and high dimensional representation. The present research work overcomes all aforementioned shortcomings by integrating popular word-embeddings with deep learning models for the classification tasks. The study harnesses social media data for two classification tasks: Sentiment classification task and Complaints classification task. Firstly, a series of preprocessing steps are applied on tweets extracted from Twitter streaming API. Subsequently, different word-embeddings models are employed to generate a numerical representation of tweets while capturing the semantic relationship among words. Several deep learning-based sentiment classification models are then deployed on top of generated word-embeddings for identifying/classifying citizens’ sentiments from the tweets. Lastly, the tweets associated with negative sentiment class (identified by the sentiment classification model) are further processed and analysed for building the complaints classification model.

Recent research studies in this domain have employed Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for the numerical representation of tweets. However, the BoW model suffers from several issues such as incapable of handling the semantic relationship between words, sparse and high dimensional representation. The present research work overcomes all aforementioned shortcomings by integrating popular word-embeddings with deep learning models for the classification tasks. The study harnesses social media data for two classification tasks: Sentiment classification task and Complaints classification task. Firstly, a series of preprocessing steps are applied on tweets extracted from Twitter streaming API. Subsequently, different word-embeddings models are employed to generate a numerical representation of tweets while capturing the semantic relationship among words. Several deep learning-based sentiment classification models are then deployed on top of generated word-embeddings for identifying/classifying citizens’ sentiments from the tweets. Lastly, the tweets associated with negative sentiment class (identified by the sentiment classification model) are further processed and analysed for building the complaints classification model. The complaints classification model prioritize and assign negative sentiment tweets into one of the two target classes depending on the target issue raised in the tweets (Community level or recurring complaint and Individual level complaint). In addition to this, the current study also proposes Bi-directional Encoded Representations for Transformers (BERT) based Sentiment classification and Complaints classification models for achieving the improved classification accuracy.

Topic modelling and sentiment analysis are carried out using Twitter data. The native language responses from Facebook forums related to PWDs are analysed manually to construct taxonomy of problematic content Findings The results show that problematic content toward PWDs in the social media occurs during a flood. The extreme and exploitative content results in disability exclusion. Thus, e-participants fail to address the actual disability-specific requirements through social media during a disaster.

With the emergence of ubiquitous technology and devices in recent times, social media data with its higher spatio-temporal coverage has become a potential alternative for understanding evacuation behaviour during hurricanes. However, these data are often associated with selection bias and population representativeness issues. To that extent, the current study proposes a novel data fusion algorithm to combine heterogeneous data sources from transportation systems and social media, in a unified framework to understand and predict real-time population response during hurricanes.

With the emergence of ubiquitous technology and devices in recent times, social media data with its higher spatio-temporal coverage has become a potential alternative for understanding evacuation behaviour during hurricanes. However, these data are often associated with selection bias and population representativeness issues. To that extent, the current study proposes a novel data fusion algorithm to combine heterogeneous data sources from transportation systems and social media, in a unified framework to understand and predict real-time population response during hurricanes.

Additionally, IDRISI-RE contains about 56.6k automatically-labeled tweets that we offer as a silver dataset. To highlight the superiority of IDRISI-RE over past efforts, we present rigorous analyses on reliability, consistency, coverage, diversity, and generalizability. Furthermore, we benchmark IDRISI-RE using a representative set of LMR models to provide the community with baselines for future work. Our extensive empirical analysis shows the promising generalizability of IDRISI-RE compared to existing datasets. We show that models trained on IDRISI-RE better tackle domain shifts and are less susceptible to change in geographical areas. 2023"

Retweeting or resharing nature has made Twitter a popular medium of information dissemination. The purpose of this article is to enhance our understanding of both linguistic style and content properties (i.e. both affective and informational contents) that drives resharing behavior or virality of disaster messages on Twitter. We investigate this issue in the context of natural disaster crisis. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors develop, drawing upon language expectancy and uncertainty reduction theories as an enabling framework, hypotheses about how the language (i.e. style and content) influence resharing behavior. They employ a natural language processing of disaster tweets to examine how the language – linguistic style (concrete and interactive language) and linguistic content (information- and affect-focused language) – affects resharing behavior on Twitter during natural disasters. To examine the effects of both linguistic style and content factors on virality, a series of negative binomial regressions were conducted, particularly owing to the highly skewed count data. Findings Our analysis of tweets from the 2013 Colorado floods shows that resharing disasters tweets increases with the use of concrete language style during acute emergencies. Interactive language is also positively associated with retweet frequency. In addition, neither positive nor negative emotional tweets drive down resharing during acute crises, while information-focused language content has a significantly positive effect on virality. Practical implications Agencies for public safety and disaster management or volunteer organizations involved in disseminating crisis and risk information to the public may leverage the impacts of the linguistic style and language content through the lens of our research model. The findings encourage practitioners to focus on the role of linguistic style cues during acute disasters. Specifically, from the uncertainty reduction perspective, using concrete language in the disaster tweets is the expected norm, leading to a higher likelihood of virality. Also, interactively frame disaster tweets are more likely to be diffused to a larger number of people on Twitter.

Based on these two types of data, we combined with terrain, land use, traffic and infrastructure data related to flooding, a real-time flood prediction model was constructed using the random forest algorithm with a basic unit of a 70 m × 70 m grid. An analysis of the model accuracy showed that, the model that included both GPS and Twitter data showed an improvement in prediction accuracy of about 8% compared to flood prediction models that do not have these data sources. This indicated that the integrated use of Twitter and GPS data allowed us for a more accurate representation of the dynamic characteristics of flood disasters, thereby improving the performance of real-time flood prediction models and increasing real-time awareness of flood events. This approach provided effective flood monitoring methods for disaster management authorities. 2024"

Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate MRME-Net on the MAVEN and Twitter dataset, revealing a notable improvement of 3 %–13 %, 4 %–20 % and 6 %–30 % increases on NMI, AMI and ARI in the social event detection task. 2024"

Furthermore, general-purpose sentence encoders are used to generate sentence embeddings, regardless of the textual complexities in crisis-related texts. Advances in applications like text classification, semantic search, and clustering contribute to the effective processing of crisis-related texts, which is essential for emergency responders to gain a comprehensive view of a crisis event, whether historical or real-time. To address these gaps in crisis informatics literature, this study introduces CrisisTransformers, an ensemble of pre-trained language models and sentence encoders trained on an extensive corpus of over 15 billion word tokens from tweets associated with more than 30 crisis events, including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflicts, and other critical incidents.

Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa have shown success in various NLP tasks, but they are not tailored for crisis-related texts. Furthermore, general-purpose sentence encoders are used to generate sentence embeddings, regardless of the textual complexities in crisis-related texts. Advances in applications like text classification, semantic search, and clustering contribute to the effective processing of crisis-related texts, which is essential for emergency responders to gain a comprehensive view of a crisis event, whether historical or real-time. To address these gaps in crisis informatics literature, this study introduces CrisisTransformers, an ensemble of pre-trained language models and sentence encoders trained on an extensive corpus of over 15 billion word tokens from tweets associated with more than 30 crisis events, including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflicts, and other critical incidents. We evaluate existing models and CrisisTransformers on 18 crisis-specific public datasets.

Hence, this paper utilizes the back propagation neural network (BPNN) to optimize the security risk assessment model. A key challenge of researching community security risk assessment lies in accurately identifying and predicting a range of potential security threats. These threats may encompass natural disasters, public health crises, accidents, and social security issues. The intricate interplay of these risk factors, combined with the dynamic nature of community environments, presents difficulties for traditional risk assessment methodologies to address effectively. Initially, this paper delves into the factors influencing safety incidents within communities and establishes a comprehensive system of safety risk assessment indicators. Leveraging the adaptable and generalizable nature of the BPNN model, the paper proceeds to optimize the BPNN model, enhancing the security risk assessment model through this optimization. Subsequent comparison experiments with traditional models validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model, with hidden layer nodes set at various levels like 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. These traditional models include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST).

Maltese architects/engineers submit a concise but detailed description of the proposed works on any given site as part of a planning process. It is suggested that valuable insights exist within this description that can assist in classifying buildings within the bounds of the GED4ALL taxonomy. NLP can be used to layer additional, building-by-building information onto existing exposure models based on more conventional data. Although the results of this study are preliminary, NLP may prove a valuable tool for enhancing exposure modeling for multi-hazard risk quantification and management. 2023"

Therefore, we propose a model to focus on the in-depth understanding of social media texts while involving minimum manual efforts in a semi-supervised manner. This paper introduces a novel method to evaluate the damage extent indicated by social media texts. The damage reports are recognized among the social media messages as damage relation categories by a multi-instance multi-class classifier, and the damage extent implied by the words in a report is quantified by measuring the word similarity with the known damage-related words.
